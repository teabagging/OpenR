The circle is radius 1 centered at the origin. The lines are all possible y = ax + b where a and b are different natural numbers (so starting from 1) not greater than 20. But a and b have to be different. So for each a from 1 to 20, b goes from 1 to 20 excluding a. So for example, when a=1, b can be 2 to 20, giving lines like y=x+2, y=x+3,...,y=x+20. Similarly, when a=2, b is 1,3,...,20, so lines like y=2x+1, y=2x+3,...,y=2x+20. And so on up to a=20. Then Vasya&#39;s circle is x² + y² = 1. The question is how many of these lines intersect this circle.First, I need to recall the condition for a line y = ax + b to intersect the circle x² + y² = 1. To find if they intersect, we can solve the system:x² + (ax + b)² = 1Expanding that:x² + a²x² + 2abx + b² = 1(1 + a²)x² + 2abx + (b² - 1) = 0This is a quadratic equation in x. For the line to intersect the circle, this quadratic must have real solutions, so the discriminant must be non-negative.Discriminant D = (2ab)^2 - 4*(1 + a²)*(b² - 1)Compute D:D = 4a²b² - 4(1 + a²)(b² - 1)Factor out the 4:D = 4[ a²b² - (1 + a²)(b² - 1) ]Compute inside the brackets:a²b² - (1 + a²)(b² - 1) = a²b² - [ (1)(b² - 1) + a²(b² - 1) ]= a²b² - b² + 1 - a²b² + a²Simplify:a²b² - b² + 1 - a²b² + a² = -b² + 1 + a²So D = 4[ a² - b² + 1 ]Therefore, for the line to intersect the circle, the discriminant must be ≥ 0:a² - b² + 1 ≥ 0So a² + 1 ≥ b²Therefore, the condition is b² ≤ a² + 1So for each pair (a, b) where a and b are natural numbers from 1 to 20, with a ≠ b, the line y = ax + b intersects the circle x² + y² = 1 if and only if b² ≤ a² + 1.Therefore, our problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (a, b) with a ≠ b, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 20, such that b² ≤ a² + 1.So now the task is to count, for each a from 1 to 20, the number of b&#39;s (from 1 to 20, excluding b = a) such that b² ≤ a² + 1.So let&#39;s think about how to compute this.For each a, we need to find all b&#39;s where b ≤ sqrt(a² + 1). But since b must be an integer, the maximum b that satisfies this is floor(sqrt(a² + 1)).But wait, since a and b are natural numbers, and we have to exclude b = a.So for each a, the number of valid b&#39;s is the number of integers b in [1, floor(sqrt(a² + 1))] excluding b = a (if a is in that interval).But first, let&#39;s compute floor(sqrt(a² + 1)).sqrt(a² + 1) is slightly more than a. So floor(sqrt(a² + 1)) = a, since sqrt(a² + 1) is between a and a+1. Because (a + 1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1, so sqrt(a² + 1) &lt; a + 1. Similarly, sqrt(a² + 1) &gt; a. Therefore, floor(sqrt(a² + 1)) = a.Wait, but that would mean that b must satisfy b ≤ a. But the original problem is that the lines are y = ax + b with a and b different natural numbers. So if for each a, the possible b&#39;s are 1 to 20 except b = a. But according to the discriminant condition, the acceptable b&#39;s are those where b² ≤ a² + 1. Since b is an integer, and sqrt(a² + 1) is slightly larger than a, so the maximum integer b that satisfies b² ≤ a² + 1 is a, because (a+1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1 which is larger than a² + 1, so b can be at most a.But if b has to be ≤ a, but also b is from 1 to 20, and b ≠ a. Wait, but if the maximum b is a, but b ≠ a, then the possible b&#39;s are 1 to a-1. Wait, but then floor(sqrt(a² + 1)) is a, so b can be up to a, but since b ≠ a, then b can be from 1 to a-1. So for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a - 1. But that seems too straightforward.Wait, let&#39;s check with a specific example. Let&#39;s take a = 1.Then sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. So floor(sqrt(2)) = 1. So b must be ≤1. But since b ≠ a =1, so b cannot be 1. So there are zero b&#39;s. But wait, for a=1, the lines are y =1x + b, where b is from 2 to 20. So according to our earlier logic, since b must be ≤ floor(sqrt(1 +1))=1, but b starts from 2, so there are no lines for a=1 that intersect the circle. But that can&#39;t be right.Wait, wait, something&#39;s wrong here. Let&#39;s double-check. If a=1, then the lines are y =x + b with b=2 to 20. The condition is b² &lt;= a² +1 = 1 +1 = 2. So b² &lt;= 2. So b can be 1, since 1²=1 &lt;=2. But for a=1, the lines have b from 2 to 20, so none of them satisfy b² &lt;=2. Therefore, a=1 contributes 0 lines.Similarly, let&#39;s check a=2.Then a=2, the lines are y=2x + b where b is from 1,3,4,...,20 (since b≠2). The condition is b² &lt;= 2² +1=5. So b² &lt;=5. So b can be 1,2 (since 2²=4&lt;=5). But for a=2, b cannot be 2, so only b=1. So b=1 is allowed. So that&#39;s 1 line.Wait, but for a=2, the lines are b from 1 to 20 excluding 2. So b=1 is allowed. So 1 line.Similarly, a=3: a² +1=10. So b² &lt;=10. So b can be 1,2,3 (since 3²=9&lt;=10, 4²=16&gt;10). But since b≠3, so b=1,2. So two lines.Wait, so for a=3, the lines are y=3x + b, with b=1,2,4,...,20. But according to the condition, only b=1 and 2 satisfy b² &lt;=10. So two lines.Wait, but 3²=9 &lt;=10, but since b≠3, so we can&#39;t include b=3. So for a=3, two lines.Similarly, a=4: a² +1=17. So b² &lt;=17. So b can be 1,2,3,4 (since 4²=16 &lt;=17). Since b≠4, so b=1,2,3. So three lines.Wait, 1,2,3: three lines.Similarly, a=5: a² +1=26. So b can be up to floor(sqrt(26))=5. So b=1,2,3,4,5. But exclude b=5. So b=1,2,3,4. Four lines.Wait, but 5²=25 &lt;=26. So yes, b=5 is allowed? But the original problem says a and b are different natural numbers. So for a=5, b can be 1,2,3,4,6,...,20. But according to the condition, only those b&#39;s with b² &lt;=26. So b can be up to 5. So among those, b=1,2,3,4 (since b≠5). So four lines.Wait, but if b=5 is allowed by the condition (since 5²=25 &lt;=26), but since in the problem statement, a and b must be different, so even though b=5 would satisfy the inequality, since a=5 and b=5, which are equal, that line is not drawn. Therefore, the number of lines for a=5 is 4.Wait, so in general, for each a, the maximum b allowed is floor(sqrt(a² +1)), which is a (since sqrt(a² +1) is slightly more than a). But since we need b ≠ a, then the number of valid b&#39;s is the number of integers from 1 to a, excluding a. So that&#39;s (a -1) numbers.But wait, but in the case of a=1, sqrt(1 +1)=sqrt(2)≈1.414, so floor(sqrt(2))=1. But b has to be different from a=1, so no b&#39;s. Which matches our previous result.Similarly, for a=2, floor(sqrt(5))=2, so b can be 1 and 2. But exclude 2, so b=1. So 1 line.Wait, but sqrt(5)≈2.236, so floor is 2. So b can be up to 2, but exclude 2. So 1 line. Correct.Similarly, for a=3: sqrt(10)≈3.162, floor=3. So b can be 1,2,3. Exclude 3, so 2 lines.a=4: sqrt(17)≈4.123, floor=4. So b=1,2,3,4. Exclude 4, so 3 lines.a=5: sqrt(26)≈5.099, floor=5. So b=1,2,3,4,5. Exclude 5, so 4 lines.So in general, for each a, the number of valid b&#39;s is floor(sqrt(a² +1)) -1. But floor(sqrt(a² +1)) is a, since sqrt(a² +1) is between a and a+1, so floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a. Therefore, the number of b&#39;s is a -1. Wait, that would mean for each a, the number is a -1. But wait, let&#39;s check with a=2: 2 -1 =1, which matches. a=3: 3 -1=2, matches. a=4: 4 -1=3, matches. So seems like in general, for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a -1.But wait, but in that case, for a=1, it&#39;s 0, which is correct. So then the total number of lines intersecting the circle would be the sum from a=1 to 20 of (a -1). But the problem is that this formula would only hold if for each a, the maximum b allowed is a. But is that the case? Let&#39;s check for higher a.Take a=20. Then a² +1=400 +1=401. sqrt(401)≈20.02499, floor is 20. So b can be up to 20, but since b≠20, then b=1,...,19. So 19 lines. So yes, for a=20, it&#39;s 20 -1=19. So that holds.Wait, but this seems to suggest that for each a from 1 to 20, the number of valid b&#39;s is a -1, so the total number of lines is the sum from a=1 to 20 of (a -1). So sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1) = sum_{k=0}^{19} k = (19)(20)/2 = 190. But wait, but in the problem statement, the lines are drawn for each pair of different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20, meaning that for each a, b can be any number from 1 to 20 except a. So that&#39;s 19 numbers for each a. So there are 20*19=380 lines in total. But according to the above logic, only 190 lines intersect the circle. But that can&#39;t be correct, because not all lines with b &lt;=a would intersect the circle.Wait, no, actually, according to the condition b² &lt;=a² +1, which is equivalent to b &lt;=sqrt(a² +1). But since b is integer, then floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a. Therefore, only b from 1 to a (but b≠a) satisfy the condition. Therefore, for each a, there are (a -1) such b&#39;s. Therefore, total lines that intersect the circle would be sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1)=190. But this is only true if all such b&#39;s are within 1 to 20. But since a goes up to 20, and for a=20, b can be 1 to 19, which is within 1 to 20. So yes, this seems okay.But wait, let&#39;s check with a=1. For a=1, b can be from 1 to 1 (floor(sqrt(1 +1))=1), but b≠1, so 0 lines. For a=2, b=1, which is allowed. For a=3, b=1,2. For a=4, b=1,2,3. Etc. So the count seems okay.But wait, but there&#39;s a problem here. Because when a increases, sqrt(a² +1) is just slightly larger than a, so when a is 20, sqrt(401)≈20.024, so floor is 20, but b=20 is excluded. So b=1,...,19. But what about when a is smaller? For example, a=5: sqrt(26)=5.099, so floor is 5, so b can be up to 5, but excluding 5. So b=1,2,3,4. Which is 4 numbers, which is 5-1=4. So yes, seems consistent.But here&#39;s a catch. Suppose a=5. Then, the line y=5x +1. Does this line actually intersect the circle x² + y²=1? Let&#39;s check. The distance from the line to the origin should be less than or equal to 1 for intersection.Wait, the formula for the distance from a line ax + by + c =0 to the origin is |c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, our lines are y = ax + b. So rearranged: ax - y + b =0. So in standard form: ax - y + b =0. Therefore, the distance from the origin is |b| / sqrt(a² +1). Since b is positive, it&#39;s b / sqrt(a² +1). For the line to intersect the circle, the distance must be less than or equal to 1. So:b / sqrt(a² +1) ≤1Which is equivalent to:b ≤ sqrt(a² +1)Which is exactly the condition we derived earlier. So that&#39;s consistent. So even though the quadratic discriminant approach is correct, but thinking in terms of distance is another way. So if the distance from the line to the origin is ≤1, then the line intersects the circle.But since we already derived that the condition is b ≤ sqrt(a² +1), and since b must be integer, then the maximum b is floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a. So b must be ≤a. But since a and b are different, b must be ≤a -1? Wait, no, because even if b=a, it&#39;s excluded. But in our condition, b can be up to a (but not equal to a). Wait, but if floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a, then the maximum integer b allowed is a. But since b cannot be equal to a, the maximum b is a -1. Wait, but sqrt(a² +1) is greater than a, so the real upper bound is a number slightly greater than a, so the maximum integer less than that is a. But since b must be different from a, then even though the real upper bound is just over a, we have to exclude a, so the maximum integer allowed is a -1.Wait, but let&#39;s think numerically. Take a=2. Then sqrt(2² +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236. So b can be 1 or 2 (since 2.236). But since b≠2, so only 1. So in this case, the maximum integer b is 2, but we exclude it. So the maximum is 1. But sqrt(a² +1) is 2.236, which is more than 2, but since b must be integer, the maximum possible b is 2, but since b≠a=2, we can&#39;t use it. So in effect, the maximum b is 1. So it&#39;s like we have to take floor(min(sqrt(a² +1), a)), but since sqrt(a² +1) is always greater than a, then floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a. But since we can&#39;t have b=a, the actual maximum is a-1. Wait, but that&#39;s not necessarily true. For example, take a=3. sqrt(10)=3.162. So floor is 3. So b can be up to 3, but b≠3, so maximum 2. So in this case, sqrt(a² +1)=3.162, floor is 3, but since b≠3, the maximum allowed is 2. So the maximum allowed b is floor(sqrt(a² +1)) if floor(sqrt(a² +1)) &lt; a, but when floor(sqrt(a² +1)) =a, then it&#39;s a-1. Wait, but actually, floor(sqrt(a² +1)) is always a, because sqrt(a² +1) is between a and a+1, so floor is a. Therefore, maximum integer b allowed is a. But since b can&#39;t be equal to a, then maximum allowed is a-1. Wait, but in reality, if the distance condition is b / sqrt(a² +1) ≤1, then b ≤ sqrt(a² +1). Since sqrt(a² +1) &gt;a, then even if b=a, b=a ≤ sqrt(a² +1) (since a &lt; sqrt(a² +1)), but since b≠a, we can&#39;t include b=a. Therefore, the possible b&#39;s are 1 to floor(sqrt(a² +1)) excluding a. But floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a, so the possible b&#39;s are 1 to a, excluding a. Therefore, the count is (a -1). So that&#39;s the number of b&#39;s for each a. Therefore, the total number is sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1) = sum_{k=0}^{19} k = 190. So the answer is 190.But wait, this contradicts with the earlier specific example. For a=2, according to this, we have 1 line. But let&#39;s check if the line y=2x +1 actually intersects the circle x² + y²=1. The distance from the line 2x - y +1=0 to the origin is |1| / sqrt(2² +1)=1/sqrt(5)≈0.447, which is less than 1. So the line intersects the circle. So yes, the line y=2x +1 intersects the circle. Similarly, for a=3, the lines y=3x +1 and y=3x +2. Let&#39;s check distance for b=1: |1| / sqrt(10)≈0.316 &lt;1. For b=2: |2| / sqrt(10)≈0.632 &lt;1. So both lines intersect. For a=4, lines y=4x +1, y=4x +2, y=4x +3. Distance for b=1:1/sqrt(17)≈0.242; b=2:2/sqrt(17)≈0.485; b=3:3/sqrt(17)≈0.728, all less than 1. So yes, all three lines intersect. For a=5, lines y=5x +1, y=5x +2, y=5x +3, y=5x +4. Distances: 1/sqrt(26)≈0.196; 2/sqrt≈0.392; 3/sqrt≈0.588; 4/sqrt≈0.784, all &lt;1. So yes, four lines. So for a=5, 4 lines.Similarly, for a=20, lines y=20x +1 to y=20x +19. The distance for b=19:19/sqrt(400 +1)=19/sqrt(401)≈19/20.024≈0.949, which is less than 1. So all these 19 lines intersect the circle. So indeed, for each a, the number of lines is a-1, and total is 190.But wait, but according to this logic, all lines y=ax +b where b &lt;a would intersect the circle. But is that true? Wait, let&#39;s check a=20, b=19: as above, distance≈0.949 &lt;1. But for a=20, b=1: distance=1/sqrt(401)≈0.0499, which is very small, so the line is very close to the origin. So it definitely intersects the circle. For a=20, b=10: distance=10/sqrt(401)≈0.499, which is less than 1. So yes, all lines with b from 1 to 19 will have distance less than 1, thus intersect the circle.Similarly, for a=1, but a=1 has no lines since b must be 2-20, but none of those satisfy the condition.So according to this, the total number is 190. But wait, let me check with another approach. Let&#39;s see, for each a, the lines that intersect the circle are those where b &lt;= floor(sqrt(a² +1)) and b ≠a. Since floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a, then b &lt;=a and b≠a, so b &lt;=a-1. Wait, but that&#39;s not true. Because floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a, so b can be up to a, but since b≠a, then it&#39;s b &lt;=a. But the problem is that when we say b &lt;= sqrt(a² +1), since sqrt(a² +1) is slightly larger than a, so the integer b can be up to a. For example, a=2: sqrt(5)=2.236, so b can be 1 or 2, but since b≠2, only 1. But in this case, a=2, floor(sqrt(a² +1))=2, so b can be 1 or 2. But since b≠2, only 1. So it&#39;s equivalent to b &lt;=a and b≠a, which gives b &lt;=a-1. Wait, but in this case, yes, the number of b&#39;s is a-1. Therefore, sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1)=190.But the problem is that when a=1, the lines are y=x +2 to y=x +20. None of these lines intersect the circle. So 0 lines. For a=2, 1 line: y=2x +1. For a=3, 2 lines: y=3x +1 and y=3x +2. Continuing up to a=20, 19 lines. So adding up all these, we get 0 +1 +2 +...+19= sum_{k=0}^{19}k= (19)(20)/2=190. Therefore, the answer is 190.But I have a conflicting thought here. Let me think again. For each a, the number of lines is (number of b&#39;s with b &lt;= sqrt(a² +1)) -1 if a is in that range. Wait, but b can be up to floor(sqrt(a² +1)), which is a, as we saw. So for each a, the number of b&#39;s with b &lt;=a is a, but exclude b=a, so a-1. Therefore, yes, sum is 190.But let me check with another example. Suppose a=1. Then lines are y=x +2 to y=x +20. These are lines with slope 1 and y-intercepts from 2 to 20. The distance from the origin is |b| / sqrt(1 +1)=b / sqrt(2). For intersection, this must be &lt;=1. So b &lt;=sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2)≈1.414, so b must be &lt;=1.414. But since b starts at 2, none of these lines intersect. So 0 lines. Correct.For a=2, lines y=2x +1 and y=2x +3 to y=2x +20. Wait, no. Wait, for a=2, b is from 1 to 20 excluding 2. So lines are y=2x +1, y=2x +3, ..., y=2x +20. The condition is b &lt;=sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5)≈2.236. So only b=1 and 2 are allowed. But b cannot be 2, so only b=1. So 1 line. Correct.Similarly, for a=3, sqrt(9 +1)=sqrt(10)≈3.162. So b can be 1,2,3. But exclude 3. So 2 lines. Correct.Therefore, the formula holds. Therefore, the total number of lines is 190.But wait, but in the problem statement, the lines are drawn for each pair of different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20. So total number of lines is 20*19=380. So half of them intersect the circle. That seems a lot. But according to the calculation, yes.Wait, but perhaps my initial reasoning is wrong. Let&#39;s check for a=10. For a=10, sqrt(100 +1)=sqrt(101)≈10.05. So floor is 10. So b can be 1 to10, excluding 10. So b=1 to9. So 9 lines. The distance for b=9 is 9/sqrt(101)≈0.896 &lt;1. So yes, it intersects. Similarly, for a=20, b=19:19/sqrt(401)≈0.949 &lt;1. So yes, intersects.But is there a case where b &lt;=a but the distance is still greater than 1? Let&#39;s see. Take a=1, b=1: distance 1/sqrt(2)≈0.707 &lt;1. But in this case, a=1 and b=1 are excluded. If they weren&#39;t excluded, then the line y=x +1 would have distance≈0.707. But since b≠a, we exclude it. For a=1, all b&#39;s start at 2, which are higher than sqrt(2). So no intersection.Wait, but let&#39;s think for a=0. But a starts at 1. So no, a is at least 1. So all lines with b &lt;=a will have distances b/sqrt(a² +1). Since b &lt;=a, then b/sqrt(a² +1) &lt;=a / sqrt(a² +1)=sqrt(a²/(a² +1))=sqrt(1 -1/(a² +1)) &lt;1. Therefore, all lines with b &lt;=a will have distance less than 1, hence intersect the circle. Therefore, if b &lt;=a and b≠a, then the line intersects. Therefore, the number of lines for each a is (number of b&#39;s &lt;=a) -1 (since b≠a). Therefore, the count is (a -1). Therefore, total sum is 190.Therefore, the answer should be 190. But let me check once more.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;each pair of different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20&quot;. So a and b are from 1 to20, a≠b. So for each a, there are 19 possible b&#39;s. But according to our condition, only those b&#39;s with b &lt;=floor(sqrt(a² +1)) and b≠a will intersect. But floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a, so b &lt;=a and b≠a, which is (a -1) values. So sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1)=190. Therefore, the answer is 190.However, I feel like I need to verify this with a few more examples.Take a=6: a² +1=37, sqrt≈6.08, floor=6. So b can be 1-6, but exclude 6. So b=1-5. Five lines. The distances would be 1/sqrt(37)≈0.164, 2/sqrt≈0.328, 3/sqrt≈0.492, 4/sqrt≈0.656, 5/sqrt≈0.821. All less than 1. So yes, all five lines intersect.Similarly, for a=10: b=1-9. The distance for b=9:9/sqrt(101)≈0.896 &lt;1.For a=15: b=1-14. The distance for b=14:14/sqrt(226)≈14/15.03≈0.932 &lt;1.For a=20: b=1-19. Distance for b=19:≈0.949 &lt;1.All these are indeed less than 1. Therefore, all lines counted by the formula actually intersect the circle. Therefore, the total number is 190.But wait, but according to the problem statement, the lines are y=ax +b where a and b are different natural numbers not greater than 20. So for each a, the excluded b is only when b=a. So for example, when a=1, b can be 2-20. But according to our condition, none of these lines intersect, which is correct. For a=2, b=1,3-20. But only b=1 satisfies b² &lt;=5. So 1 line. For a=3, b=1,2,4-20. But only b=1 and 2 satisfy b² &lt;=10. So two lines, etc.Therefore, the formula is correct, and the total number is 190.However, I recall that in some cases, even if b &lt;=a, the line might not intersect the circle if the distance is exactly 1. But in our case, the distance is strictly less than 1. Because distance =b / sqrt(a² +1). Since b &lt;=a, and sqrt(a² +1) &gt;a, then b / sqrt(a² +1) &lt; a /a=1. Therefore, the distance is always strictly less than 1, so the line intersects the circle at two distinct points. Therefore, all lines counted by this method do intersect the circle.Therefore, the answer should be 190.But wait, let me check once more with a=2, b=1: y=2x +1. Plug into the circle equation:x² + (2x +1)^2 =x² +4x² +4x +1=5x² +4x +1=1 ⇒5x² +4x=0 ⇒x(5x +4)=0. Solutions x=0 and x=-4/5. So points (0,1) and (-4/5, -3/5). Both points are on the circle. Therefore, intersects.Similarly, for a=20, b=19: y=20x +19. The distance is 19/sqrt(401)≈0.949. Less than 1, so intersects. The solutions would be two points. So yes, intersects.Therefore, all 190 lines intersect the circle. Therefore, the answer is 190.But to make sure, let&#39;s compute the sum:Sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1)= Sum_{a=1}^{20} a - Sum_{a=1}^{20}1= (20*21)/2 -20=210 -20=190. Yes, that&#39;s correct.So the final answer is 190.Final Answerboxed{190}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many of Petya&#39;s lines intersect Vasya&#39;s circle, we start by analyzing the condition for a line ( y = ax + b ) to intersect the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ). Substituting ( y = ax + b ) into the circle&#39;s equation, we get:[x^2 + (ax + b)^2 = 1]Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain a quadratic equation in ( x ):[(1 + a^2)x^2 + 2abx + (b^2 - 1) = 0]For the line to intersect the circle, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative. The discriminant ( D ) is given by:[D = (2ab)^2 - 4(1 + a^2)(b^2 - 1)]Simplifying the discriminant, we find:[D = 4[a^2b^2 - (1 + a^2)(b^2 - 1)] = 4[a^2 - b^2 + 1]]For the discriminant to be non-negative, we need:[a^2 - b^2 + 1 geq 0 implies b^2 leq a^2 + 1]This implies ( b leq sqrt{a^2 + 1} ). Since ( b ) must be a natural number, the maximum value of ( b ) is ( lfloor sqrt{a^2 + 1} rfloor ). For each ( a ), ( sqrt{a^2 + 1} ) is slightly more than ( a ), so ( lfloor sqrt{a^2 + 1} rfloor = a ). Therefore, ( b ) must be an integer from 1 to ( a ), but excluding ( a ) (since ( a ) and ( b ) must be different). Thus, the number of valid ( b ) values for each ( a ) is ( a - 1 ).Summing this over all ( a ) from 1 to 20:[sum_{a=1}^{20} (a - 1) = sum_{a=1}^{20} a - sum_{a=1}^{20} 1 = frac{20 cdot 21}{2} - 20 = 210 - 20 = 190]Thus, the number of lines that intersect the circle is (boxed{190}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, Petya drew all these lines y = ax + b where a and b are different natural numbers not greater than 20. That means for each a from 1 to 20, he draws lines with all b from 1 to 20 except when b equals a. Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;each pair of different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20.&quot; Hmm, so maybe a and b just have to be different, not that b can&#39;t equal a. Wait, no, the original statement is &quot;each pair of different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20&quot;, so that would mean all pairs where a ≠ b, right? So for example, when a=1, b can be from 2 to 20, so 19 lines, then a=2, b from 1 to 20 except 2, so 19 lines, etc. So in total, for each a, 19 lines, and since a ranges from 1 to 20, the total number of lines is 20*19 = 380. But maybe that&#39;s not directly important right now.Vasya drew a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The question is how many of Petya&#39;s lines intersect this circle.So, to solve this, we need to find the number of lines y = ax + b (with a ≠ b, a,b ∈ {1,2,...,20}) that intersect the circle x² + y² = 1.First, I need to recall how to determine whether a line intersects a circle. The general method is to solve the system of equations consisting of the line and the circle, and check if there are real solutions. If there are, the line intersects the circle; if not, it doesn&#39;t.So, substituting y = ax + b into the circle equation x² + y² = 1 gives:x² + (ax + b)² = 1Expanding that:x² + a²x² + 2abx + b² - 1 = 0Combine like terms:(1 + a²)x² + 2abx + (b² - 1) = 0This is a quadratic equation in x. For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative. The discriminant D is:D = (2ab)^2 - 4*(1 + a²)*(b² - 1)Simplify D:D = 4a²b² - 4*(1 + a²)*(b² - 1)Factor out the 4:D = 4[ a²b² - (1 + a²)(b² - 1) ]Now compute the term inside the brackets:a²b² - (1 + a²)(b² - 1) = a²b² - [b² - 1 + a²b² - a²] = a²b² - b² + 1 - a²b² + a²Simplify:= -b² + 1 + a²So D = 4(-b² + 1 + a²) = 4(a² - b² + 1)Therefore, the discriminant D = 4(a² - b² + 1)For the quadratic to have real solutions, D ≥ 0. Since 4 is positive, this is equivalent to:a² - b² + 1 ≥ 0So:a² - b² + 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a² - b² ≥ -1 ⇒ a² ≥ b² - 1Therefore, the condition is a² ≥ b² - 1. If this holds, the line y = ax + b intersects the circle x² + y² = 1. Otherwise, it doesn&#39;t.So now, the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (a, b) with a ≠ b, a, b ∈ {1, 2, ..., 20}, such that a² ≥ b² - 1.Alternatively, since a and b are natural numbers, we can rephrase the inequality:a² + 1 ≥ b²So, the line intersects the circle if and only if a² + 1 ≥ b².Wait, let me check that. From the discriminant condition:a² - b² + 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a² + 1 ≥ b². Yes, exactly.So, we need to count the number of pairs (a, b) where a and b are distinct natural numbers from 1 to 20, and a² + 1 ≥ b².Therefore, the problem reduces to:For each a from 1 to 20, count the number of b&#39;s (from 1 to 20, b ≠ a) such that b² ≤ a² + 1. Then sum over all a.Therefore, the strategy is:1. For each a in 1 to 20:   a. Compute a² + 1.   b. Find how many integers b in 1 to 20 (excluding b = a) satisfy b² ≤ a² + 1.2. Sum these counts over all a.Therefore, we can proceed step by step for each a.But before going into each a, maybe we can see if there&#39;s a pattern or a formula.Given that a and b are integers between 1 and 20, and we need to count for each a, the number of b ≠ a with b² ≤ a² + 1.Note that b² ≤ a² + 1 implies that b ≤ sqrt(a² + 1). Since b must be an integer, the maximum possible b is floor(sqrt(a² + 1)).But sqrt(a² + 1) is slightly larger than a, so floor(sqrt(a² + 1)) would be equal to a, except when sqrt(a² + 1) is greater than a but less than a + 1. Let&#39;s check:sqrt(a² + 1) is always between a and a + 1, since (a + 1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1, which is greater than a² + 1. So sqrt(a² + 1) is between a and a + 1, so floor(sqrt(a² + 1)) = a.Therefore, the maximum integer b satisfying b² ≤ a² + 1 is a.Therefore, for each a, the values of b that satisfy b² ≤ a² + 1 are b = 1, 2, ..., a. Because b can be up to a, since (a + 1)^2 = a² + 2a + 1 &gt; a² + 1, so b cannot be a + 1 or higher.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s check for a specific a. Let&#39;s take a = 1.Then a² + 1 = 2. So b² ≤ 2. So b can be 1, since 1² = 1 ≤ 2, and 2² = 4 &gt; 2. So for a = 1, b can be 1, but since b must be different from a (which is 1), so actually, no possible b? Wait, but the original problem says &quot;each pair of different natural numbers a and b&quot;, so a and b must be different. So for a = 1, b can be from 2 to 20, but how many of those satisfy b² ≤ 1² + 1 = 2. Since 2² = 4 &gt; 2, so none. Therefore, for a = 1, count is 0.Wait, but according to the previous logic, maximum b would be a, but here a = 1, so maximum b is 1, but b must be different from a, so b cannot be 1. Hence, no solutions. So count is 0 for a = 1.Similarly, for a = 2, a² + 1 = 5. So b² ≤ 5. So b can be 1, 2, since 1² = 1, 2² = 4 ≤ 5, and 3² = 9 &gt; 5. But b must be different from a = 2. So allowed b&#39;s are 1. So count is 1.Wait, but 2 is excluded, so only b = 1. So for a = 2, count is 1.Wait, let&#39;s check a = 3. a² + 1 = 10. So b² ≤ 10. b can be 1, 2, 3, since 3² = 9 ≤ 10, 4² = 16 &gt; 10. But since a = 3, b must be different. So allowed b&#39;s are 1, 2. So count is 2.Similarly, for a = 4: a² + 1 = 17. b² ≤ 17. b can be 1, 2, 3, 4 (4² = 16 ≤17). Excluding b = 4, so count is 3.a = 5: a² + 1 = 26. b² ≤ 26. So b can be up to 5, since 5² = 25 ≤26, 6² = 36 &gt;26. Excluding b = 5, so count is 4.Wait a pattern here: For a ≥1, the count for each a is (a -1). Because for each a, the maximum b is a (since sqrt(a² +1) ≈ a + 0. something, so floor is a). So possible b&#39;s are 1,2,...,a. But excluding b = a, so number of b&#39;s is a -1. But wait, only if all those b&#39;s from 1 to a-1 satisfy b² ≤ a² +1. Is that the case?Wait, for example, take a=5. Then a² +1=26. The maximum b such that b² ≤26 is 5, since 5²=25, 6²=36. So for b=1 to 5, but exclude b=5. Wait, but wait, b=5 is allowed in the inequality, but since a=5 and b must be different from a, so b=5 is excluded. So the count is 4, which is 5-1=4. Similarly, for a=4: 4-1=3. For a=3: 3-1=2. For a=2: 2-1=1. For a=1: 1-1=0. So this seems to hold.But wait, let&#39;s check for a=6. a² +1=37. So b² ≤37. The square root of 37 is about 6.08. So floor(sqrt(37))=6. So b can be up to 6. But since a=6, exclude b=6. So count is 6-1=5. Let&#39;s check: b=1,2,3,4,5. 5 numbers. Each of these b&#39;s squared is ≤37. 5²=25 ≤37, yes. So yes, count is 5.Similarly, a=10. a² +1=101. sqrt(101)≈10.05, so floor is 10. So b can be up to 10. Excluding b=10, so count=10-1=9. But check if b=10 is excluded. Wait, but a=10, so b must be different. So for a=10, possible b&#39;s are 1-9, 11-20. Wait, but the condition is b² ≤101. So 10²=100 ≤101, but b=10 is not allowed because a=10. Wait, but wait, the maximum b allowed by the inequality is 10, but since b ≠a=10, so the allowed b&#39;s are 1-9, since 10 is excluded. Wait, but hold on: sqrt(101)≈10.05, so b can be 1-10, but since b≠10, so 1-9. So actually, the count is 9. But according to the formula a-1=10-1=9. So that works.Wait, but let&#39;s check when a=11. a² +1=121 +1=122. sqrt(122)≈11.045. So floor is 11. So b can be 1-11. But b≠11, so allowed b&#39;s are 1-10. But wait, 11²=121 ≤122, so b=11 is allowed by the inequality, but since b≠a=11, it&#39;s excluded. So count is 10. But according to a-1=11-1=10. So that works. Similarly for a=20: a² +1=400 +1=401. sqrt(401)=20.02499..., so floor is 20. So allowed b&#39;s are 1-20, but b≠20, so 1-19. So count is 19. Which is 20-1=19. So this seems to hold.Therefore, if this pattern holds, then for each a from 1 to 20, the number of b&#39;s is a-1. But wait, but this assumes that all b from 1 to a-1 satisfy b² ≤ a² +1. Is this true?Wait, take a=2. Then a-1=1. The allowed b=1. Check if 1² ≤2² +1=5. 1 ≤5, yes. So that works.Take a=3: a-1=2. Check if b=1 and 2: 1²=1 ≤10, 2²=4 ≤10, yes.Take a=4: a-1=3. Check if b=1,2,3: 1,4,9 ≤17, yes.Similarly for a=5: 1,2,3,4: 1,4,9,16 ≤26, yes.a=6: 1,4,9,16,25 ≤37, yes. Wait, 5²=25 ≤37, 6²=36 ≤37. But b=6 is excluded. So yes, the counts are a-1.But wait, but suppose a=1. Then a-1=0, which is correct because there are no b&#39;s. For a=1, we can&#39;t have b=1, and other b&#39;s (2-20) all have b² &gt;=4 &gt;1² +1=2. So no lines.Similarly, for a=2, allowed b&#39;s are 1. Which works.But wait, is there a case where even though we take a-1, some of the b&#39;s from 1 to a-1 actually have b² &gt;a² +1? Let&#39;s check with higher a.Take a=10. a² +1=101. So b can be from 1 to 10. Let&#39;s check b=10: 10²=100 &lt;=101. So b=10 is allowed, but since a=10, b=10 is excluded. The other b&#39;s from 1 to 9: 1,4,9,...,81. All of these are &lt;=81 &lt;101. So indeed, all b&#39;s from 1 to 9 satisfy b² &lt;=101. So count is 9.Similarly, a=15: a² +1=225 +1=226. The maximum b allowed by the inequality is 15 (15²=225 &lt;=226). So b can be 1-15, excluding 15, so 1-14. Each of these b&#39;s squared is &lt;=225 &lt;=226. So yes, count is 14.Therefore, it seems that for all a from 1 to 20, the number of valid b&#39;s (b≠a, b² &lt;=a² +1) is a-1. Because for all b from 1 to a-1, their squares are at most (a-1)^2, and (a-1)^2 &lt;=a² +1?Wait, let&#39;s check if (a-1)^2 &lt;= a² +1.Compute (a - 1)^2 = a² - 2a +1. Compare to a² +1.So, a² -2a +1 &lt;=a² +1 ⇒ -2a &lt;=0 ⇒ a &gt;=0, which is always true since a is a natural number. So yes, (a -1)^2 &lt;=a² +1. Therefore, all b from 1 to a-1 satisfy b² &lt;= (a -1)^2 &lt;=a² +1. Therefore, the count of such b&#39;s is a -1. However, we must also check if a -1 is within the range 1 to 20. Since a ranges from 1 to 20, a -1 ranges from 0 to 19. But since b must be at least 1, for a=1, the count is 0, which is correct.Therefore, the number of valid b&#39;s for each a is a -1, but with the exception that if a -1 exceeds 20, but since a is up to 20, a -1 is 19, which is within the limit. However, wait, the original problem states that b is a natural number not greater than 20. So when a=20, the count is a -1=19, which is valid since b can be 1-19 (all &lt;=20). So no problem.Therefore, if this holds, then the total number of lines intersecting the circle is the sum over a=1 to 20 of (a -1). But wait, hold on! Because the problem states that a and b are different natural numbers not greater than 20. So for each a, we have to count the number of b&#39;s ≠a such that b² &lt;=a² +1. But according to the previous reasoning, if we have b&#39;s from 1 to a (excluding a), but only if b&#39;s from 1 to a -1 (since b≠a) satisfy b² &lt;=a² +1, which we saw that (a -1)^2 &lt;=a² +1. But in reality, the maximum b allowed by the inequality is floor(sqrt(a² +1)), which is a, as we saw. So for each a, the possible b&#39;s are 1 to a (excluding a). But since a can be up to 20, and b must be &lt;=20. Wait, but when a=20, sqrt(a² +1)≈20.01, so floor is 20. So for a=20, the maximum b is 20, but b≠20, so b=1-19. But for a=20, do all b=1-19 satisfy b² &lt;=20² +1=401?Yes, because 19²=361 &lt;=401, so yes. So for a=20, the count is 19. Similarly, for a=19, count is 18 (b=1-18, since b≠19), and 18²=324 &lt;=19² +1=362, yes.Therefore, for each a, the number of valid b&#39;s is a -1, because all b&#39;s from 1 to a -1 satisfy b² &lt;= (a -1)^2 &lt;=a² +1, and b=a is excluded. Therefore, the total number of lines is the sum from a=1 to 20 of (a -1). So sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1) = sum_{k=0}^{19} k = (19*20)/2 = 190.But wait, but hold on. Wait, does this hold for all a? Let me check with a specific example. Take a=5: the count is 4, as above, which is 5 -1=4. So for each a, the number is a -1, so total sum is 0 +1 +2 +...+19=190. But this seems too straightforward, and the problem is from a competition, likely requiring more nuanced thinking.But wait, according to our analysis, the count for each a is a -1, leading to a total of 190 lines. However, let&#39;s check with specific examples to see if this is correct.Take a=1: count=0. Correct, as no b≠1 with b² &lt;=2.a=2: count=1 (b=1). Correct, as 1²=1&lt;=5=2²+1.a=3: count=2 (b=1,2). 1²=1, 2²=4 &lt;=10=3²+1. Correct.a=4: count=3 (b=1,2,3). 1,4,9 &lt;=17=4²+1. Correct.a=5: count=4 (b=1-4). 1,4,9,16 &lt;=26=5²+1. Correct.Similarly, for a=20: count=19 (b=1-19). Each b² &lt;=20²+1=401, which is true since 19²=361 &lt;=401. Correct.Therefore, the total number of lines is 0 +1 +2 +...+19 = (19*20)/2 = 190. However, the problem says &quot;each pair of different natural numbers a and b&quot;, so maybe we need to consider that for each line, the pair (a, b) is considered, so for a and b different. But in our counting above, we considered for each a, the number of b&#39;s ≠a such that b² &lt;=a² +1. Therefore, each such pair (a, b) is unique. However, in the problem statement, Petya draws the line y=ax + b for each pair of different natural numbers a and b, so each (a, b) with a ≠b. Therefore, the total lines are 20*19=380, and the number of lines that intersect the circle is 190.But wait, this seems too straightforward, and the answer is 190. However, I have a feeling that this might not be correct. Let me double-check.Wait, suppose for a=1, count=0. For a=2, count=1. So total so far is 1.For a=3, count=2. Total 3.Continuing up to a=20, sum is 190. But let&#39;s take a concrete example. Take a=1. Then, the lines are y=1x + b where b=2 to 20. So 19 lines. None of them intersect the circle, since for a=1, all b=2 to 20: For each of these lines, the distance from the origin is |0 - 0 + b| / sqrt(1 + a²) = |b| / sqrt(2). The distance must be less than 1 for the line to intersect the circle. So |b| / sqrt(2) &lt;1 ⇒ |b| &lt; sqrt(2) ≈1.414. But b≥2, so all these lines are at a distance greater than sqrt(2) &gt;1, hence don&#39;t intersect. So count=0, which matches our previous result.For a=2, lines are y=2x + b, b=1,3,4,...,20. So 19 lines. How many of these intersect the circle?The distance from origin is |b| / sqrt(1 + 4) = |b| / sqrt(5). For intersection, need |b| / sqrt(5) &lt;1 ⇒ |b| &lt; sqrt(5)≈2.236. Since b is natural number, so b=1 or 2. But b≠a=2, so b=1. Therefore, only the line y=2x +1 intersects. So count=1, which matches our previous result.Similarly, for a=3, lines y=3x + b, b=1,2,4,...,20. Distance is |b| / sqrt(10). For intersection, |b| &lt; sqrt(10)≈3.162. So b=1,2,3. But b≠3, so b=1,2. So count=2. Correct.So in this way, the formula holds. For each a, the number of b&#39;s is the number of natural numbers b (≠a) such that |b| &lt; sqrt(a² +1). Since b is positive, this is equivalent to b &lt; sqrt(a² +1). Since sqrt(a² +1) is slightly larger than a, the maximum integer b satisfying b &lt; sqrt(a² +1) is a. But since b≠a, then b can be 1,2,...,a-1. Therefore, count is a -1. So total lines intersecting the circle is sum_{a=1}^{20} (a -1) =190.But wait, but in the problem statement, lines are drawn for all pairs of different a and b. So each line is uniquely determined by a and b with a≠b. However, in our analysis, we considered for each a, the number of b&#39;s less than a (i.e., b=1 to a-1), but we need to ensure that we&#39;re not double-counting lines where b &gt;a. For example, if we have a line y=3x +2, this corresponds to a=3, b=2. But if we have a line y=2x +3, this is a different line (a=2, b=3). So in our counting, for a=3, we count b=2, but for a=2, we count b=3 only if 3² &lt;=2² +1=5. But 3²=9&gt;5, so in that case, when a=2, b=3 is not counted. Therefore, there&#39;s no double-counting. Each line is considered once, either when a is larger or when b is larger, but only if the condition is met.Wait, actually, in our current counting, for each a, we are considering b &lt; sqrt(a² +1). Since sqrt(a² +1) is slightly larger than a, this means that for each a, we count the b&#39;s less than a, except in cases where b is slightly larger but still satisfies b² &lt;=a² +1. However, since sqrt(a² +1) &lt;a +1, as (a +1)^2 =a² +2a +1 &gt;a² +1, then the maximum integer b satisfying b² &lt;=a² +1 is a. Therefore, b must be &lt;=a, but since a and b are different, b can be at most a -1. Hence, our previous conclusion that for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a -1.But wait, but suppose a=2 and b=1: line y=2x +1 intersects the circle. But for a=1 and b=2: line y=1x +2, does this intersect the circle?Wait, earlier we saw that for a=1, all b=2 to 20 do not intersect, since their distance is |b| / sqrt(2) &gt;=2 /1.414≈1.414 &gt;1. Therefore, line y=x +2 doesn&#39;t intersect the circle.Similarly, line y=2x +1 intersects, but line y=1x +2 does not. Therefore, there is no overlap where a line is counted in both a and b. Hence, each intersection is counted exactly once in the sum.Therefore, the total number of intersecting lines is 190.But wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me check with another example.Take a=4. Then, the count is 3 (b=1,2,3). Each of these lines y=4x +1, y=4x +2, y=4x +3. Let&#39;s check if these lines intersect the circle.Compute the distance from the origin: |b| / sqrt(1 +16)= |b| /sqrt(17). For intersection, need |b| /sqrt(17) &lt;1 ⇒ |b| &lt;sqrt(17)≈4.123. So b=1,2,3,4. But b≠4, so b=1,2,3. So distance for b=1:1/sqrt(17)≈0.242 &lt;1 ⇒ intersects. Similarly for b=2,3: distances ≈0.485, 0.727, both &lt;1. So all three lines intersect. Correct.Similarly, take a=5. count=4 (b=1,2,3,4). Distance is |b| /sqrt(26). For b=1:≈0.196 &lt;1; b=2:≈0.392 &lt;1; b=3:≈0.588 &lt;1; b=4:≈0.784 &lt;1. All intersect. Correct.Similarly, for a=6: count=5 (b=1-5). Distance |b| /sqrt(37). sqrt(37)≈6.08. For b=5:5/6.08≈0.822 &lt;1. So yes.For a=10: count=9 (b=1-9). Distance for b=9:9/sqrt(101)≈9/10.05≈0.895 &lt;1. So intersects.For a=20: count=19 (b=1-19). Distance for b=19:19/sqrt(401)≈19/20.02≈0.949 &lt;1. So intersects.Therefore, our formula holds: for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a-1, and the total is 190.But wait, the problem statement says &quot;different natural numbers a and b, not greater than 20&quot;. So a and b must be different, but both a and b can be from 1 to 20. So for example, the line y=2x +1 is allowed (a=2, b=1), and y=1x +2 is allowed (a=1, b=2). But as we saw earlier, y=1x +2 does not intersect the circle, while y=2x +1 does. Therefore, in the total count of 190, we are counting all lines where a &gt; b, because for a &gt; b, b is from 1 to a-1, and these lines have a chance to intersect. But lines where a &lt; b would have b &gt;a, but then for such lines, when you fix b and consider a, the condition would be a² +1 &gt;=b². So if a &lt;b, but a² +1 &gt;=b², then such a line would also intersect. However, in our previous analysis, we only considered for each a, the number of b&#39;s less than a. But lines where a &lt;b but a² +1 &gt;=b² are not being counted in the sum. Wait, this is a crucial point.Wait, this is a mistake. The initial reasoning only counts for each a, the number of b&#39;s less than a (since we assumed that the maximum b is a). But actually, when a &lt;b, but a² +1 &gt;=b², such lines would also intersect the circle. Therefore, our previous count only considered the case where b &lt;a, but there may be cases where a &lt;b and still a² +1 &gt;=b². So we need to consider those as well. Therefore, our initial conclusion that the total is 190 is incorrect because we missed those lines where a &lt;b but a² +1 &gt;=b².For example, take a=1 and b=2: line y=1x +2. The discriminant condition is a² +1 =1 +1=2 &gt;=b²=4? No, 2 &lt;4. So this line does not intersect. Similarly, a=2 and b=3: check if 2² +1=5 &gt;=9? No. So line y=2x +3 doesn&#39;t intersect. But take a=3 and b=4: 3² +1=10 &gt;=16? No. a=4 and b=5: 4² +1=17 &gt;=25? No. So in general, for a &lt;b, a² +1 is less than b² when b &gt;=a +1. Let&#39;s check when a &lt;b and a² +1 &gt;=b². For natural numbers a, b:If a &lt;b, then a +1 &lt;=b. So a² +1 &gt;=b² ⇒ a² +1 &gt;=(a +1)^2 ⇒a² +1 &gt;=a² +2a +1 ⇒0 &gt;=2a ⇒a &lt;=0. But a is a natural number &gt;=1. Therefore, there are no solutions where a &lt;b and a² +1 &gt;=b². Therefore, the only lines that intersect the circle are those with a &gt;b, and in this case, the count for each a is a -1. Therefore, the total is indeed 190.Wait, this is a critical point. Let me verify it thoroughly.Suppose a and b are natural numbers with a &lt;b. We want to see if there exists any pair where a² +1 &gt;=b². Assume a &lt;b. Then b &gt;=a +1. Let&#39;s compute b² - (a² +1) &gt;= (a +1)^2 -a² -1 = 2a. Since a &gt;=1, 2a &gt;=2 &gt;0. Therefore, b² - (a² +1) &gt;=2 &gt;0. Hence, for any a &lt;b, we have b² &gt;a² +1. Therefore, in such cases, the line y=ax +b does not intersect the circle. Therefore, only lines where a &gt;b can possibly intersect the circle. And for those lines, the number is, as we computed, a -1 for each a. Hence, the total number is sum_{a=1}^{20}(a -1)=190.Therefore, the correct answer should be 190.But let me check with a specific example where a &lt;b. For example, a=1, b=1 is excluded. a=1, b=2: line y=x +2. Does this line intersect the circle?As above, the distance from the origin is |b| / sqrt(a² +1)=2 / sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)≈1.414 &gt;1. So it doesn&#39;t intersect. Similarly, a=2, b=3: distance |3| /sqrt(4 +1)=3/sqrt(5)≈1.342 &gt;1. Doesn&#39;t intersect. a=3, b=4: 4/sqrt(10)≈1.264 &gt;1. Still doesn&#39;t intersect. a=4, b=5:5/sqrt(17)≈1.213 &gt;1. Doesn&#39;t intersect. a=5, b=6:6/sqrt(26)≈1.177 &gt;1. Still doesn&#39;t intersect. Continuing, a=10, b=11:11/sqrt(101)≈11/10.05≈1.094 &gt;1. Doesn&#39;t intersect. a=19, b=20:20/sqrt(362)≈20/19.026≈1.051 &gt;1. Still doesn&#39;t intersect. So none of the lines with a &lt;b intersect the circle.Therefore, only the lines with a &gt;b can intersect, and their count is a -1 for each a. Hence, the total number is 190.Therefore, the answer is 190. However, the problem is from a competition, and the answer seems straightforward. Maybe I missed something. Let me verify once again.Alternative approach: The condition for the line y=ax +b to intersect the circle x² + y²=1 is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is less than or equal to 1.The distance from a point (x0,y0) to the line Ax + By + C=0 is |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). For the line y=ax +b, rewrite it as ax - y + b=0. Therefore, distance from (0,0) is |a*0 -1*0 +b| / sqrt(a² +1) = |b| / sqrt(a² +1). This must be &lt;1 for intersection (since the circle has radius 1, equality would mean tangent, which also counts as intersecting, but in the problem statement, Vasya drew a circle of radius 1, so the line is tangent if the distance is exactly 1, which should also be considered as intersecting. But in our discriminant approach earlier, tangent lines would result in D=0, which still counts as intersecting (a single point). However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s not specified whether tangent lines count as intersecting. But in usual geometry problems, tangents are considered intersecting. However, let&#39;s check with the discriminant method.If the distance is exactly 1, then |b| / sqrt(a² +1)=1 ⇒ |b|=sqrt(a² +1). Since b is a natural number, this implies sqrt(a² +1) is integer. Therefore, a² +1 must be a perfect square. But a² +1=k², which implies k² -a²=1 ⇒(k -a)(k +a)=1. Since k and a are natural numbers, the only solution is k -a=1 and k +a=1, but this implies 2a=0, which is impossible. Hence, there are no natural numbers a and k with a² +1=k². Therefore, there are no lines tangent to the circle. Therefore, all lines either intersect the circle at two points or don&#39;t intersect at all. Hence, the discriminant approach suffices.Therefore, using the distance formula, the condition is |b| &lt; sqrt(a² +1). Since b is natural, this is equivalent to b &lt; sqrt(a² +1). As sqrt(a² +1) is irrational for natural a (since a² +1 is not a perfect square), so floor(sqrt(a² +1))=a. Hence, b must be &lt;=a. But since a and b are different, b must be &lt;=a -1. Therefore, for each a, the number of b&#39;s is a -1. Hence, total lines 190.But let me confirm with another example. Take a=20: the lines are y=20x +1, y=20x +2, ..., y=20x +19. Each of these lines has distance |b| /sqrt(400 +1)=b/sqrt(401). The maximum b is 19:19/sqrt(401)≈19/20.02≈0.949 &lt;1. So all 19 lines intersect. Correct.Another example: a=10, b=9:9/sqrt(100 +1)=9/sqrt(101)≈0.895 &lt;1. Correct.Therefore, the answer is 190.But wait, I recall that in some combinatorial problems, when you have pairs (a,b) with a ≠b, sometimes you have to divide by 2 if you count both (a,b) and (b,a), but in this case, since the lines are different (y=ax +b and y=bx +a are different lines unless a=b), and we already considered only a &gt;b in our counting (by counting for each a, b &lt;a), and there&#39;s no overlap, then the total is indeed 190. Hence, the answer is 190.Final Answerboxed{190}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many of Petya&#39;s lines intersect Vasya&#39;s circle, we need to check if the line ( y = ax + b ) intersects the circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ). This is done by checking the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by substituting ( y = ax + b ) into the circle&#39;s equation.1.

Excluding ( b = a ), valid ( b ) are 1 to ( a - 1 ).4. Sum the counts for each ( a ):   - For each ( a ), the number of valid ( b ) is ( a - 1 ).   - Total count is the sum of ( a - 1 ) for ( a ) from 1 to 20:   [   sum_{a=1}^{20} (a - 1) = sum_{k=0}^{19} k = frac{19 cdot 20}{2} = 190   ]Thus, the number of lines that intersect the circle is (boxed{190}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb740fc7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>🔑:</span>Answer: 190.

Hmm, I remember that the angle between two planes is related to their normal vectors. Let me think. Each plane has a normal vector, right? The coefficients of x, y, and z in the plane equation give the components of the normal vector. So for the first plane, x + 2y + 2z - 3 = 0, the normal vector would be (1, 2, 2). And for the second plane, 2x - y + 2z + 5 = 0, the normal vector is (2, -1, 2). Now, the angle between the two planes is the same as the angle between their normal vectors. Wait, is that correct? Or is it the supplement of that angle? Let me recall. If the normals are pointing in certain directions, the angle between the planes could be acute or obtuse, but I think the formula uses the acute angle between the normals. Let me confirm. The angle θ between the two planes is given by the formula:cosθ = |(n1 • n2)| / (|n1| |n2|)Where n1 and n2 are the normal vectors. The absolute value is taken because the angle between two planes is considered to be the acute one. So even if the dot product is negative, taking the absolute value ensures we get the acute angle. Got it.So first, let&#39;s compute the dot product of the two normal vectors. The normal vectors are (1, 2, 2) and (2, -1, 2). The dot product is (1)(2) + (2)(-1) + (2)(2) = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4. Next, compute the magnitudes of each normal vector. For the first normal vector (1, 2, 2), the magnitude is sqrt(1² + 2² + 2²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. For the second normal vector (2, -1, 2), the magnitude is sqrt(2² + (-1)² + 2²) = sqrt(4 + 1 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. So putting these into the formula, cosθ = |4| / (3 * 3) = 4 / 9. Then θ is the arccos of 4/9. Let me check if this is in radians or degrees. The problem doesn&#39;t specify, but since it&#39;s a geometry problem, degrees might be more intuitive. Let me compute this value. But wait, maybe I can leave it in terms of inverse cosine. Alternatively, if they need a numerical value, but perhaps just expressing it as arccos(4/9) is acceptable. Let me see. The problem says &quot;Find the angle,&quot; so maybe they expect an exact value. Hmm, but arccos(4/9) isn&#39;t a standard angle, so probably they just want the expression in terms of inverse cosine. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator to find the approximate degree measure. Let me check both.First, let&#39;s compute the angle in radians. Arccos(4/9) is approximately... Well, 4 divided by 9 is approximately 0.4444. The arccos of 0.4444 is approximately 1.110 radians. To convert that to degrees, multiply by 180/pi: 1.110 * (180/3.1416) ≈ 63.7 degrees. So approximately 63.7 degrees. But since the problem may require an exact answer, perhaps they want it in terms of arccos(4/9). Let me check the problem statement again.The problem says &quot;Find the angle between the planes,&quot; and under &quot;Task Condition,&quot; there&#39;s no specific instruction on the form of the answer. But in math problems like this, unless specified, sometimes they prefer the exact measure in terms of inverse cosine, or maybe they want the acute angle, which this is. Let me verify if there&#39;s a mistake in my calculation.Wait, hold on. Let me recheck the dot product. For the first normal vector (1,2,2) and second (2,-1,2). The dot product is (1)(2) + (2)(-1) + (2)(2). So 2 - 2 + 4. That&#39;s 4, correct. The magnitudes are both 3. So 4/9. Correct. So cosθ = 4/9. Therefore, θ = arccos(4/9). So that&#39;s the answer. But just to be thorough, let me think again.Alternatively, sometimes the angle between planes is defined as the angle between their normals, but sometimes people consider the angle between the planes themselves, which is supplementary if the normals&#39; angle is obtuse. Wait, but in this case, the angle between normals is arccos(4/9), which is approximately 63.7 degrees, acute. So the angle between the planes is the same, right? Because if the normals are at an acute angle, the planes themselves form the same acute angle. If the normals were at an obtuse angle, then the angle between the planes would be the supplement. But since we take the absolute value in the formula, we always get the acute angle. Let me verify this with a reference.Yes, according to sources, the angle between two planes is defined as the angle between their normals, and it&#39;s the acute angle. So if the dot product formula gives an acute angle, that&#39;s the answer. If it gives an obtuse angle, you take the supplement. But since we take the absolute value of the dot product, we always get the acute angle. Therefore, arccos(4/9) is indeed the angle between the two planes.So my conclusion is that the angle between the planes is arccos(4/9). If the problem expects a numerical answer, then approximately 63.7 degrees. But since mathematical answers often prefer exact forms, especially when it&#39;s not a standard angle, I think writing arccos(4/9) is acceptable. However, let me check the problem&#39;s task condition again. It says &quot;Find the angle between the planes,&quot; and to put the final answer in a box. Since they didn&#39;t specify, but in many textbooks, the angle between planes is expressed in degrees with inverse cosine. Alternatively, it&#39;s possible that 4/9 is a fraction that can be simplified, but 4 and 9 are coprime, so 4/9 is simplest. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let me confirm once again.Alternatively, if I use the formula:The angle θ between two planes with normals n1 and n2 is given by:cosθ = |n1 • n2| / (|n1| |n2|)Which is exactly what I did. Therefore, θ = arccos(4/9). Therefore, this is the correct answer.Therefore, the angle between the two planes is arccos(4/9), which can be written as boxed notation.Alternatively, if they want the answer in degrees, but since 4/9 is not a standard cosine value, maybe just leave it in terms of arccos. So the answer is arccos(4/9). Alternatively, maybe they want the answer in radians? But unless specified, either is acceptable. However, in the absence of specific instructions, I think it&#39;s safer to present the exact expression.Thus, the angle between the planes is arccos(4/9). So boxed, that would be boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}.But let me check once again if I computed the dot product and magnitudes correctly.First normal vector: (1,2,2). Second normal vector: (2,-1,2).Dot product: 1*2 + 2*(-1) + 2*2 = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4. Correct.|n1| = sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. Correct.|n2| = sqrt(4 + 1 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. Correct.Thus, 4/(3*3) = 4/9. So arccos(4/9) is correct.Therefore, the answer is boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}.Alternatively, if they want degrees, but unless specified, exact form is better. So I think that&#39;s the right answer.Final AnswerThe angle between the planes is boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the angle between the planes given by the equations (x + 2y + 2z - 3 = 0) and (2x - y + 2z + 5 = 0), we start by identifying the normal vectors of each plane. The normal vector for the first plane is ((1, 2, 2)) and for the second plane is ((2, -1, 2)).The angle (theta) between the planes is determined by the angle between their normal vectors. This can be found using the dot product formula:[costheta = frac{|mathbf{n_1} cdot mathbf{n_2}|}{|mathbf{n_1}| |mathbf{n_2}|}]First, compute the dot product of the normal vectors:[mathbf{n_1} cdot mathbf{n_2} = (1)(2) + (2)(-1) + (2)(2) = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4]Next, compute the magnitudes of the normal vectors:[|mathbf{n_1}| = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 4} = sqrt{9} = 3][|mathbf{n_2}| = sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{4 + 1 + 4} = sqrt{9} = 3]Substitute these values into the formula:[costheta = frac{|4|}{3 times 3} = frac{4}{9}]Thus, the angle (theta) is:[theta = arccosleft(frac{4}{9}right)]The final answer is (boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the angle between two planes given by the equations x + 2y + 2z - 3 = 0 and 2x - y + 2z + 5 = 0. Hmm, I remember that the angle between two planes is related to their normal vectors. Let me recall the exact method.First, each plane has a normal vector which can be read directly from the coefficients of x, y, and z in the equation. For the first plane, x + 2y + 2z - 3 = 0, the normal vector should be (1, 2, 2). Similarly, the second plane is 2x - y + 2z + 5 = 0, so its normal vector is (2, -1, 2). Right, that seems straightforward.Now, the angle between the two planes is the same as the angle between their normal vectors. Wait, or is it the supplement of that angle? Let me think. If the normals form an acute angle, does that mean the planes themselves form the same acute angle, or the obtuse one? I think it&#39;s the acute angle between the normals that gives the angle between the planes. Because the angle between two planes is defined as the smallest angle between them. So, even if the normals form an obtuse angle, we take the acute angle between the planes. Therefore, the angle θ between the planes is equal to the angle between their normals, which can be found using the dot product formula.The formula for the angle between two vectors is the dot product of the vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes, right? So, cosθ = (n1 · n2) / (|n1| |n2|). Then θ is the arccosine of that value. Let me verify that. Yes, that sounds correct. So, I need to compute the dot product of the two normal vectors, divide by the product of their magnitudes, and take the inverse cosine to find the angle.Let me compute the dot product first. The normal vectors are n1 = (1, 2, 2) and n2 = (2, -1, 2). The dot product is (1)(2) + (2)(-1) + (2)(2) = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4. Okay, the dot product is 4.Next, find the magnitudes of each normal vector. For n1: |n1| = sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. For n2: |n2| = sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(4 + 1 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. So both have magnitude 3.Therefore, cosθ = 4 / (3 * 3) = 4/9. Then θ = arccos(4/9). Let me compute that. I know that arccos(4/9) is an angle in radians or degrees. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but angles in geometry problems are often expected in degrees unless stated otherwise. However, maybe they just want the exact value. Let me check the question again. It says &quot;Find the angle between the planes,&quot; so probably just express it as arccos(4/9), but maybe it&#39;s a standard angle. Let me compute 4/9. That&#39;s approximately 0.444. The arccos of 0.444 is approximately 63.6 degrees. Wait, but is there a better way to represent this?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a way to rationalize or express the angle in terms of inverse trigonometric functions. But unless 4/9 is a known cosine value, which I don&#39;t think it is, we just have to leave it as arccos(4/9). However, the problem might expect the answer in a particular form. Let me check the task conditions again. It just says &quot;Find the angle between the planes,&quot; so likely either exact value in terms of inverse cosine or a decimal approximation. But given that the coefficients are integers and the result is 4/9, which is a neat fraction, probably leave it as arccos(4/9). However, sometimes in math problems, especially with planes, they might prefer the answer in degrees. Wait, but without a calculator, I can&#39;t compute the exact degree measure, so maybe the answer is just arccos(4/9). But let me verify once more.Alternatively, maybe the angle between the planes can also be found using the formula involving the sine of the angle between the normals? Wait, no. Wait, the angle between the planes is defined as the angle between their normals. Wait, actually, I might be confused here. Let me confirm this.Actually, the angle between two planes is equal to the angle between their normals if it&#39;s acute, or 180 minus that angle if it&#39;s obtuse. But we always take the acute angle between the two planes. So, the angle θ between the planes is the acute angle between the normals. So, if the angle calculated from the dot product is acute, that&#39;s the answer; if it&#39;s obtuse, subtract it from 180. However, since the dot product formula gives the smallest angle between the vectors, which could be acute or obtuse depending on the direction. Wait, actually, the formula gives the angle between 0 and 180, but depending on the orientation. Wait, but the angle between two planes is defined as the smallest angle between them, which is acute or right. Therefore, we take the acute angle between the normals. But the formula using the dot product gives the angle between the normals, so if that angle is acute, then that&#39;s the angle between the planes. If it&#39;s obtuse, then the angle between the planes is 180 minus that. Wait, but the angle between two planes is always considered to be between 0 and 180 degrees, but when people refer to &quot;the angle between two planes,&quot; they usually take the smallest one. So, perhaps the angle between the normals is either equal to the angle between the planes or its supplement, depending on which is acute.Wait, maybe to avoid confusion, the angle between two planes is defined as the angle between their normals, but measured between 0 and 90 degrees. Therefore, if the angle calculated from the normals is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees), we take its supplement to get the acute angle between the planes. Therefore, in that case, θ = arccos(|n1 · n2| / (|n1||n2|)). Wait, that&#39;s another formula I might have heard. So, maybe the correct formula is to take the absolute value of the dot product divided by the product of magnitudes, so that the angle is forced to be acute. Let me check.Yes, actually, upon reflection, the angle between two planes is defined as the acute angle between them. Therefore, even if the normals form an obtuse angle, the angle between the planes is the acute angle. Therefore, the formula is cosθ = |n1 · n2| / (|n1| |n2|). Therefore, in this case, since the dot product is positive (4/9), the angle is acute, so θ = arccos(4/9). However, if the dot product was negative, we would take the absolute value to get the acute angle.But in this problem, since the dot product is positive (4), the angle between the normals is acute, so the angle between the planes is the same as the angle between the normals, which is arccos(4/9). Therefore, the answer is arccos(4/9), which can also be written in terms of inverse cosine. Alternatively, if they want a numerical value, we can approximate it. Let me see.But since the problem is presented in a mathematical context without specifying to approximate, the answer should be left in terms of arccos(4/9). However, I should check if arccos(4/9) can be simplified or if there&#39;s a better way to present it. Alternatively, maybe the answer is supposed to be in degrees. Let me compute it approximately. 4 divided by 9 is approximately 0.444. The arccos of 0.444 is approximately 63.6 degrees. So, approximately 63.6 degrees.But since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, not a decimal approximation, we should present it as arccos(4/9). Alternatively, if they want it in radians, but again, unless specified, probably in terms of inverse cosine. However, in some textbooks, angles between planes are given in degrees. Let me check if 4/9 corresponds to a standard angle. Hmm, 4/9 is approximately 0.444. The cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5, which is larger, and cosine of 45 degrees is about 0.707. Wait, no, cosine decreases as the angle increases. So, cos 60° = 0.5, cos 90° = 0. So, 0.444 is between 60° and 90°, closer to 60°. The exact value is arccos(4/9). So, probably the answer is arccos(4/9), or in a more simplified radical form if possible, but since 4/9 is already simplified, that&#39;s the answer.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let me verify the calculation once again.First normal vector: (1, 2, 2), second normal vector: (2, -1, 2). Dot product: 1*2 + 2*(-1) + 2*2 = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4. The magnitudes: sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = 3, sqrt(4 + 1 + 4) = 3. So, 4/(3*3) = 4/9. So, yes, that&#39;s correct. So, arccos(4/9) is the angle between the normals, and since it&#39;s acute, that&#39;s the angle between the planes. Therefore, the answer is arccos(4/9).Alternatively, sometimes problems expect the answer in degrees, so if we compute it numerically, as I did before, approximately 63.6 degrees. But unless specified, the exact value is better. So, in a math competition or homework, arccos(4/9) would be acceptable, but sometimes they might want it in terms of π or something, but 4/9 is not a standard angle. So, I think the answer is arccos(4/9), which can be boxed as boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in degrees, but since it&#39;s not specified, the exact expression is better. Let me check one more time.Yes, according to standard procedure, the angle between two planes is found by taking the arccosine of the absolute value of the dot product of the normals divided by the product of their magnitudes. Since here, the dot product is positive, the absolute value doesn&#39;t change anything. So, θ = arccos(4/9). Therefore, that&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerThe angle between the planes is boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the angle between the planes given by the equations (x + 2y + 2z - 3 = 0) and (2x - y + 2z + 5 = 0), we start by identifying the normal vectors of each plane. The normal vector for the first plane is (mathbf{n_1} = (1, 2, 2)) and for the second plane is (mathbf{n_2} = (2, -1, 2)).The angle (theta) between the planes is the same as the acute angle between their normal vectors. This can be found using the dot product formula:[costheta = frac{mathbf{n_1} cdot mathbf{n_2}}{|mathbf{n_1}| |mathbf{n_2}|}]First, we calculate the dot product of the normal vectors:[mathbf{n_1} cdot mathbf{n_2} = (1)(2) + (2)(-1) + (2)(2) = 2 - 2 + 4 = 4]Next, we find the magnitudes of the normal vectors:[|mathbf{n_1}| = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 4} = sqrt{9} = 3][|mathbf{n_2}| = sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{4 + 1 + 4} = sqrt{9} = 3]Substituting these values into the formula for (costheta):[costheta = frac{4}{3 times 3} = frac{4}{9}]Thus, the angle (theta) between the planes is:[theta = arccosleft(frac{4}{9}right)]The final answer is (boxed{arccosleft(dfrac{4}{9}right)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb740fc7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>🔑:</span>## SolutionThe dihedral angle between planes is equal to the angle between their normal vectors.

Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem.First, the equation is (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n. Both sides are positive integers since x, y, m, n are positive integers. Also, m and n must be coprime. So, my goal is to find all triples (n, x, y) where x and y are positive integers, n is a positive integer coprime with m, and the equation holds.Let me think about the exponents here. The left side is (x² + y²) raised to the power m, and the right side is (xy) raised to the power n. Since m and n are coprime, maybe that plays a role in how the exponents relate. Also, since x and y are positive integers, x² + y² and xy are also positive integers.I wonder if I can express x and y in terms of some common base or use prime factorization. Let me try to analyze the equation.First, take both sides as products. Let&#39;s write the equation as:(x² + y²)^m = x^n y^n.So, x² + y² and xy are related through exponents m and n. Since m and n are coprime, maybe x² + y² and xy must both be perfect powers? Wait, but m and n are exponents here, so perhaps x² + y² is a perfect n-th power, and xy is a perfect m-th power? But since m and n are coprime, maybe there&#39;s a common base?Alternatively, maybe I can set x² + y² = k^n and xy = k^m for some integer k? But then, the equation would hold if k^n raised to m equals k^m raised to n, but that&#39;s k^{mn} = k^{mn}, which is always true. But that seems too vague. Let me think again.Alternatively, perhaps x² + y² = a^m and xy = a^n, but then a^m would equal (xy)^{n/m}, but since m and n are coprime, m divides n? But m and n are coprime, so m must be 1. Wait, that might not hold. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t right.Wait, perhaps taking prime factors. Let me consider the prime factorization of both sides. Let p be a prime that divides x or y. Suppose p divides x. Then, p divides the right-hand side (xy)^n, so p divides the left-hand side (x² + y²)^m. Therefore, p divides x² + y². Since p divides x, then p divides y², hence p divides y. Similarly, if a prime divides y, it must divide x. Therefore, x and y must have the same prime factors. So, x and y are both multiples of some common integer. Let&#39;s say d is the greatest common divisor of x and y. Then, we can write x = d * a, y = d * b, where a and b are coprime positive integers. Then, substituting back into the equation:(d²a² + d²b²)^m = (d * a * d * b)^n(d²(a² + b²))^m = (d²ab)^nd^{2m}(a² + b²)^m = d^{2n}(ab)^nDivide both sides by d^{2m} (assuming d ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t since x and y are positive integers):(a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^nNow, since a and b are coprime, and a² + b² and ab might have some common factors. Wait, since a and b are coprime, ab is coprime with a² + b². Let me check that. Suppose a prime p divides ab and a² + b². Then p divides a or p divides b. Suppose p divides a. Then since p divides a² + b², it must divide b², hence p divides b. But a and b are coprime, so p cannot divide both. Similarly, if p divides b, same contradiction. Therefore, ab and a² + b² are coprime. Therefore, in the equation (a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n, the left-hand side and the right-hand side are both products of coprime factors. Therefore, each factor must be a perfect power.Since (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n are coprime. Therefore, their product (if they were multiplied) would have factors from each, but in this case, the equation is (a² + b²)^m equals d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n. Therefore, since (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n are coprime, then d^{2(n - m)} must be 1. Because otherwise, the right-hand side would have a common factor with the left-hand side? Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps each prime factor in d must divide either (a² + b²) or (ab), but since (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, d must be 1. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.Wait, since (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n are coprime, the only way that their product (if they were multiplied) would have common factors is if they share a common factor, which they don&#39;t. But in our case, the right-hand side is d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n. So, for the equality to hold, since the left-hand side is (a² + b²)^m and the right-hand side is d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n, and the two sides must be equal, then the prime factors of both sides must match.Given that (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, each prime factor on the left side must be in (a² + b²), and each prime factor on the right side must be in ab or in d. However, since a and b are coprime, ab is square-free? Wait, not necessarily. ab can have exponents, but since a and b are coprime, the exponents of primes in ab are the sum of exponents in a and b.But given that (a² + b²)^m is equal to d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n, and (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then (a² + b²)^m must equal d^{2(n - m)}, and (ab)^n must equal 1. But (ab)^n equals 1 only if ab=1. So, ab=1 implies that a=1 and b=1. Then, substituting back, (1² + 1²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(1*1)^n =&gt; (2)^m = d^{2(n - m)}. So 2^m is a perfect 2(n - m)th power. Therefore, 2(n - m) must divide m. Let&#39;s write m = k * 2(n - m), but since m and n are coprime, this might be restrictive.Wait, but if ab=1, then a=1 and b=1. Therefore, x = d*1 = d, y = d*1 = d. So x = y = d. Then, substituting back into the original equation: (d² + d²)^m = (d * d)^n =&gt; (2d²)^m = d^{2n} =&gt; 2^m d^{2m} = d^{2n} =&gt; 2^m = d^{2(n - m)}. Therefore, d^{2(n - m)} = 2^m. Since d is a positive integer, the right side is 2^m, so d must be a power of 2. Let d = 2^k. Then, (2^k)^{2(n - m)} = 2^{2k(n - m)} = 2^m. Therefore, exponents must be equal: 2k(n - m) = m. So, 2k(n - m) = m. Since m and n are coprime, let&#39;s see.We have 2k(n - m) = m. Let&#39;s rearrange: 2k n = m(2k + 1). Therefore, m divides 2k n. But since m and n are coprime, m divides 2k. Let me write m as m = 2k / t, where t is a divisor of 2k. Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Let&#39;s try plugging back.We have 2k(n - m) = m, so 2kn - 2km = m =&gt; 2kn = m(2k + 1). Therefore, m divides 2kn. Since gcd(m, n) = 1, m divides 2k. Let me write 2k = m * s for some integer s. Then substituting back:2kn = m(2k + 1) =&gt; (m * s) n = m (m * s + 1) =&gt; s n = m s + 1 =&gt; s(n - m) = 1.Since s and (n - m) are integers, the only solution is s=1 and n - m=1. Therefore, s=1 implies 2k = m * 1 =&gt; m = 2k. Then, n - m =1 =&gt; n = m +1. So, m = 2k, n = 2k +1. Therefore, m is even, and n is m +1. Since m and n must be coprime, check if m=2k and n=2k+1 are coprime. Yes, because consecutive integers are coprime. For example, m=2, n=3; m=4, n=5; etc. So, in this case, the solutions would be m=2k, n=2k+1, and d=2^k. Therefore, x = y = d = 2^k. So, substituting back, x = y = 2^k, m=2k, n=2k+1. So for each positive integer k, we have a solution (n, x, y) = (2k+1, 2^k, 2^k). But wait, m is given. Wait, the problem states: &quot;For a given positive integer m, find all positive integer triples (n, x, y), where m, n are coprime, and satisfy...&quot; So m is given, and we need to find n, x, y. So, if m is even, say m=2k, then n=2k+1, x=y=2^k. If m is odd, then this approach gives no solution, because m=2k would require m even. Therefore, in this case, if m is even, then there is a solution with n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}. Wait, but if m is even, say m=2k, then 2^{m/2}=2^k. So, yes. So, for even m, there is a solution where x=y=2^{m/2}, n=m+1. But we need to check whether m and n are coprime. Since n=m+1, and m=2k, n=2k+1. Since 2k and 2k+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So yes, gcd(m, n)=1. Therefore, when m is even, such a solution exists. But what if m is odd? Then, according to this, there&#39;s no solution from this family. But maybe there are other solutions where ab is not 1?Wait, earlier I assumed that (a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n, and since (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then both (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n must be equal to d^{2(n - m)} and 1, respectively. But that led us to ab=1. However, perhaps there&#39;s another approach. Maybe the exponents must satisfy some conditions?Alternatively, since (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n must be equal up to a factor of d^{2(n - m)}, which complicates things. Wait, perhaps d must be 1. If d=1, then (a² + b²)^m = (ab)^n. So in that case, x and y are a and b, which are coprime. So maybe the only solutions are when x and y are coprime, and (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n. So if x and y are coprime, then similar to before, x² + y² and xy are coprime. Wait, but x and y are coprime, so x² and y² are coprime, so x² + y² and xy would share a common divisor? Let me check. Suppose p is a prime dividing both x² + y² and xy. Then p divides x or y. If p divides x, then p divides x² + y², so p divides y², hence p divides y, contradicting that x and y are coprime. Similarly for y. Therefore, x² + y² and xy are coprime. Therefore, (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n implies that both sides must be 1. But since x and y are positive integers, the only way this can happen is if x² + y²=1 and xy=1. But the only positive integers x and y with xy=1 are x=y=1, but then x² + y²=2 ≠1. Therefore, there are no solutions with d=1 except when... Hmm, this suggests that the only solutions are those where d&gt;1, but we considered d&gt;1 earlier and found solutions when m is even. But maybe there are other solutions where d&gt;1 but ab ≠1. However, in that case, we would have (a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n. Since a and b are coprime, but ab can be greater than 1. However, since (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then each must be a perfect power. Let me think.If (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then (a² + b²)^m must be a perfect n-th power, and (ab)^n must be a perfect m-th power. Since m and n are coprime, this would imply that both (a² + b²) and ab must be perfect (mn)-th powers? Wait, because if (a² + b²)^m is an n-th power, then since m and n are coprime, (a² + b²) must be a perfect n-th power. Similarly, (ab)^n is an m-th power, so since m and n are coprime, ab must be a perfect m-th power.Therefore, since (a² + b²) is a perfect n-th power and ab is a perfect m-th power, and a and b are coprime, then a and b must themselves be m-th powers. Because since ab is a perfect m-th power and a and b are coprime, then a and b are each m-th powers. Let me write a = c^m, b = d^m, where c and d are coprime positive integers. Then, ab = c^m d^m = (cd)^m, which is a perfect m-th power. Then, a² + b² = c^{2m} + d^{2m} must be a perfect n-th power. So, we have c^{2m} + d^{2m} = e^n for some positive integer e.Therefore, the equation reduces to finding coprime positive integers c, d, and a positive integer e such that c^{2m} + d^{2m} = e^n. Then, the solutions (n, x, y) would be n, x = c^m * d, y = d^m * d? Wait, no. Wait, originally, we set x = d * a, y = d * b, where a = c^m, b = d^m. Wait, hold on, maybe there was confusion here.Wait, earlier, we set x = d * a, y = d * b, with a and b coprime. Then, we found that (a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n. Then, considering that x and y are coprime (if d=1), but if d&gt;1, then x and y share a common factor d. However, in the case where d&gt;1, we proceeded to set a=1 and b=1 because we thought ab must be 1, but that led to solutions only when m is even.But now, considering that if we have (a² + b²)^m and (ab)^n, with (a² + b²) and ab coprime, perhaps they must each be a power of the same base? Wait, but since they are coprime, the only way their powers can be equal is if both are 1. Which would lead to a=1, b=1, but that only gives the trivial equation 2^m = 1, which only holds if m=0, which is not positive. So perhaps the only solutions are when d&gt;1?Wait, perhaps my initial approach was correct. So, if d&gt;1, then the equation (a² + b²)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n. But since a and b are coprime, and (a² + b²) and ab are coprime, then each side must be a product of coprime factors. Therefore, (a² + b²)^m must equal d^{2(n - m)} and (ab)^n must equal 1. But (ab)^n =1 implies ab=1, hence a=1, b=1. Therefore, in this case, x = d*1 = d, y = d*1 = d. Then, the equation becomes (2d²)^m = (d²)^n =&gt; 2^m d^{2m} = d^{2n} =&gt; 2^m = d^{2(n - m)}. So, d must be a power of 2, as before. Then, d=2^k, so 2^m = (2^k)^{2(n - m)} = 2^{2k(n - m)}. Therefore, m = 2k(n - m). Then, m must be even. Let m=2t. Then, 2t = 2k(n - 2t) =&gt; t = k(n - 2t). Therefore, t = k(n - 2t). Let&#39;s rearrange: t + 2kt = kn =&gt; t(1 + 2k) = kn. Hence, kn = t(1 + 2k). Therefore, k divides t(1 + 2k). Since k and 1 + 2k are coprime (since gcd(k, 1 + 2k) = gcd(k,1)=1), k divides t. Let t = k s. Then, substituting:kn = k s (1 + 2k) =&gt; n = s(1 + 2k).Since m and n must be coprime, m=2t=2k s, and n = s(1 + 2k). Therefore, gcd(2k s, s(1 + 2k)) = s gcd(2k, 1 + 2k). Since gcd(2k, 1 + 2k) = gcd(2k,1)=1. Therefore, gcd(m,n)=s. But m and n must be coprime, so s=1.Therefore, s=1. Hence, t = k*1 = k, and n = 1*(1 + 2k) = 1 + 2k. Since m=2k s=2k*1=2k, so m=2k and n=1 + 2k. Therefore, m must be even, n=m +1, and d=2^k. Therefore, x = y = d=2^k. So, in this case, the solutions are x=y=2^{m/2}, n=m+1, where m is even.Thus, for even m, there exists a solution with n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}. For odd m, there are no solutions in this family. But maybe there are other solutions where a and b are not 1? Wait, earlier I considered that if d=1, then we have (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n with x and y coprime. But then, as we saw, x and y coprime implies x² + y² and xy are coprime, so both must be 1, which is impossible. So, only solutions are when d&gt;1, leading to x=y=d=2^{m/2}, n=m+1, but only when m is even. Therefore, the conclusion is that solutions exist only when m is even, and in that case, n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}. However, we need to check if there are other solutions where a and b are not 1. For example, maybe x≠y?Wait, let&#39;s suppose that x≠y. Let me try small values of m and see if there are solutions. Let&#39;s take m=1. Then, the equation is (x² + y²)^1 = (xy)^n. So, x² + y² = (xy)^n. Since m=1 and n must be coprime with 1, which is always true. Let&#39;s find positive integers x,y,n such that x² + y² = (xy)^n. Let&#39;s try n=2: x² + y² = (xy)^2. For x,y ≥1. Let x=1, y=1: 1+1=1, no. x=1, y=2: 1 +4=4 → 5=4, no. x=2, y=2: 8=16, no. x=1, y=3: 1+9=9, nope. Maybe n=3: x² + y² = (xy)^3. Let x=1, y=1: 2=1, no. x=1, y=2: 1+4=8 →5=8, no. x=2, y=2: 8=64, no. Not promising. Maybe n=1: x² + y² = xy. But x² + y² ≥ 2xy ≥ xy, equality only if x=y=0, which isn&#39;t allowed. So, for m=1, no solutions.Similarly, m=2. Let&#39;s see. Then, n must be coprime with 2, so n must be odd. The equation is (x² + y²)^2 = (xy)^n. From our earlier analysis, if m=2 (even), then n=3, x=y=2^{2/2}=2. Let&#39;s check: (2² + 2²)^2 = (8)^2=64. (2*2)^3=4^3=64. Yes, works. Are there other solutions? Let&#39;s try n=1: (x² + y²)^2 = xy. Left side is at least (1 +1)^2=4, right side is at least 1. For x,y≥1, equality possible? If x=1,y=1: 4=1, no. x=2,y=2: 16=4, no. Doesn&#39;t work. n=3: Let&#39;s see if there are other solutions. Let x=1, y=k: (1 + k²)^2 = (k)^3. So, (k² +1)^2 = k^3. Let&#39;s try k=1: 4=1, no. k=2: 25=8, no. k=3: 100=27, no. k=5: 26²=676 vs 125, no. Doesn&#39;t seem to work. Maybe x and y different. Suppose x=2, y=4: (4 + 16)^2 = 400. (8)^3=512. Not equal. x=1, y=2: (1 +4)^2=25 vs 8. No. So, only solution when x=y=2, n=3. So that&#39;s the solution we found earlier.Similarly, for m=4, which is even. Then, n=5, x=y=2^{4/2}=4. Check: (16 +16)^4 = (32)^4. (4*4)^5=16^5. 32^4 = (2^5)^4 = 2^{20}. 16^5 = (2^4)^5 = 2^{20}. So, yes, equal. So that works. Are there other solutions for m=4? Let&#39;s try x=1, y=1: (1 +1)^4=16 vs 1^5=1. No. x=2, y=2: 8^4=4096 vs 4^5=1024. No. So only solution is x=y=4, n=5.Therefore, it seems that when m is even, the only solution is n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}. When m is odd, perhaps no solutions. Let&#39;s test m=3. Then n must be coprime with 3. Let&#39;s try n=2 (gcd(3,2)=1). The equation is (x² + y²)^3 = (xy)^2. Let&#39;s see if there are any solutions. Let x=1, y=1: 8=1, no. x=1, y=2: (1 +4)^3=125 vs 2^2=4, no. x=2, y=2: (4 +4)^3=512 vs 16, no. x=1, y=3: (1 +9)^3=1000 vs 9, no. x=2, y=4: (4 +16)^3=8000 vs 64, no. Doesn&#39;t seem possible. What about n=4 (gcd(3,4)=1). Then equation is (x² + y²)^3=(xy)^4. Trying x=2,y=2: (8)^3=512 vs (4)^4=256, no. x=4,y=4: (32)^3=32768 vs (16)^4=65536, no. x=1,y=1: 8=1, no. Doesn&#39;t work. So, no solutions for m=3.Similarly, m=5. Then n must be coprime with 5. Let&#39;s try n=2: (x² + y²)^5=(xy)^2. x=1,y=1: 32=1, no. x=2,y=2: 32^5 vs 16, no. Not possible. So, seems like when m is odd, there are no solutions.Therefore, the only solutions occur when m is even, with n=m+1 and x=y=2^{m/2}. So, for a given even m, set n=m+1 and x=y=2^{m/2}. For odd m, there are no solutions.Wait, but the problem says &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, so depending on m being even or odd, the answer varies. The problem is asking for all triples (n, x, y) with m and n coprime. Therefore, the answer would be: if m is even, then the only solution is n=m+1 and x=y=2^{m/2}; if m is odd, there are no solutions. But let&#39;s check m=2. If m=2, then n=3, x=y=2. Then, check gcd(m,n)=gcd(2,3)=1, which holds. Similarly, m=4, n=5, gcd(4,5)=1. So yes, this works.But wait, is this the only solution? Suppose m=6, which is even. Then n=7, x=y=2^{3}=8. Let&#39;s check: (8² +8²)^6 = (128)^6. (8*8)^7 = (64)^7. 128^6 = (2^7)^6 = 2^{42}; 64^7 = (2^6)^7 = 2^{42}. Equal, so it works. So, seems consistent.But what if there&#39;s another solution where x≠y? Suppose m=2, n=3. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a solution with x≠y. Let&#39;s suppose x=1, y=2. Then, (1 +4)^2=25 vs (1*2)^3=8. Not equal. x=2, y=4: (4 +16)^2=400 vs (8)^3=512. No. x=1, y=3: (1 +9)^2=100 vs (3)^3=27. No. So, no other solutions here. What about x= sqrt((xy)^n / (x² + y²)^m)? That seems complicated.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the original equation (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n. Taking logarithms, m log(x² + y²) = n log(xy). Therefore, m/n = log(xy)/log(x² + y²). Since m and n are coprime, this suggests that the ratio log(xy)/log(x² + y²) must be a rational number m/n. But unless x and y are chosen such that xy is a power of x² + y², which seems restrictive. For example, in the case x=y, then x² + y²=2x², and xy=x². So, equation becomes (2x²)^m = (x²)^n =&gt; 2^m x^{2m} =x^{2n} =&gt; 2^m =x^{2(n - m)}. Therefore, x must be a power of 2, and 2(n - m)=m, so n=(3m)/2. But since n must be integer, m must be even. Let m=2k, then n=3k. But m and n must be coprime. So gcd(2k, 3k)=k. Therefore, k=1. Hence, m=2, n=3, x=2^{k}=2^{1}=2. Which is the solution we found earlier. So, this gives only the solution when x=y. Therefore, there are no other solutions with x=y except when m is even, leading to the known solution. If x≠y, does there exist a solution?Suppose m=2, n=3. Let&#39;s assume x≠y. Let me set x=2, y=4. Then, (4 + 16)^2=400 vs (8)^3=512, no. x=3, y=6: (9 + 36)^2=2025 vs 18^3=5832, no. Not working. x=1, y=2: 25 vs 8, no. So, seems no solution with x≠y. What about higher m? For m=4, n=5. Let&#39;s try x=2, y=2: (4 +4)^4=4096 vs 16^5=1048576, no. Wait, but x=4, y=4: (16 +16)^4=32^4=1048576 vs (16)^5=1048576. So, x=4, y=4 works. But if x=8, y=8: (64 +64)^4=128^4 vs (64)^5=64^5. 128^4=2^{7*4}=2^{28}; 64^5=2^{6*5}=2^{30}. Not equal. Wait, so x=8, y=8 doesn&#39;t work. Wait, x=4, y=4: 32^4=16^5? 32^4= (2^5)^4=2^20. 16^5=(2^4)^5=2^20. So yes, equal. But if x=2^{m/2}, y=2^{m/2}, then (2^{m} +2^{m})^m = (2^{m} *2^{m})^n. So, (2*2^{m})^m = (2^{2m})^n. So, (2^{m+1})^m = 2^{2m n}. So, 2^{m(m +1)} =2^{2m n}. Therefore, exponents must be equal: m(m +1)=2m n =&gt; (m +1)=2n. Wait, but earlier we had n=m+1 when m is even. Wait, this contradicts. Wait, let&#39;s re-examine. Wait, when x=y=2^{m/2}, then x² + y²=2*(2^{m}) =2^{m +1}. Then, (x² + y²)^m=(2^{m +1})^m=2^{m(m +1)}. On the other hand, (xy)^n=(2^{m/2}*2^{m/2})^n=(2^{m})^n=2^{m n}. Therefore, 2^{m(m +1)}=2^{m n} =&gt; m(m +1)=m n =&gt; n=m +1. Therefore, that&#39;s correct. So, in this case, n=m +1. Therefore, the solution x=y=2^{m/2}, n=m +1 satisfies the equation. And since m and n=m +1 are coprime, which is true because consecutive integers are coprime.Therefore, in conclusion, for each even positive integer m, there is a solution with n=m +1 and x=y=2^{m/2}. For odd m, there are no solutions. Therefore, the answer is:If m is even, then the triples are (n, x, y)=(m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}). If m is odd, there are no solutions.But let&#39;s check for m=6. Then n=7, x=y=2^3=8. Then, (64 +64)^6=128^6 vs (8*8)^7=64^7. 128^6=2^{7*6}=2^{42}, 64^7=2^{6*7}=2^{42}. Equal, so correct. For m=1, no solutions. For m=2, n=3, x=y=2. Correct. For m=3, no solutions. So, this seems consistent.Therefore, the final answer is that for each even positive integer m, the only solution is (n, x, y)=(m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and there are no solutions when m is odd. So, expressed formally:All positive integer triples are given by ( boxed{(n, x, y) = left(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}right)} ) when ( m ) is even, and no solutions exist when ( m ) is odd.But the problem asks to &quot;find all positive integer triples (n, x, y)&quot;, so depending on the parity of m. However, the problem states &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, so perhaps we need to phrase the answer as: If m is even, then the triples are (m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), otherwise, there are no solutions. Since the problem is from the Putnam competition, the answer likely expects the form for even m, and stating no solutions otherwise.But in the required format, the answer should be boxed. However, the original problem is asking for all triples for a given m. So, depending on whether m is even or odd. So, the answer is: If m is even, the only solution is (m+1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and no solutions exist if m is odd. So, the box should contain that, but since we need to present all solutions for a given m, and the problem is in the style of the Putnam competition, the answer is either the triple or that there are no solutions. But since the problem says &quot;find all positive integer triples&quot;, the answer is either empty or the triple mentioned. But in the original 1992 Putnam problem, the answer is only the solutions for even m, as in the problem statement.Wait, actually, checking the 53rd William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, 1992, Problem:“Find all positive integer triples (n, x, y) where m and n are coprime, and satisfy (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n.”Wait, actually, the problem states m and n are coprime. Wait, in the original problem, is m given? The user wrote:&quot;For a given positive integer m, find all positive integer triples (n, x, y), where m, n are coprime, and satisfy  left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)^{m}=(x y)^{n} . (53rd American Putnam Mathematical Competition, 1992)&quot;So, m is a given positive integer, and we need to find all triples (n, x, y) with m and n coprime, and satisfying the equation. So, the answer is that if m is even, then n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}, which are integers since m is even. And if m is odd, no solutions. Since m and n must be coprime. When m is even, n=m+1 is odd, so gcd(m, m+1)=1 because m and m+1 are consecutive integers. Hence, for even m, the solution exists. For odd m, there are no solutions.Hence, the answer is that for each even positive integer m, the only solution is (n, x, y) = (m+1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and there are no solutions when m is odd. Therefore, writing this in boxed form as per the problem&#39;s requirement. But since the problem says &quot;find all... triples&quot;, we need to present the answer accordingly.But since the problem is for a given m, so depending on m. If m is even, the triple is (m+1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}). If m is odd, no triples exist. Therefore, in the boxed answer, for a general m, we can write:If m is even, then the solutions are boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})}, otherwise there are no solutions.But the problem might expect the answer in a particular format. Since in the Putnam competition, the answer would likely be written as the triple when m is even and stated no solutions otherwise. Given the problem&#39;s wording, since m is given, and we need to find all triples, the answer is either the triple or there are none. So, formally:All solutions are given by boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})} when m is even, and no solutions exist when m is odd.But the user instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}.However, typically, in competition problems like Putnam, the answer might be expected in a specific form. Given the problem asks for all triples, and the solution only exists for even m, with n=m+1 and x=y=2^{m/2}, then boxed as:boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})}But with a note that this is only when m is even. However, in the context of the problem, since m is a given positive integer, the answer would be this triple if m is even, and no solutions otherwise. But the problem might require to specify the condition on m. However, considering that the original problem from 1992 Putnam has the answer as the triple when m is even, and no solutions otherwise. Therefore, the answer is boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})} when m is even.But since the user hasn&#39;t specified whether m is even or odd, but the problem says &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, and to present all triples, which depend on m. However, the problem is written as in the 1992 Putnam, where the answer is the triple (n, x, y) = (m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}) when m is even. Therefore, in the required format, the answer is:boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})}But if m is given as a specific even integer, but since it&#39;s general, the answer is as above. However, perhaps the problem expects the general form, so this is the answer.Final AnswerFor even ( m ), the solution is boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})}. If ( m ) is odd, there are no solutions.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding all positive integer triples ((n, x, y)) where (m) and (n) are coprime, and satisfy ((x^2 + y^2)^m = (xy)^n), we start by analyzing the given equation.1. Common Divisors and Prime Factors:   - If a prime (p) divides (x) or (y), it must divide both (x) and (y). Thus, (x) and (y) must have a common divisor (d). Let (x = da) and (y = db) where (a) and (b) are coprime.2. Substitution and Simplification:   - Substituting (x = da) and (y = db) into the equation, we get:     [     (d^2(a^2 + b^2))^m = (d^2ab)^n     ]   - Simplifying, we find:     [     d^{2m}(a^2 + b^2)^m = d^{2n}(ab)^n     ]   - Dividing both sides by (d^{2m}), we have:     [     (a^2 + b^2)^m = d^{2(n - m)}(ab)^n     ]3. Coprime Analysis:   - Since (a) and (b) are coprime, (a^2 + b^2) and (ab) are also coprime. This implies that both sides must be powers of coprime factors.   - For the equation to hold, (d^{2(n - m)}) must be 1, implying (d = 1) if (a) and (b) are not 1. However, if (a) and (b) are 1, then (x = y = d).4. Solving for (d):   - If (a = b = 1), then (x = y = d). Substituting back, we get:     [     (2d^2)^m = (d^2)^n implies 2^m d^{2m} = d^{2n} implies 2^m = d^{2(n - m)}     ]   - This implies (d = 2^{m/2}) when (m) is even. Letting (m = 2k), we find (n = m + 1) and (d = 2^k).5. Conclusion:   - For even (m), the solution is (n = m + 1) and (x = y = 2^{m/2}).   - For odd (m), no solutions exist because (2^m) cannot be expressed as (d^{2(n - m)}) with integer (d).Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2})}]when (m) is even. If (m) is odd, there are no solutions.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all positive integer triples (n, x, y) such that for a given positive integer m, which is coprime with n, the equation (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n holds. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem step by step.First, m and n are coprime, meaning gcd(m, n) = 1. The equation relates x and y through exponents m and n. Both sides of the equation are positive integers since x, y, m, n are positive integers. So, perhaps I can start by looking for possible relationships between x and y that would make this equation true.Let me consider taking prime factorizations of x and y. Suppose x and y have prime factors. Then, both sides of the equation need to have the same prime factors raised to the same powers. On the left side, we have (x² + y²)^m. That&#39;s a bit tricky because x² + y² is a sum, which complicates the prime factorization. On the right side, (xy)^n is more straightforward—it&#39;s the product of the prime factors of x and y each raised to the power of n.Since m and n are coprime, maybe there&#39;s a way to express x and y such that x² + y² is a perfect n-th power and xy is a perfect m-th power. Wait, but the equation is (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n. So, perhaps x² + y² is a perfect (n/m)th power and xy is a perfect (m/n)th power? But m and n are integers, so unless n divides m or vice versa, which they don&#39;t because they are coprime. So maybe another approach.Alternatively, since m and n are coprime, we can use the property that if a^k = b^l and gcd(k, l)=1, then a and b must be perfect l-th and k-th powers, respectively. So maybe here, (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n, and since gcd(m, n)=1, x² + y² must be a perfect n-th power, and xy must be a perfect m-th power. Let me check that.If (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n, then if I set A = x² + y² and B = xy, the equation becomes A^m = B^n. Since gcd(m, n)=1, then A must be a perfect n-th power and B must be a perfect m-th power. Yes, that seems right. Because if A^m = B^n, then since m and n are coprime, A = t^n and B = t^m for some integer t. Wait, is that necessarily true?Yes, if A^m = B^n, then the prime factors of A must each have exponents divisible by n, and the prime factors of B must each have exponents divisible by m. Because when you raise A to the m, the exponents become m times the exponents in A, and similarly for B. Since m and n are coprime, the exponents in A must be multiples of n, so A is an n-th power, and B is an m-th power. Therefore, we can write A = a^n and B = b^m for some integers a and b. But then, substituting back, (a^n)^m = (b^m)^n, which is a^{mn} = b^{mn}, so a = b. Therefore, A = B^{n/m} and B = A^{m/n}, but since A and B are integers, m divides the exponent of B, and n divides the exponent of A. Wait, maybe this is more straightforward: since A^m = B^n and gcd(m, n)=1, then A = c^n and B = c^m for some integer c. Because if A^m = B^n, then the exponents of all primes in A must be multiples of n, and in B multiples of m. Let me check with an example. Let c be an integer, then set A = c^n, B = c^m. Then A^m = c^{n m} and B^n = c^{m n}, so they are equal. Conversely, if A^m = B^n, then all primes in A must have exponents such that m * exponent is divisible by n, so exponent must be divisible by n/gcd(m, n) = n, since gcd(m, n)=1. Therefore, A is an n-th power, and similarly B is an m-th power. Therefore, yes, A = c^n and B = c^m for some integer c.Therefore, in our case, x² + y² = c^n and xy = c^m for some positive integer c.So, our problem reduces to solving the system:1. x² + y² = c^n2. xy = c^mwith x, y, c positive integers, and gcd(m, n)=1.So, we need to find positive integers x, y, c, n, m such that these two equations hold, with m and n coprime.Given that m is given, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;for a given positive integer m, find all positive integer triples (n, x, y), where m, n are coprime, and satisfy...&quot; So m is fixed, and we have to find triples (n, x, y) where n is coprime to m, and x and y satisfy the equation.So, given m, find n, x, y such that gcd(m, n)=1 and (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n.So, perhaps first, given that x and y are positive integers, let&#39;s assume that x and y are multiples of c, since xy = c^m. So let&#39;s set x = c^a and y = c^b, such that a + b = m. Wait, but then xy = c^{a + b} = c^m, so a + b = m. Then, x² + y² = c^{2a} + c^{2b} = c^{2a} + c^{2(m - a)}. Then, this sum must equal c^n. Hmm, but c^{2a} + c^{2(m - a)} = c^n. Let&#39;s factor out the smaller term. Suppose a ≤ m - a, so a ≤ m/2. Then, x² + y² = c^{2a}(1 + c^{2(m - 2a)}) = c^n. Therefore, 1 + c^{2(m - 2a)} must be a power of c. Let&#39;s denote k = 2(m - 2a). Then, 1 + c^k = c^{n - 2a}. So, 1 + c^k = c^l, where l = n - 2a. We need to solve 1 + c^k = c^l for positive integers c, k, l. This is a classic equation. The solutions to this are limited. Let&#39;s recall that for positive integers c, k, l, the equation c^l - c^k = 1. The only solutions are when c=2, l=1, k=0, but k must be positive. Or c=1, which would lead to 1 - 1 =0 ≠1. Wait, perhaps another approach. If c ≥ 2, then c^l - c^k =1. For c ≥2, c^l - c^k ≥ 2^l - 2^{l-1} = 2^{l-1} ≥1 only possible if l -1=0, so l=1, which would imply 2^1 -2^k=1 → 2 -2^k=1 →2^k=1→k=0, but k must be positive. So no solutions for c≥2. For c=1, 1^l -1^k=0≠1. Therefore, no solutions. Therefore, there is no solution unless... Wait, but in our equation, 1 + c^k = c^l, so c^l - c^k =1. As per the above, no solutions. Therefore, our initial assumption that x and y are powers of c might not hold. Therefore, maybe x and y have common factors? Wait, but if x and y have a common factor d, then we can factor d out from both x and y, and write x = d * x&#39;, y = d * y&#39;, so the equation becomes (d²(x&#39;² + y&#39;²))^m = (d² x&#39;y&#39;)^n. Then, d^{2m} (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2n} (x&#39;y&#39;)^n. So, (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39;y&#39;)^n. But since we can factor out the common factors, perhaps we can assume that x and y are coprime? Wait, but the problem does not state that x and y are coprime. However, if there is a common factor, we can factor it out, but then the equation relates the exponents of d. So, for the equation to hold, unless 2(n - m) =0, which would require n = m, but n and m are coprime, so n = m =1. Otherwise, if n ≠ m, then d^{2(n - m)} must divide (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m. But since x&#39; and y&#39; are coprime (if we factor out the greatest common divisor), then x&#39;² + y&#39;² and x&#39;y&#39; are also coprime? Wait, if x&#39; and y&#39; are coprime, then x&#39;y&#39; and x&#39;² + y&#39;² are coprime? Let&#39;s check. Suppose a prime p divides x&#39;y&#39; and x&#39;² + y&#39;². Then p divides x&#39; or y&#39;. Suppose p divides x&#39;. Then since p divides x&#39;² + y&#39;², p divides y&#39;², so p divides y&#39;, contradicting that x&#39; and y&#39; are coprime. Therefore, yes, x&#39;² + y&#39;² and x&#39;y&#39; are coprime. Therefore, (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39;y&#39;)^n are coprime. Therefore, in the equation (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39;y&#39;)^n, since the left-hand side and the right-hand side have coprime factors, both sides must be 1. But since x&#39;, y&#39;, d are positive integers, the only way is x&#39;² + y&#39;² =1 and x&#39;y&#39; =1, and d^{2(n - m)}=1. But x&#39; and y&#39; are positive integers, so x&#39; = y&#39; =1. Then x&#39;² + y&#39;²=2, which is not 1. Contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is that 2(n - m)=0, so n = m, but n and m must be coprime. Therefore, n = m =1. Then, the equation becomes (x² + y²)^1 = (xy)^1, so x² + y² = xy. But for positive integers x and y, x² + y² ≥ 2xy ≥ xy, with equality only if x = y =0, which is not allowed. Therefore, no solution. Wait, this seems like a dead end. Therefore, our assumption that x and y have a common factor leads us to no solutions unless n = m =1, which is impossible. Therefore, maybe x and y must be coprime? Let&#39;s try that.Assume that x and y are coprime. Then, since (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n, and x and y are coprime, then x² + y² and xy are coprime. Because any common prime factor of x² + y² and xy would have to divide both x and y, but they are coprime. Therefore, (x² + y²)^m and (xy)^n are coprime. Therefore, the only way these two can be equal is if both are equal to 1. But x and y are positive integers, so xy ≥1, and x² + y² ≥2, so (x² + y²)^m ≥2^m ≥2, which is greater than 1. Therefore, no solutions? Wait, that can&#39;t be. There must be a mistake here.Wait, perhaps my reasoning is wrong. Let&#39;s check again. If x and y are coprime, then x² + y² and xy are coprime. Therefore, (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n implies that both sides are equal to 1. But since x and y are positive integers, this is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that x and y are not coprime. Therefore, they must share some common factor. But when we factor out the common factor, as we did before, we run into the problem that n must equal m, which can&#39;t happen unless n = m =1. But even then, there&#39;s no solution. Therefore, perhaps there are no solutions? But the problem is from the Putnam competition, so there must be some solutions. Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the beginning.Wait, let&#39;s try plugging in small values for m and see if we can find solutions.Suppose m =1. Then we need to find n coprime to 1 (so any n), such that (x² + y²)^1 = (xy)^n. So x² + y² = (xy)^n. Let&#39;s see if there are solutions here. For n=1: x² + y² = xy. As before, no solutions. For n=2: x² + y² = (xy)^2. Let’s try small x and y. x=1, y=1: 1 +1=1, nope. x=1, y=2: 1 +4=4 →5=4 no. x=2, y=2: 4 +4=16 →8=16 no. x=1, y=3: 1 +9=9 →10=9 no. Similarly, no solutions. For n=3: x² + y² = (xy)^3. Even larger right-hand side. Seems impossible. So maybe no solutions for m=1.Wait, but the problem states that m is a given positive integer, and find triples (n, x, y) with m and n coprime. So maybe for certain m, there are solutions. Let&#39;s try m=2.For m=2, find n coprime with 2 (so n must be odd), and (x² + y²)^2 = (xy)^n.Again, trying small n. Let&#39;s take n=1 (coprime with 2). Then (x² + y²)^2 = xy. Left side is at least (1 +1)^2=4, right side is at least1. No solution. n=3: (x² + y²)^2 = (xy)^3. Let&#39;s try x=y=2: left side (4 +4)^2=64, right side (4)^3=64. So (n, x, y)=(3,2,2). But wait, m=2 and n=3 are coprime. So this is a solution. Wait, so there exists a solution for m=2, n=3, x=2, y=2. But in that case, x and y are not coprime, but the problem doesn&#39;t require x and y to be coprime. So maybe there are solutions where x and y share common factors.So, how did that happen? Let&#39;s see. For m=2, n=3, x=2, y=2:Left-hand side: (4 +4)^2 =8^2=64.Right-hand side: (2*2)^3=4^3=64.So yes, that works. So this is a valid solution. Therefore, there are solutions, but x and y need not be coprime. Therefore, my previous reasoning about x and y being coprime leading to no solutions was correct, but x and y can have common factors, leading to solutions.Therefore, perhaps the key is to factor out the greatest common divisor of x and y. Let&#39;s let d = gcd(x, y), so x = d * x&#39;, y = d * y&#39;, where gcd(x&#39;, y&#39;)=1. Then, substituting into the equation:Left-hand side: (d² x&#39;² + d² y&#39;²)^m = (d² (x&#39;² + y&#39;²))^m = d^{2m} (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m.Right-hand side: (d x&#39; * d y&#39;)^n = (d² x&#39; y&#39;)^n = d^{2n} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n.Therefore, equating both sides:d^{2m} (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2n} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n.Dividing both sides by d^{2m} (assuming d ≠0, which it isn&#39;t):(x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n.Since x&#39; and y&#39; are coprime, as we factored out the gcd, then x&#39;² + y&#39;² and x&#39; y&#39; are coprime. Because any prime dividing x&#39; y&#39; must divide x&#39; or y&#39;, but since x&#39; and y&#39; are coprime, such a prime cannot divide x&#39;² + y&#39;². Therefore, (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n are coprime. Therefore, the equation (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n implies that both (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n must be equal to 1, or that d^{2(n - m)} must be 1. But x&#39;, y&#39;, d are positive integers, so the only way this holds is if:(x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m =1 and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n =1, and d^{2(n - m)}=1.But since x&#39; and y&#39; are positive integers, x&#39;² + y&#39;² ≥2, so the first equation cannot hold. Therefore, the only possibility is that d^{2(n - m)}=1, which requires n = m. But n and m must be coprime. Therefore, n = m =1. However, as we saw before, even then the equation x² + y² = xy has no solutions in positive integers. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, our approach must be wrong.But wait, we found a solution earlier with m=2, n=3, x=2, y=2. How does that fit into this? Let&#39;s check that. For m=2, n=3, x=2, y=2. Then, d = gcd(2, 2)=2. So x&#39; =1, y&#39;=1. Then, the equation becomes:Left-hand side: (1² +1²)^2 = (2)^2=4.Right-hand side: d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n =2^{2(3 -2)}*(1*1)^3=2^{2}*1=4.Therefore, 4=4. So in this case, even though x&#39; and y&#39; are 1, which would make x&#39;² + y&#39;²=2, which is not 1, but multiplied by d^{2m} gives the left-hand side. Wait, but in our previous step-by-step, we divided by d^{2m}, leading to (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39; y&#39;)^n. In this example, (1² +1²)^2=4, and d^{2(n - m)}*(1*1)^3=2^{2(3-2)}=4. So indeed, 4=4. Therefore, in this case, the equation holds even though x&#39; and y&#39; are not 0. Therefore, my previous conclusion that x&#39;² + y&#39;² and x&#39; y&#39; must be 1 is incorrect. Instead, both sides can have common factors through the d term. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n are coprime. But in this case, x&#39;=1, y&#39;=1, so x&#39; y&#39;=1, and x&#39;² + y&#39;²=2. Then, (2)^2=4 and (1)^3=1, multiplied by d^{2(n - m)}=4. So, 4=4. Therefore, in this case, even though (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n are coprime (since 4 and1 are coprime), the d term accounts for the remaining factor. Therefore, perhaps the correct reasoning is that since (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n are coprime, then each must be a power of d. Wait, but in this case, (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m =2^2 and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n=1, and d^{2(n - m)}=2^{2(1)}=4. Therefore, 2^2=4=4*1. So, this works. Therefore, more generally, if we have:(x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m = d^{2(n - m)} * (x&#39; y&#39;)^n.But since (x&#39;² + y&#39;²) and (x&#39; y&#39;) are coprime, then each must be a perfect power to satisfy the equation. That is, (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m must be equal to d^{2(n - m)} times (x&#39; y&#39;)^n. Since (x&#39;² + y&#39;²) and (x&#39; y&#39;) are coprime, then both d^{2(n - m)} and (x&#39; y&#39;)^n must divide (x&#39;² + y&#39;²)^m. But since (x&#39; y&#39;) and (x&#39;² + y&#39;²) are coprime, then (x&#39; y&#39;)^n must divide 1, which is only possible if x&#39; y&#39;=1. Therefore, x&#39;=1 and y&#39;=1. Therefore, x = d *1 = d, y = d *1 =d. Therefore, x = y =d. Then, substituting back into the original equation:(x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n → (2d²)^m = (d²)^n → 2^m d^{2m} = d^{2n} → 2^m = d^{2(n - m)}.Therefore, d^{2(n - m)} =2^m. So, 2(n - m) must divide m, and d must be a power of 2. Let’s denote d=2^k, where k is a non-negative integer. Then, d^{2(n - m)} =2^{2k(n - m)}=2^m. Therefore, 2k(n - m)=m. So, 2k(n - m)=m. Since m and n are coprime, let&#39;s analyze this equation.Given that m and n are coprime, and 2k(n - m)=m. Let&#39;s rearrange this: 2k(n - m)=m →2kn - 2km =m →2kn =m(2k +1). Therefore, m divides 2kn. But since gcd(m, n)=1, m divides 2k. Let&#39;s denote 2k =m * t for some positive integer t. Then, substituting back into 2kn =m(2k +1):2k n =m(2k +1) → m * t *n = m( m * t +1 ) → t n = m t +1 → t(n -m)=1.Since t and (n -m) are positive integers, the only solution is t=1 and n -m=1. Therefore, n =m +1. Also, from 2k =m * t =m *1 =m, so k =m/2. But k must be an integer, so m must be even. Therefore, m is even, n =m +1, and d=2^{m/2}.Therefore, the solution exists only when m is even. Then, n =m +1, which is coprime with m since m and m+1 are consecutive integers, hence coprime. Then, d=2^{m/2}, and x = y =d=2^{m/2}.Therefore, in summary, for even m, there is a solution with n =m +1, and x = y =2^{m/2}. For example, when m=2, n=3, x=y=2^{1}=2, which matches the solution we found earlier. Similarly, if m=4, n=5, x=y=2^{2}=4. Let’s check: (4² +4²)^4 = (16 +16)^4=32^4=1048576, and (4*4)^5=16^5=1048576. Correct.Therefore, for each even m, there is a solution with n =m +1, x = y =2^{m/2}. Now, we need to check if there are other solutions.Suppose there are other solutions where x ≠ y. Let’s see. Suppose x ≠ y. Then, in the equation (x² + y²)^m = (xy)^n. Let&#39;s assume x and y are not both equal. For example, take m=2, n=3. Let&#39;s see if there are solutions other than x=y=2. Suppose x=1, y=2: (1 +4)^2=25 vs (1*2)^3=8, no. x=1, y=4: (1 +16)^2=289 vs (1*4)^3=64, no. x=2, y=4: (4 +16)^2=400 vs (8)^3=512, no. So only x=y=2 works. Maybe for other m, similar things happen.Suppose m=4, n=5. Then x=y=4. Let&#39;s check x=2, y=2: (4 +4)^4=4096 vs (4)^5=1024, no. x=8, y=8: (64 +64)^4=(128)^4 vs (64)^5. 128^4=2^{7*4}=2^{28}, 64^5=2^{6*5}=2^{30}, which is larger. Not equal. So only x=y=4 works. So perhaps the only solutions are when x=y=2^{m/2} and n=m+1 for even m.But wait, let&#39;s check m=6, n=7. Then x=y=2^{3}=8. Then (64 +64)^6=128^6 vs (8*8)^7=64^7. 128^6=2^{7*6}=2^{42}, 64^7=2^{6*7}=2^{42}. So they are equal. So indeed, this works.Now, suppose m is odd. For example, m=3. Then, n has to be coprime to 3, so n cannot be a multiple of 3. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a solution. Let&#39;s try n=4. Then, the equation is (x² + y²)^3 = (xy)^4. Let&#39;s see if there are any solutions. Suppose x=y. Then, (2x²)^3 =x^8 →8x^6 =x^8 →8 =x² →x=2√2, which is not integer. So no solution. What if x ≠ y? Let&#39;s try small numbers. x=1, y=2: (1 +4)^3=125 vs (1*2)^4=16, no. x=1, y=4: (1 +16)^3=4913 vs (1*4)^4=256, no. x=2, y=2: already checked. x=2, y=4: (4 +16)^3=8000 vs (8)^4=4096, no. x=2, y=1: same as x=1, y=2. Hmm. Maybe there are no solutions for odd m?Similarly, for m=1, n must be coprime to 1, so any n. But as we saw earlier, there are no solutions. Therefore, perhaps the only solutions are for even m, with n =m +1 and x=y=2^{m/2}.But let&#39;s check another even m, say m=6. Then n=7, x=y=8. (64 +64)^6=128^6=2^{7*6}=2^{42}, and (8*8)^7=64^7=2^{6*7}=2^{42}. Equal. So that works. So the pattern holds.Therefore, the only solutions are when m is even, n =m +1, and x = y =2^{m/2}.But let&#39;s confirm if these are the only solutions. Suppose there exists another solution where x ≠ y. Let&#39;s assume such a solution exists. Let’s take m=2, n=3. Suppose there are x and y not both equal to 2. Let’s see. The equation (x² + y²)^2 = (xy)^3. Let’s denote a =x/y. Then, (a² +1)^2 = (a)^3. Solving for a: (a² +1)^2 =a³ →a⁴ + 2a² +1 =a³ →a⁴ -a³ +2a² +1=0. This equation might have rational solutions. By Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are ±1. Testing a=1:1 -1 +2 +1=3≠0. a=-1:1 +1 +2 +1=5≠0. Therefore, no rational solutions. Therefore, x/y is irrational, meaning x and y cannot be integers in such a case. Therefore, the only solution is x=y=2.Therefore, in general, the only solutions are x=y=2^{m/2} when m is even, leading to n=m+1. Therefore, for each even m, there is a unique solution with n=m+1 and x=y=2^{m/2}. For odd m, there are no solutions.Wait, but let&#39;s check m=0, though m is positive. So m≥1. Therefore, for even m≥2, solutions exist, and for odd m≥1, no solutions. Therefore, the answer is: For each even positive integer m, the triples are (n, x, y) = (m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and there are no solutions for odd m.But the problem states &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, so depending on whether m is even or odd, the answer varies. Therefore, the final answer is: If m is even, then the only solution is n =m +1, x = y =2^{m/2}; otherwise, there are no solutions.But let&#39;s verify once more with m=4. Then n=5, x=y=16? Wait, 2^{4/2}=4. Wait, no, 2^{m/2}. For m=4, 2^{4/2}=4. Then, (16 +16)^4=32^4=1048576, and (4*4)^5=16^5=1048576. Correct. For m=6, n=7, x=y=8. As checked before. So yes, the formula holds.Therefore, the conclusion is that for each even m, the solution is n=m+1, x=y=2^{m/2}, and no solutions exist for odd m. Therefore, the answer is that all positive integer triples are given by n =m +1, x = y =2^{m/2} when m is even, and no solutions exist when m is odd.But the problem states &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, so the answer depends on m. However, since the question is to &quot;find all positive integer triples (n, x, y)&quot;, given m, we can express the answer as follows: If m is even, then the only solution is (n, x, y) = (m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and if m is odd, there are no solutions.But let&#39;s check for m=2, n=3: 2 and3 are coprime. Similarly, m=4, n=5: gcd(4,5)=1. Yes, since n=m+1 and m is even, m and n=m+1 are coprime because consecutive integers are coprime.Therefore, the final answer is that for each even positive integer m, the triples are (m +1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}), and there are no triples when m is odd. So, written in boxed form, if required for a specific m, but since the problem says &quot;for a given positive integer m&quot;, the answer should be expressed in terms of m.Final AnswerFor each even positive integer ( m ), the solutions are ( boxed{(n, x, y) = left(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}right)} ). If ( m ) is odd, there are no solutions.&lt;/think&gt;Given a positive integer ( m ), we need to find all positive integer triples ( (n, x, y) ) such that ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime, and they satisfy the equation:[(x^2 + y^2)^m = (xy)^n] Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Coprimality and Prime Factorization:   - Since ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime, if ( (x^2 + y^2)^m = (xy)^n ), then ( x^2 + y^2 ) must be a perfect ( n )-th power and ( xy ) must be a perfect ( m )-th power.   - This implies ( x^2 + y^2 = c^n ) and ( xy = c^m ) for some integer ( c ).2. Common Factor Analysis:   - Let ( d = gcd(x, y) ). Write ( x = d x&#39; ) and ( y = d y&#39; ) where ( gcd(x&#39;, y&#39;) = 1 ).   - Substituting into the equation, we get ( (d^2 (x&#39;^2 + y&#39;^2))^m = (d^2 x&#39;y&#39;)^n ), leading to ( d^{2m} (x&#39;^2 + y&#39;^2)^m = d^{2n} (x&#39;y&#39;)^n ).3. Simplifying the Equation:   - Dividing both sides by ( d^{2m} ), we get ( (x&#39;^2 + y&#39;^2)^m = d^{2(n - m)} (x&#39;y&#39;)^n ).   - Since ( x&#39; ) and ( y&#39; ) are coprime, ( x&#39;^2 + y&#39;^2 ) and ( x&#39;y&#39; ) are coprime. This implies both sides must be powers of ( d ).4. Solving for ( d ):   - For the equation to hold, ( d ) must be a power of 2. Let ( d = 2^k ). This leads to the equation ( 2k(n - m) = m ).   - Solving this, we find ( n = m + 1 ) and ( d = 2^{m/2} ), which requires ( m ) to be even.5. Conclusion:   - For even ( m ), the solution is ( n = m + 1 ), ( x = y = 2^{m/2} ).   - For odd ( m ), no solutions exist because ( n = m + 1 ) would not be coprime with ( m ), and the equation cannot hold. Final Answer:For each even positive integer ( m ), the solutions are ( boxed{(n, x, y) = left(m + 1, 2^{m/2}, 2^{m/2}right)} ). If ( m ) is odd, there are no solutions.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb740fc7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>🔑:</span>[Solution] Let (n, x, y) be a set of positive integer solutions to the equation.By the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, we have(x y)^{n}=left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)^{m} geqslant(2 x y)^{m} .Therefore, n&gt;m.Let p be a prime number, and p^{a}left|x, p^{b}right| y.

COWS AND SHEEPTwo men jointly owned x cows, which they sold for x dollars a head. With the money they received, they bought sheep at 12 dollars a head. Since the proceeds from the sale of the cows did not divide by 12, they used the remaining money to buy a lamb. Then they divided the flock so that each of them had the same number of animals. The man with the lamb was therefore somewhat shortchanged. To make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica. How much is the harmonica worth?</div><div class="divider" data-v-cb740fc7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there are two men who jointly owned x cows. They sold each cow for x dollars, so total money they got would be x cows times x dollars per cow, which is x² dollars. Then they used that money to buy sheep at 12 dollars per head. But the problem says the proceeds didn&#39;t divide evenly by 12, so they had some leftover money, which they used to buy a lamb. After that, they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. The guy who got the lamb was shortchanged, so the other man gave him his harmonica to make up for it. We need to find out how much the harmonica is worth.Hmm. Let&#39;s break this down step by step. First, total money from selling cows is x² dollars. Then they buy sheep at 12 each. So if x² divided by 12 gives a quotient and remainder. Let&#39;s write that as x² = 12y + r, where y is the number of sheep they can buy, and r is the remaining money, which is used to buy a lamb. Since they can&#39;t buy a sheep with the remaining money, r must be less than 12. But the lamb costs r dollars. So total animals bought are y sheep plus 1 lamb. Then they need to divide these animals equally between the two men. Since y is the number of sheep, let&#39;s think about y + 1 animals total. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of animals is y sheep plus 1 lamb, so total is y + 1 animals. They need to split this into two equal parts. But y + 1 must be an even number? Or maybe they can divide the animals such that each gets the same number, but one gets the lamb and some sheep, and the other gets the remaining sheep. But since y might be even or odd, but since total animals is y + 1, so if y is even, then y +1 is odd, which can&#39;t be split equally. Wait, but the problem says they divided the flock so that each had the same number of animals. So maybe it&#39;s possible that the total number of animals is even? Wait, but the total is y + 1. So y +1 must be even? That would require y to be odd. But y is x² divided by 12, so x² = 12y + r. If x² mod 12 is equal to r, which is less than 12, then y is the quotient. So if x² is, say, 12y + r, then y = floor(x² /12). Then the total number of animals is y +1. So for that to be divisible by 2, y +1 must be even, so y must be odd.But maybe that&#39;s complicating things. Let&#39;s see. The key point is that after buying y sheep and 1 lamb, they have y +1 animals. They need to divide these equally. So each person gets (y +1)/2 animals. Since you can&#39;t split a sheep or a lamb, (y +1) must be even. Therefore, y +1 is even, so y must be odd. Therefore, y is odd. So x² divided by 12 gives an odd quotient y and a remainder r. So x² = 12y + r, where y is odd, r is between 1 and 11 (since they can&#39;t divide by 12 exactly, so r ≠ 0). Then with that, they have y sheep and 1 lamb. Then each person gets (y +1)/2 animals. So one person gets (y +1)/2 animals, which is (y +1)/2 sheep and lamb? Wait, no. Wait, they have y sheep and 1 lamb. So total y +1 animals. So when they divide, each person gets (y +1)/2 animals. Since the animals are sheep and a lamb, the lamb is a different type. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that they have to divide the types equally, just the number of animals. So one person might get the lamb and some sheep, and the other person gets the remaining sheep. But since they have to have the same number of animals, each gets (y +1)/2. But since the lamb is only one, the person who gets the lamb would have (y +1)/2 -1 sheep, and the other person would have (y +1)/2 sheep. Wait, no, maybe. Let&#39;s see. Suppose total animals: y sheep +1 lamb. So if you divide them into two equal parts, each part has (y +1)/2 animals. Since there&#39;s only one lamb, one person must get the lamb plus (y +1)/2 -1 sheep, and the other person gets (y +1)/2 sheep. Therefore, the person with the lamb has one less sheep than the other person. Therefore, the difference in the value between the two shares is the value of one sheep minus the value of the lamb. But the lamb was bought with the remaining money r, so the lamb is worth r dollars, and each sheep is worth 12 dollars. Therefore, the person with the lamb is shortchanged by (12 - r) dollars. To make up for this difference, the other man gives him a harmonica worth (12 - r)/2 dollars? Wait, no, maybe the difference is 12 - r, so the harmonica must be worth that difference. Wait, let&#39;s think carefully.Each person is supposed to have equal value. The total value is 12y + r (from the original sale). So each should get (12y + r)/2 dollars worth. The person with the lamb gets (12*( (y +1)/2 -1 ) + r) dollars. The other person gets 12*( (y +1)/2 ) dollars. The difference between these two should be the value of the harmonica. Let&#39;s compute that.First, person A has ( (y +1)/2 -1 ) sheep and 1 lamb. So value is 12*( (y +1)/2 -1 ) + r.Person B has (y +1)/2 sheep, so value is 12*( (y +1)/2 ).The difference is Person B&#39;s value minus Person A&#39;s value:12*( (y +1)/2 ) - [12*( (y +1)/2 -1 ) + r ]Simplify this:12*( (y +1)/2 ) - 12*( (y +1)/2 -1 ) - r= 12*( (y +1)/2 - (y +1)/2 +1 ) - r= 12*(1) - r= 12 - rSo the difference is 12 - r dollars. Therefore, to make it fair, the person who has more value (Person B) needs to give the other person (Person A) half of the difference? Wait, but the problem says &quot;the man with the lamb was therefore somewhat shortchanged. To make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica.&quot; So the harmonica&#39;s value should be equal to the difference, which is 12 - r. Wait, but let&#39;s check.Wait, Person A (with the lamb) has less value. The difference is 12 - r. So to make them equal, Person B needs to give Person A (12 - r)/2. But since Person B gives a harmonica, which is worth that amount. So the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2. But wait, the problem says &quot;the second man gave him his harmonica&quot;, so maybe the harmonica is worth the entire difference? Wait, but in reality, when you have an unequal division, to make it equal, the one who has more needs to give half the difference to the other. For example, if one has 10 and the other has 6, the difference is 4, so to make it equal, the one with 10 gives 2 to the other, so each has 8. So the harmonica should be worth half the difference. Hmm. But let&#39;s check.Total value is 12y + r. Each should have (12y + r)/2. Person A has 12*( (y +1)/2 -1 ) + r. Let&#39;s compute that.First, (y +1)/2 -1 = (y +1 - 2)/2 = (y -1)/2. So Person A has 12*(y -1)/2 + r = 6(y -1) + r. Person B has 12*(y +1)/2 = 6(y +1). The difference is 6(y +1) - [6(y -1) + r] = 6y +6 -6y +6 - r = 12 - r. So indeed, the difference is 12 - r. Therefore, Person B has 12 - r more than Person A. To equalize, Person B should give Person A half of that difference, which is (12 - r)/2. So the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2. But the problem says &quot;the second man gave him his harmonica&quot;, so perhaps the harmonica&#39;s value is (12 - r)/2. However, the problem might be considering that the harmonica&#39;s value is equal to the entire difference. Wait, but in the example I thought of before, if there&#39;s a 4 difference, the harmonica would be worth 2. So it&#39;s half the difference. But maybe the problem is different.Wait, let me see. The problem states: &quot;the man with the lamb was therefore somewhat shortchanged. To make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica.&quot; So to make up for the shortfall, the harmonica&#39;s value should be equal to the amount the first man was shortchanged. If the difference is 12 - r, then the harmonica is worth 12 - r. But if we consider that by giving the harmonica, the second man transfers value from himself to the first man. So if the harmonica is worth h, then the net change is that the first man gains h, and the second man loses h. So the difference before was 12 - r. After the transfer, the new difference would be (12 - r) - 2h. To make the difference zero, we set (12 - r) - 2h = 0 =&gt; h = (12 - r)/2. Therefore, the harmonica is worth half the difference.But the problem says &quot;the man with the lamb was therefore somewhat shortchanged. To make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica.&quot; So the harmonica is given to make up for the shortfall, which is the entire difference. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the harmonica&#39;s value is equal to the difference. But according to the calculation, the difference is 12 - r. However, since they have to split the difference, the harmonica is worth half the difference. So which is it?Wait, maybe we need to think in terms of total value. The total value is 12y + r. When divided, each should get (12y + r)/2. The person with the lamb has 6(y -1) + r, and the other has 6(y +1). So the difference between them is 6(y +1) - [6(y -1) + r] = 12 - r. Therefore, the person with the lamb is short by (12 - r)/2, because the total difference is 12 - r, so each should have half of that. Wait, no. If one person has 12 - r more, then to make it equal, the person with more gives (12 - r)/2 to the other. Therefore, the harmonica&#39;s value is (12 - r)/2. So h = (12 - r)/2.But then we need to relate this to x. Because x is given, but the problem says &quot;Two men jointly owned x cows...&quot;. Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t give a specific value for x, so the answer might be in terms of x, but the question is &quot;How much is the harmonica worth?&quot; which probably is a numerical answer. So maybe x is determined from the problem&#39;s conditions.Wait, but the problem didn&#39;t specify x. So maybe x is such that x² ≡ r mod 12, with r ≠ 0, and y is odd. So perhaps we need to find x where x² mod 12 gives some remainder r, and y = (x² - r)/12 is odd. Then harmonica is (12 - r)/2. But since we need a numerical answer, there must be a unique solution. Wait, perhaps x must satisfy some conditions.Wait, maybe the problem is from a classic puzzle where the answer is 6 dollars. Let me check.But let&#39;s try to find x. Let&#39;s think of possible x values. Let&#39;s consider that x is an integer because they can&#39;t have a fraction of a cow. Then x² ≡ r mod 12, where 1 ≤ r ≤ 11. Also, since y = (x² - r)/12 must be an integer. So x² ≡ r mod 12. Also, the quotient y must be odd. So (x² - r)/12 must be odd. Therefore, x² - r = 12*(2k +1) for some integer k. Therefore, x² = 24k +12 + r. But since r &lt;12, x² ≡ r mod 24? Not sure. Maybe think of possible quadratic residues modulo 12.The possible quadratic residues modulo 12 are:0² = 0 mod121² =12²=43²=94²=16≡45²=25≡16²=36≡07²=49≡18²=64≡49²=81≡910²=100≡411²=121≡1So quadratic residues mod12 are 0,1,4,9. Since in the problem, x² ≡ r mod12, where r ≠0, so possible r is 1,4,9. Then y = (x² - r)/12 must be odd.So for each possible r in {1,4,9}, check if (x² - r)/12 is odd.Let&#39;s check:Case 1: r=1Then x² ≡1 mod12. Therefore, x ≡1,5,7,11 mod12. Then x² =12y +1. So y=(x² -1)/12. For y to be odd, (x² -1)/12 must be odd.Suppose x=1: y=(1-1)/12=0. Not possible, since they bought some sheep.x=5: y=(25 -1)/12=24/12=2. 2 is even. Not odd.x=7: y=(49 -1)/12=48/12=4. Even.x=11: y=(121 -1)/12=120/12=10. Even.So none of these gives y odd.Case 2: r=4x² ≡4 mod12. So x≡2,10 mod12.x=2: y=(4 -4)/12=0/12=0. Not possible.x=10: y=(100 -4)/12=96/12=8. Even.x=14: y=(196 -4)/12=192/12=16. Even. So no.Case 3: r=9x² ≡9 mod12. So x≡3,9 mod12.x=3: y=(9 -9)/12=0/12=0. Not possible.x=9: y=(81 -9)/12=72/12=6. Even.x=15: y=(225 -9)/12=216/12=18. Even.Hmm, so none of the possible r values (1,4,9) give y odd. But the problem states that they did buy sheep and a lamb, so y must be at least 1. So maybe there is a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic residues. Wait, let&#39;s check x=7: x²=49, which is 1 mod12. Wait, 49 divided by12 is 4*12=48, remainder 1. So yes, 49≡1 mod12. Then y=(49 -1)/12=48/12=4. Which is even. So same for x=5, etc. So all these cases give y even. But the problem says that after buying the sheep and the lamb, the total number of animals is y +1, which must be even so they can split them. So y +1 even implies y is odd. But according to the quadratic residues mod12, the only possible remainders are 0,1,4,9. If r is 1,4,9, then y=(x² -r)/12. For y to be odd, (x² -r)/12 must be odd. But as per the examples above, x²=25 (x=5), r=1: (25 -1)/12=24/12=2, even. Similarly, x=7, x²=49: (49 -1)/12=48/12=4, even. x=3: x²=9: (9 -9)/12=0/12=0, but then they didn&#39;t buy any sheep. Not possible. Similarly, x=9: (81 -9)/12=72/12=6, even.So none of the possible x with r=1,4,9 gives y odd. Then there must be something wrong with my reasoning. Wait, maybe the problem isn&#39;t in modulo12 but in modulo something else? Wait, the total money is x² dollars. They buy as many sheep as possible at 12 dollars each, so the remainder is x² mod12. Then they buy a lamb with the remainder. So the remainder must be equal to the price of the lamb, which is r dollars. Then total animals: y +1, where y= (x² -r)/12. They divide y +1 animals, which must be even. Therefore, y +1 is even =&gt; y is odd. So (x² -r)/12 must be odd. So x² -r must be divisible by12, and (x² -r)/12 is odd. So x² ≡r mod12, and x² -r =12*(2k +1). So x² =12*(2k +1) +r. Since r is x² mod12, x²=12*m +r, where m is the number of sheep. Then m must be odd. So x²=12*(2k +1) +r. Also, since r is the remainder when x² is divided by12, 0 &lt;r &lt;12. So the problem is, for x being integer, we need to find x such that (x² -r)/12 is odd, with r=x² mod12.But in our earlier analysis, when x² mod12 is1,4,9, but (x² -r)/12 is even. So how is this possible?Wait, maybe the problem doesn&#39;t require x to be an integer. Wait, but x is the number of cows, so x must be a positive integer. So there&#39;s a problem here. Maybe the problem is a classic puzzle where x is 12k + something. Wait, but according to our analysis, there is no solution. That can&#39;t be. Maybe I&#39;m missing something.Wait, let&#39;s try specific numbers. Let&#39;s suppose x=7. Then x²=49. 49 divided by12 is 4 with remainder1. So they buy4 sheep and1 lamb. Total animals 5. Then dividing into two, each would get2.5 animals. But that&#39;s impossible. So that can&#39;t be. Wait, but the problem says they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. So total animals must be even. So y +1 must be even. Therefore, y must be odd. Therefore, (x² - r)/12 must be odd. But in the cases we checked, with r=1,4,9, we get y even. So maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps my approach is wrong.Wait, maybe the remainder r is not less than12, but since they can&#39;t divide by12, the remainder is less than12. So r is between1 and11. But according to quadratic residues mod12, x² mod12 can only be0,1,4,9. So r can only be1,4,9. So maybe the answer is based on one of these. But since in all cases, y is even, then y +1 is odd, which can&#39;t be divided equally. Therefore, contradiction. So maybe the problem is in my understanding.Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the total number of animals is y +1, which must be even. Therefore, y must be odd. So (x² -r)/12 must be odd. So x² - r must be divisible by12, and (x² -r)/12 must be odd. Therefore, x² -r =12*(2k +1). So x²=24k +12 +r. But x²=24k +12 +r. Since r is x² mod12, which is either1,4,9. So 24k +12 +r ≡r mod12. 24k is 0 mod12, 12 is 0 mod12, so 0 +0 +r ≡r mod12. So that checks out. So x²=24k +12 +r. Then x²=12*(2k +1) +r. So x² must be of the form12m +r, where m is odd. But since x² mod12 can only be0,1,4,9, and in this case, r is1,4,9. Therefore, m=(x² -r)/12 must be odd. So let&#39;s see if there exists x where x²=12m +r, m odd, and r=x² mod12.Let me try m=1 (smallest odd number). Then x²=12*1 +r. But x²=12 +r. Since r=x² mod12, so r=(12 +r) mod12 =&gt; r= r mod12. Which is always true, but x²=12 +r, and r must be1,4,9. So:If r=1: x²=13. Not a square.If r=4: x²=16. x=4. Then m=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1, which is odd. So x=4.Wait, x=4. Let&#39;s check this.x=4 cows. Sold at x=4 dollars per cow. Total money:4*4=16 dollars.Buy sheep at12 dollars each:16 /12=1 with remainder4. So they can buy1 sheep and use the remaining4 dollars to buy a lamb. So total animals:1 sheep +1 lamb=2 animals. Dividing equally, each gets1 animal. So one gets the sheep, the other gets the lamb. The value: sheep is12, lamb is4. So the person with the lamb is shortchanged by12 -4=8 dollars. Therefore, the harmonica must be worth8 dollars? But according to our formula earlier, harmonica worth is(12 - r)/2=(12 -4)/2=4. Wait, but the difference is8, so to equalize, harmonica should be4?Wait, let&#39;s check.Total value is16. Each should get8. The person with the sheep has12, the person with the lamb has4. To equalize, the person with the sheep needs to give4 to the person with the lamb. Therefore, the harmonica is worth4. So in this case, the harmonica is worth4 dollars.But x=4: wait, when they sold4 cows at4 dollars each, got16 dollars. Bought1 sheep for12, remaining4 dollars bought a lamb. Then divided the flock:1 sheep and1 lamb. So each man gets one animal. But they have different values. The harmonica is given by the one with the sheep to the one with the lamb to make up the difference. The difference is12 -4=8. To make it equal, the one with the sheep gives4 dollars worth (the harmonica) to the one with the lamb. So harmonica is worth4.But in this case, x=4 is a valid solution. However, when we looked at quadratic residues earlier, x=4: x²=16≡4 mod12. So r=4, y=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1, which is odd. So y=1 is odd. Therefore, total animals y +1=2, which is even. So this works. So x=4 is a valid solution. Therefore, the harmonica is worth4 dollars.But is this the only solution? Let&#39;s check m=3 (next odd). Then x²=12*3 +r=36 +r. x²=36 +r. r must be1,4,9.If r=1: x²=37. Not a square.r=4: x²=40. Not a square.r=9: x²=45. Not a square.m=5: x²=60 +r.r=1:61 nope.r=4:64. x=8.Check x=8:x=8 cows, sold at8 dollars each: total64 dollars.Buy sheep at12 dollars:64 /12=5*12=60, remainder4. So buy5 sheep, use4 dollars for a lamb. Total animals5 +1=6. Divided equally, each gets3 animals. So one person gets3 sheep, value3*12=36. The other person gets2 sheep and1 lamb, value2*12 +4=24 +4=28. Difference36 -28=8. To equalize, the difference is8, so harmonica should be4.Wait, but according to the formula earlier, harmonica worth is(12 -r)/2=(12 -4)/2=4. So harmonica is4. But in this case, x=8: x²=64. 64 mod12 is4. So r=4. Therefore, same as x=4. So harmonica is also4. Therefore, regardless of x, as long as r=4, harmonica is4.Similarly, let&#39;s try x=10: x=10 cows, sold at10 dollars each:100 dollars.Buy sheep:100 /12=8*12=96, remainder4. So buy8 sheep, lamb4. Total animals8 +1=9. Wait, 9 is odd. Can&#39;t divide equally. So x=10 is invalid. Because y=8 is even, y +1=9, which is odd. So x=10 is not a solution.Wait, but x=8: y=5 sheep, which is odd? Wait, no, y=5. Wait, x=8: x²=64=12y +r. y=(64 -4)/12=60/12=5. So y=5 is odd. Therefore, total animals y +1=6, which is even. So x=8 is valid.Therefore, for x=4 and x=8, we get valid solutions where r=4, and the harmonica is worth4 dollars. Similarly, x=12k +4 or x=12k +8 might also work, but the harmonica value remains4.Is there a case where r=9?Let&#39;s check m=3: x²=36 +9=45, not a square.m=5: x²=60 +9=69, not a square.m=7: x²=84 +9=93, nope.m=9: x²=108 +9=117, nope.So no x with r=9 gives a square.Similarly for r=1.Thus, the only possible solutions are when r=4, which gives x=4,8, etc., and the harmonica is worth4 dollars. Therefore, the answer is4 dollars.But wait, in the first case with x=4, the harmonica is4, and in the case x=8, the harmonica is also4. So regardless of x, if r=4, the harmonica is4. Therefore, the harmonica is worth4 dollars.But let me check another x= 12k +4. Let&#39;s try k=1: x=16.x=16 cows, sold at16 dollars each:256 dollars.Buy sheep:256/12=21*12=252, remainder4. So buy21 sheep, lamb4. Total animals22. Divided into11 each. Person A gets11 sheep, person B gets10 sheep and1 lamb. Wait, no: total animals21 +1=22. Each gets11. So since there&#39;s only1 lamb, one person gets the lamb and10 sheep, the other gets11 sheep. Value of person A:10*12 +4=124. Value of person B:11*12=132. Difference is8. So harmonica is4.Yes, same as before. So regardless of x, when r=4, harmonica=4.Therefore, the answer is4 dollars.But let me check another r. Suppose r=9. If x=3: x²=9. Total money9. Buy sheep at12: can&#39;t buy any. Then use9 to buy a lamb. But the problem says they used the remaining money to buy a lamb after buying sheep. So if they can&#39;t buy any sheep, the problem is invalid. Therefore, x=3 is invalid.Similarly, x=5: x²=25. 25 divided by12 is2 with remainder1. So buy2 sheep, and1 lamb. Total animals3. Can&#39;t divide equally. So invalid.x=7:49 divided by12 is4 with remainder1. Total animals5. Can&#39;t divide. Invalid.x=2:4. 4 divided by12 is0 with remainder4. So buy0 sheep and1 lamb. Total animals1. Can&#39;t divide. Invalid.x=6:36. 36 divided by12=3. No remainder. So they don&#39;t buy a lamb. But the problem says they do buy a lamb. So invalid.x=9:81. 81 divided by12=6*12=72, remainder9. Buy6 sheep and1 lamb. Total animals7. Can&#39;t divide. Invalid.x=10:100. 100 divided by12=8*12=96, remainder4. Buy8 sheep and1 lamb. Total9 animals. Can&#39;t divide. Wait, but x=10, x²=100: r=4. y=(100 -4)/12=96/12=8. y=8 is even. Then total animals=8 +1=9, which is odd. Can&#39;t divide. Therefore, invalid. Wait, but earlier when x=8, x²=64, r=4, y=(64 -4)/12=60/12=5. y=5 is odd. So total animals=6, which is even. Therefore, x=8 is valid, but x=10 is invalid. Hmm. So x=8 is valid, x=4 is valid, x=16 is valid (y=21, which is odd), etc. So the pattern is x=4,8,16, etc.?Wait, x=16: x²=256. 256 divided by12=21*12=252, remainder4. y=21. 21 is odd. Total animals22, even. So valid. Therefore, harmonica=4 in all these cases.Therefore, the answer is4. So the harmonica is worth4 dollars.Final AnswerThe harmonica is worth boxed{4} dollars.&lt;/think&gt;The two men jointly owned ( x ) cows, which they sold for ( x ) dollars each, resulting in a total of ( x^2 ) dollars. They used this money to buy sheep at 12 dollars per head. Since the proceeds from the sale did not divide evenly by 12, they had a remainder ( r ) which was used to buy a lamb. The total number of animals bought was ( y + 1 ), where ( y ) is the number of sheep and ( r ) is the remainder. They divided the flock such that each man had the same number of animals, leading to a shortfall for the man with the lamb. To equalize the value, the second man gave the first man a harmonica.Key steps:1. Total money from selling cows: ( x^2 ).2. Bought ( y ) sheep at 12 dollars each, with remainder ( r ): ( x^2 = 12y + r ).3. Total animals: ( y + 1 ), which must be even, so ( y ) is odd.4. The value difference between the two men is ( 12 - r ).5. To equalize the value, the harmonica must be worth half the difference: ( frac{12 - r}{2} ).By analyzing quadratic residues modulo 12, the possible remainders ( r ) are 1, 4, or 9. Testing these values, we find that when ( r = 4 ), the quotient ( y ) is odd, leading to a valid solution. For example, ( x = 4 ) results in ( x^2 = 16 ), yielding ( y = 1 ) (odd) and ( r = 4 ). The harmonica&#39;s value is ( frac{12 - 4}{2} = 4 ).Thus, the harmonica is worth (boxed{4}) dollars.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. So, two men together own x cows. They sold each cow for x dollars, so total money they made would be x cows multiplied by x dollars per cow. That means they got x² dollars in total. Right?Then, with that money, they bought sheep at 12 dollars per head. But the problem says the proceeds didn&#39;t divide evenly by 12, so they had some leftover money. That leftover money was used to buy a lamb. So, the total amount they spent is x² dollars, which is equal to 12 times the number of sheep plus the cost of the lamb. But we don&#39;t know the price of the lamb yet. Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t mention the price of the lamb. Hmm, maybe we need to figure that out?Wait, no. Let me read again. They bought sheep at 12 dollars a head. Since the total money didn&#39;t divide by 12, the remaining money was used to buy a lamb. So, the remainder after dividing x² by 12 is the cost of the lamb. So, the lamb costs x² mod 12 dollars. Because when you divide x² by 12, the remainder is the amount left after buying as many sheep as possible, which is then used for the lamb. So, the lamb&#39;s price is x² mod 12. But since lamb is a single animal, maybe the remainder is the price? But lambs probably aren&#39;t sold for like 1 or 2. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the lamb&#39;s price, so maybe it&#39;s just the remainder. Let&#39;s assume that.So, total animals bought: (x² - (x² mod 12))/12 sheep plus 1 lamb. So total number of animals is (x² - (x² mod 12))/12 + 1. Then they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. Since there are two men, the total number of animals must be even? Wait, but (x² - (x² mod 12))/12 +1 might be even or odd. But the problem says they divided the flock so that each had the same number of animals. Therefore, the total number of animals must be even, so each gets half. But if the total is odd, they can&#39;t divide it equally. Wait, but the problem says they used the remaining money to buy a lamb, then divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. The man with the lamb was shortchanged, so the other guy gave him a harmonica. Hmm, maybe the total number of animals is even? Wait, but if they have a lamb, maybe there&#39;s an odd number? Wait, no. Let&#39;s parse again.They bought as many sheep as possible with x² dollars, which is (x² - r)/12 sheep, where r is the remainder. Then with the remaining r dollars, they bought a lamb. So total animals: (x² - r)/12 sheep + 1 lamb. The total number of animals is (x² - r)/12 +1. Then they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. So, total animals must be even? Because you can divide them equally between two people. Wait, but if (x² - r)/12 +1 is even, then each gets half. But if it&#39;s odd, they can&#39;t divide it equally. However, the problem says they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals. So maybe the total number of animals is even. But then the lamb must have made the total even? Hmm, but how?Alternatively, perhaps the lamb is considered an animal, so if the number of sheep is S, then total animals are S + 1. They need to split S +1 animals. To split equally, S +1 must be even. So S +1 is even, which implies S is odd. So the number of sheep S is odd. Then each person gets (S +1)/2 animals. But since S is odd, (S +1)/2 is an integer. So each person gets (S +1)/2 animals. But how is the lamb divided? Wait, the lamb is a single animal. So, if you have S sheep and 1 lamb, total S +1 animals. If S is odd, then S +1 is even, so each person gets (S +1)/2 animals. But one person would get the lamb and (S)/2 sheep, and the other person would get (S +1)/2 sheep. But since a lamb is different from a sheep, the person with the lamb has one less sheep. But the problem says the man with the lamb was somewhat shortchanged, so to make up for it, the second man gave him his harmonica. So, the harmonica&#39;s value should compensate for the difference between having a lamb and a sheep?Wait, maybe the harmonica&#39;s value is equal to the difference in value between a sheep and a lamb. But we know a sheep is 12 dollars. How much is the lamb? The lamb was bought with the remaining money, which is x² mod 12 dollars. So the lamb&#39;s cost is r = x² mod 12. Then, the total flock is S sheep and 1 lamb, where S = (x² - r)/12. Then, when they divide the flock, each person should get S/2 sheep and half a lamb? But they can&#39;t split the lamb. Wait, no. Since S +1 is even, each person gets (S +1)/2 animals. But since there&#39;s only one lamb, one person gets the lamb plus (S +1)/2 -1 sheep, and the other person gets (S +1)/2 sheep. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Let&#39;s think.Total animals: S sheep +1 lamb. Total is S +1. Divided equally, each person gets (S +1)/2 animals. So, one person would have (S +1)/2 sheep and the other person would have (S +1)/2 -1 sheep plus the lamb. Wait, no, how is that possible?Wait, maybe the lamb is considered as an animal, so when dividing, one person gets the lamb and some sheep, and the other person gets the remaining sheep. But since they have to have the same number of animals, the person with the lamb would have one less sheep. For example, if there are S sheep and 1 lamb, total S +1 animals. Each should get (S +1)/2 animals. So, if S is odd, then (S +1)/2 is an integer. Let&#39;s say S = 5. Then total animals = 6. Each person gets 3 animals. One person could get 2 sheep and 1 lamb, and the other gets 3 sheep. Wait, but that&#39;s not equal in value. The person with the lamb has a lamb worth r dollars and 2 sheep worth 24 dollars, and the other person has 3 sheep worth 36 dollars. So the difference is 36 - (24 + r) = 12 - r. So to make it fair, the person who got more value should give the other person something worth half the difference? Wait, the problem says the man with the lamb was shortchanged, so the other man gave him his harmonica. So the harmonica&#39;s value should compensate for the difference.So the value difference between the two shares is (value of the sheep the second man has) - (value of the lamb and sheep the first man has). Let&#39;s compute that. Let me define variables:Total money from cows: x² dollars.Number of sheep: S = floor(x² /12)Number of lamb: 1, costing r = x² mod 12.Total value: S*12 + r = x².Now, when they divide the flock, each gets (S +1)/2 animals. Since S is odd (because S +1 is even), (S +1)/2 is integer. Let&#39;s say S = 2k +1. Then each person gets k +1 animals.So, one person gets k +1 sheep, and the other person gets k sheep and 1 lamb. Wait, no. Wait, there are S = 2k +1 sheep and 1 lamb. Total animals: 2k + 2. Each person gets k +1 animals.So, how are the animals divided? Let&#39;s say person A gets k +1 sheep, and person B gets k sheep and 1 lamb. Then, the value for person A is (k +1)*12. The value for person B is k*12 + r. The difference is (k +1)*12 - (k*12 + r) = 12 - r. So person A has 12 - r more dollars than person B. Therefore, to make it equal, person A should give person B half of the difference? Wait, but the problem says the man with the lamb (person B) was shortchanged, so person A (the one without the lamb) gives him his harmonica to make up for it. Therefore, the harmonica must be worth half the difference? Because the difference is 12 - r, and to equalize, person A needs to transfer (12 - r)/2 to person B. So the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2.But r is equal to x² mod 12. So, we need to find x such that x² mod 12 = r. Then the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2. But since x is the number of cows, which is an integer. So, x² mod 12 can be?Possible squares modulo 12:Let&#39;s compute squares mod 12:0²=0 mod121²=12²=43²=94²=16≡45²=25≡16²=36≡07²=49≡18²=64≡49²=81≡910²=100≡411²=121≡1So the possible residues are 0,1,4,9.But in the problem, the proceeds did not divide by 12, so x² mod12 ≠0. Therefore, x² mod12 can be 1,4, or9. So r ∈ {1,4,9}.Therefore, harmonica value is (12 - r)/2. So:If r=1, harmonica is (12 -1)/2=11/2=5.5 dollars.If r=4, harmonica is (12-4)/2=4 dollars.If r=9, harmonica is (12-9)/2=1.5 dollars.But the problem is asking for how much the harmonica is worth, so we need to find a numerical answer. Therefore, x must be determined such that x² mod12 is 1,4, or9. However, the problem does not give specific numbers. Wait, but the answer is likely to be the same regardless of x, because it&#39;s a puzzle and the answer is fixed. Wait, but how?Wait, maybe we need to express the harmonica&#39;s value in terms of x? But the problem doesn&#39;t mention x. Wait, but the problem says &quot;how much is the harmonica worth?&quot; implying a numerical answer. Therefore, maybe regardless of x, the value is always 6 dollars? Wait, but from our previous calculation, it depends on r. Hmm. So, maybe there&#39;s a standard answer here. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the difference is 12 - r. Let&#39;s re-examine. If person A has (k +1) sheep, which is (k +1)*12 dollars. Person B has k sheep and 1 lamb, which is k*12 + r. The difference is (k +1)*12 - (k*12 + r) = 12 - r. Therefore, person A has 12 - r more. To equalize, person A should give person B half of that difference, which is (12 - r)/2. Therefore, the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2. Since r is x² mod12, and x² mod12 can be 1,4,9. Then harmonica can be 11/2=5.5, 4, or 1.5. But these are fractions. However, harmonica&#39;s worth should be a whole number, as it&#39;s an item. So, perhaps there&#39;s something wrong here.Wait, maybe the difference is actually (12 - r) dollars, but since the lamb is worth r dollars, and a sheep is 12, the person with the lamb is shortchanged by (12 - r) dollars. Therefore, to compensate, the harmonica should be worth (12 - r) dollars. But why did we split it?Wait, no. Because when they divided the flock, each had the same number of animals. So, each has (S +1)/2 animals. But the person with the lamb has one lamb worth r and ( (S +1)/2 -1 ) sheep. The other person has (S +1)/2 sheep. So the difference in value is [ (S +1)/2 *12 ] - [ ( (S +1)/2 -1 )*12 + r ].Compute that:First term: ( (S +1)/2 )*12Second term: ( (S +1)/2 -1 )*12 + rDifference: [ (S +1)/2 *12 ] - [ ( (S +1)/2 -1 )*12 + r ] = 12*( (S +1)/2 - ( (S +1)/2 -1 )) - r = 12*(1) - r = 12 - r.So the difference is indeed 12 - r. Therefore, the harmonica needs to compensate for this difference, so the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2, because the total difference is 12 - r, so transferring half of that from the person with more to the person with less would equalize their amounts. Therefore, the harmonica is worth (12 - r)/2.But since r is x² mod12, which is 1,4, or9. So:If r=1, harmonica= (12-1)/2=5.5If r=4, harmonica= (12-4)/2=4If r=9, harmonica=(12-9)/2=1.5But 5.5, 4, or1.5. However, in the problem statement, is there a way to figure out what r is? The problem states &quot;the proceeds from the sale of the cows did not divide by 12&quot;, so x² is not divisible by12. Therefore, possible residues are 1,4,9 as we saw.But maybe in the context of the problem, the answer is 6 dollars? Wait, but how?Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of x, the harmonica is worth 6. Wait, but according to our calculations, it&#39;s variable. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Let&#39;s pick x=5 cows. Then x²=25. 25 divided by12 is 2*12=24, remainder1. So lamb costs 1. Then total animals: 2 sheep +1 lamb=3 animals. Wait, no, 25 dollars: 2 sheep (24 dollars) +1 lamb (1 dollar). Total animals=3. Divided equally: each gets 1.5 animals? That&#39;s impossible. Wait, no, 25/12=2 with remainder1. So total animals is 2 +1=3. But you can&#39;t divide 3 animals equally. Wait, that contradicts the problem statement. The problem says they divided the flock so each had the same number of animals.Therefore, our previous assumption that S +1 is even must hold. Therefore, in the example, x=5 gives S=2, so S +1=3, which is odd. So this contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, x must be such that S +1 is even. But S = floor(x² /12). So S +1 even implies floor(x² /12) is odd. Therefore, x² /12 is not integer (since they have a remainder r), but floor(x² /12) is odd. Therefore, x² must be congruent to 1,4, or9 mod12, and floor(x² /12) must be odd.Let&#39;s take x=7. x²=49. 49 divided by12 is 4 with remainder1. So S=4, which is even. Then S +1=5, which is odd. So they can&#39;t divide 5 animals equally. So this x=7 is invalid.Wait, maybe x=1. x²=1. 1 divided by12 is 0 with remainder1. S=0, which is even. S +1=1, which is odd. Not possible.x=2. x²=4. 4/12=0 with remainder4. S=0, S +1=1. Odd. Not good.x=3. x²=9. 9/12=0 remainder9. S=0, S +1=1. Still odd.x=4. x²=16. 16/12=1 remainder4. S=1, which is odd. S +1=2. So total animals 2. Divided equally: each gets1 animal. So one person gets1 sheep, the other gets1 lamb. The lamb cost4 dollars, the sheep cost12. So difference is12 -4=8. So harmonica should be worth (12 -4)/2=4. So harmonica is4 dollars.But x=4. Let&#39;s check:Two men owned4 cows, sold each for4 dollars, total16 dollars. Bought sheep at12 dollars:16/12=1 sheep, remainder4. So bought1 sheep and1 lamb (cost4). Total animals:2. Each gets1 animal. So one gets a sheep (12 dollars), the other a lamb (4 dollars). The difference is8. To make up for it, the one with the sheep gives the harmonica worth4. So harmonica is4.Alternatively, x=5. x²=25. 25/12=2, remainder1. S=2, S +1=3. Can&#39;t split.x=7:49/12=4, r=1. S=4, S +1=5. Can&#39;t split.x=6: x²=36. 36 divisible by12. But the problem says proceeds did not divide by12. So x=6 is invalid.x=11:121/12=10, r=1. S=10, S +1=11. Odd. Can&#39;t split.x=10:100/12=8, r=4. S=8, S +1=9. Odd. Can&#39;t split.x=8:64/12=5, r=4. S=5, S +1=6. Even. So total animals=6. Each gets3. So person A gets3 sheep, person B gets2 sheep and1 lamb. Value: A=3*12=36, B=2*12 +4=28. Difference=8. Therefore, harmonica worth4.x=9:81/12=6, r=9. S=6, S +1=7. Odd.x=10:100/12=8, r=4. S +1=9. Odd.x=11:121/12=10, r=1. S +1=11. Odd.x=12:144/12=12. But proceeds divide by12, so invalid.x=13:169/12=14, r=1. S=14, S +1=15. Odd.x=14:196/12=16, r=4. S +1=17. Odd.x=15:225/12=18, r=9. S +1=19. Odd.x=16:256/12=21, r=4. S +1=22. Even. So total animals22. Each gets11. Person A:11 sheep. Person B:10 sheep +1 lamb. Value A=11*12=132. B=10*12 +4=124. Difference=8. So harmonica=4.So when x=4,8,16, etc., where x is even and x² mod12=4, then S is odd (since x²=12k +4, so S=k= (x² -4)/12. For x even, like x=4: (16-4)/12=1, which is odd. x=8: (64-4)/12=60/12=5, odd. x=16: (256-4)/12=252/12=21, odd. So S is odd. Then S +1 is even. So total animals even. Then when dividing, one person gets (S +1)/2 sheep, which is (odd +1)/2= (even)/2= integer. The other gets (S -1)/2 sheep +1 lamb. The value difference is 12 - r=12 -4=8. So harmonica worth4.Similarly, if x² mod12=1, then r=1. Then S=(x² -1)/12. For example, x=5:25-1=24, 24/12=2, which is even. Then S +1=3, which is odd. Not allowed. So x must be such that S is odd. Wait, when x² mod12=1, S=(x² -1)/12. For x²=1,13,25, etc. Let&#39;s take x=7:49. 49 mod12=1. So S=(49-1)/12=48/12=4, which is even. S +1=5, odd. Not allowed. Similarly, x=11:121. S=(121-1)/12=120/12=10, even. S +1=11, odd. Not allowed. So when x² mod12=1, S is even, so S +1 is odd. Not allowed. Similarly, for r=9.Take x=3:9. 9 mod12=9. S=(9-9)/12=0. S +1=1. Odd. Not allowed.x=9:81. 81 mod12=9. S=(81-9)/12=72/12=6. S=6, even. S +1=7. Odd. Not allowed.x=15:225. 225 mod12=9. S=(225 -9)/12=216/12=18. S=18, even. S +1=19. Odd. Not allowed.So the only case when S +1 is even is when r=4. Then S=(x² -4)/12. For x even, x=4,8,16, etc., S=(16-4)/12=1, (64-4)/12=5, (256-4)/12=21. S is odd. So S +1=2,6,22, which are even. Thus, in these cases, we can divide the flock into two equal parts. So the harmonica is worth(12 -4)/2=4.Therefore, regardless of x (as long as x is even and x² mod12=4), the harmonica is worth4 dollars. But how do we know x is even? Because if x is even, x² is divisible by4. Since x² mod12=4, 4 is divisible by4, so possible. If x is odd, x² mod12=1 or9, which aren&#39;t divisible by4, so not possible. Therefore, x must be even. Therefore, the harmonica is worth4 dollars.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify x. So the answer must be a fixed number. From our deduction, since the only possible residue that allows splitting is r=4, then harmonica=4 dollars. So the answer is4.&lt;/think&gt;The two men sold ( x ) cows at ( x ) dollars each, earning ( x^2 ) dollars. They bought sheep at 12 each, but since ( x^2 ) wasn&#39;t divisible by 12, they used the remainder to buy a lamb. Let ( r = x^2 mod 12 ), which is the cost of the lamb. The total flock includes ( frac{x^2 - r}{12} ) sheep and 1 lamb. To divide equally, the total number of animals ( frac{x^2 - r}{12} + 1 ) must be even. This implies ( frac{x^2 - r}{12} ) is odd. Analyzing possible residues modulo 12, only ( r = 4 ) satisfies the conditions (as ( x ) must be even to ensure ( x^2 equiv 4 mod 12 )). The value difference between a sheep (12) and the lamb (4) is ( 12 - 4 = 8 ). To equalize, the harmonica&#39;s value is half this difference: ( frac{8}{2} = 4 ).Answer: The harmonica is worth boxed{4} dollars.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb740fc7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>🔑:</span>Solution. The revenue from sales equals x^{2} dollars. If x were divisible by 6, then x^{2} would be divisible by 36, and consequently, by 12. Since this is not the case, x is not divisible by 6. In this case, x=12 k+r, where |r|=1,2,3,4 or 5. Accordingly,frac{x^{2}}{12}=frac{(12 k+r)^{2}}{12}=frac{144 k^{2}+24 k r+r^{2}}{12}=12 k^{2}+2 k r+frac{r^{2}}{12}Now, since both people have the same number of animals, the total number of animals is even, which means there is an odd number of sheep and one lamb. Therefore, the quotient of dividing the number x^{2} by 12, which equals the number of sheep bought for x^{2} dollars, must be an odd number. But 12 k^{2}+2 k r is an even number. Therefore, the number r^{2} / 12 must contribute an odd value to the quotient. This implies that r^{2} must exceed 12, leading to |r|=4 or 5. For |r|=5 we havefrac{r^{2}}{12}=frac{25}{12}=2+frac{1}{12}80giving an even number as the contribution to the quotient. Therefore, |r| must be 4 and r^{2}=16. Thus,frac{r^{2}}{12}=frac{16}{12}=1+frac{4}{12}and the remainder is 4 (not -4). Therefore, the lamb costs 4 dollars. Consequently, one person had a 4-dollar lamb, and the other had a 12-dollar sheep, and the transfer of a 4-dollar harmonica would bring each of them to a level of 8 dollars.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-3af692d8 data-v-cb740fc7><div class="review" data-v-cb740fc7><div class="review-title" data-v-cb740fc7><span class="icon" data-v-cb740fc7>❓:</span>Problem 5.

First, I need to make sure I understand the setup. There&#39;s a figure with three squares: the largest one is ABCD, then there&#39;s a middle square whose vertices are the midpoints of ABCD&#39;s sides, and the smallest square is probably inside the middle one. The shaded area is between the middle and the smallest square. The problem states that the sum of the perimeters of the smallest and largest square is 60 cm. Also, the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square. We need to find the area of the shaded part, which is between the middle and the smallest square.Let me parse this information. First, let&#39;s note that the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. So if I let the side length of the largest square be &#39;a&#39;, then its perimeter is 4a. Similarly, the smallest square&#39;s side length would be &#39;c&#39;, so its perimeter is 4c. The problem says that the sum of these perimeters is 60 cm, so:4a + 4c = 60It also says that the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than that of the largest. That wording is a bit tricky. If something is four times smaller, does that mean it&#39;s 1/4 the size? So, perimeter of smallest = (perimeter of largest)/4. So:4c = (4a)/4Which simplifies to:4c = aSo, c = a/4So, the perimeter of the smallest square is a, and the side length is a/4. Then, substituting back into the first equation:4a + 4*(a/4) = 60Simplify:4a + a = 60So 5a = 60, which gives a = 12 cm.Therefore, the side length of the largest square is 12 cm. Then the side length of the smallest square is 12/4 = 3 cm. So its perimeter is 4*3 = 12 cm, and the largest is 4*12 = 48 cm, and indeed 48 + 12 = 60, which matches the given sum.Now, we need to find the area of the shaded part, which is between the middle square and the smallest square. So, first, we need to figure out the side length of the middle square.The middle square has its vertices at the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD. So, let&#39;s recall that if you connect the midpoints of a square, the resulting figure is another square, rotated by 45 degrees, and its side length is half the diagonal of the original square. Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s think carefully.Original square ABCD with side length a = 12 cm. The midpoints of its sides are connected to form the middle square. So, each vertex of the middle square is the midpoint of ABCD&#39;s sides.Let me visualize this. Let&#39;s say square ABCD has coordinates (0,0), (12,0), (12,12), (0,12). The midpoints of the sides would be at (6,0), (12,6), (6,12), (0,6). Connecting these midpoints would form a square rotated 45 degrees relative to ABCD.To find the side length of this middle square, let&#39;s compute the distance between two adjacent midpoints. For example, from (6,0) to (12,6). The distance between these two points is sqrt[(12-6)^2 + (6-0)^2] = sqrt[36 + 36] = sqrt[72] = 6*sqrt(2). Therefore, the side length of the middle square is 6*sqrt(2) cm.Wait, but the original square has side length 12 cm, so half of that is 6 cm. The distance between midpoints is sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) = 6*sqrt(2), yes. So the middle square has side length 6*sqrt(2) cm. Then, the area of the middle square is (6*sqrt(2))^2 = 36*2 = 72 cm².The smallest square has a side length of 3 cm, so its area is 3^2 = 9 cm². Therefore, the shaded area between the middle and smallest square would be 72 - 9 = 63 cm²? Wait, but that seems straightforward. But let me check if that&#39;s correct.Wait, but maybe the smallest square is not inside the middle square. Wait, the problem says &quot;the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square.&quot; Hmm. Maybe the shaded area is the area between the middle square and the smallest square. But according to the problem, the figure is made up of three squares. So, the largest is ABCD, then the middle one is connected to it via midpoints, and the smallest square is inside the middle one. So, if the shaded area is between the middle and smallest square, then yes, subtracting their areas gives the shaded region.But wait, is the smallest square inside the middle square? If the middle square is formed by connecting midpoints of ABCD, then the smallest square must be another square inside that middle square. How is the smallest square positioned? The problem says the middle square&#39;s vertices are midpoints of ABCD. The smallest square is probably formed by connecting midpoints of the middle square?But in that case, the side length of the smallest square would be half the diagonal of the middle square divided by 2? Wait, let&#39;s think.Wait, if the middle square has side length 6*sqrt(2) cm, then if we connect the midpoints of the middle square, that would form another square. The distance between midpoints of the middle square would be similar to the calculation we did before. The middle square is rotated 45 degrees, so its sides are diagonals of the original coordinate system. Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the middle square is a square with side length 6*sqrt(2), which is rotated 45 degrees relative to ABCD. So, the distance from the center to each vertex is 6*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 6 cm. Wait, that might not be helpful.Alternatively, maybe the smallest square is the one that is formed by connecting midpoints of the middle square, similar to how the middle square was formed from ABCD. Let me try that.If the middle square has side length 6*sqrt(2) cm, then its midpoints would be located halfway along each side. So, each side of the middle square is 6*sqrt(2) cm. The midpoint divides it into two segments of 3*sqrt(2) cm each. If we connect these midpoints, we form another square. Let&#39;s compute the side length of this new square.If the original middle square is a square with side length s = 6*sqrt(2). The coordinates of the middle square can be considered as a rotated square. Let me assign coordinates for clarity. Let’s suppose the middle square is centered at (6,6) in the original coordinate system. Its vertices are at (6,0), (12,6), (6,12), and (0,6). So, each side of the middle square is from (6,0) to (12,6). The midpoint of that side would be at (9,3). Similarly, the midpoint of the next side from (12,6) to (6,12) would be at (9,9), and so on.Connecting these midpoints (9,3), (9,9), (3,9), (3,3) would form a square. Let&#39;s compute the distance between (9,3) and (9,9). That&#39;s a vertical line, length 6 cm. Wait, but that can&#39;t be a square. Wait, no. Wait, if we connect the midpoints of the middle square&#39;s sides, which is a rotated square, would the resulting figure be a square?Wait, maybe my coordinate system is confusing. Let me try to parametrize this differently. Let&#39;s consider the middle square as a square rotated 45 degrees with side length 6*sqrt(2). The coordinates of its vertices can be considered as (6,0), (12,6), (6,12), (0,6). Now, the midpoints of its sides would be halfway between these vertices.So, the first side is from (6,0) to (12,6). The midpoint is at ((6+12)/2, (0+6)/2) = (9,3). The next side is from (12,6) to (6,12), midpoint at ((12+6)/2, (6+12)/2) = (9,9). Then from (6,12) to (0,6), midpoint at (3,9), and from (0,6) to (6,0), midpoint at (3,3). So connecting (9,3), (9,9), (3,9), (3,3) forms another square. Let&#39;s check the distance between (9,3) and (9,9): that&#39;s 6 units. Then from (9,9) to (3,9): that&#39;s also 6 units. So this is a square aligned with the original coordinate system, side length 6 cm. Wait, but this seems like a square with side length 6 cm, centered at (6,6), same as the original middle square. Wait, but if that&#39;s the case, then the smallest square would have side length 6 cm. But according to the problem, the smallest square has a perimeter four times smaller than the largest, which was 12 cm. So perimeter 12 cm implies side length 3 cm, which contradicts this.Therefore, my previous assumption that the smallest square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the middle square must be wrong. So perhaps the problem&#39;s figure is different. Let me go back to the problem statement.&quot;The figure on the right consists of three squares. The vertices of the middle square are the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD. The sum of the perimeters of the smallest and the largest square is 60 cm and the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square. What is the area of the shaded part of the figure, i.e., the area of the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square?&quot;Wait, so there&#39;s square ABCD (largest), middle square with vertices at midpoints of ABCD, and the smallest square. The shaded area is between the middle and the smallest square. So maybe the smallest square is inside the middle square. How?If the middle square is formed by connecting the midpoints of ABCD, then perhaps the smallest square is the one formed by connecting the midpoints of the middle square. But according to the calculation above, that would give a square of side length 6 cm, which would have a perimeter of 24 cm, but according to the problem, the smallest square&#39;s perimeter is 12 cm (since largest is 48 cm). So that&#39;s inconsistent. Therefore, my approach must be incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the smallest square is not formed by connecting midpoints of the middle square. Maybe it&#39;s another square inside the middle square. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the three squares are arranged in some other configuration. The problem mentions a figure consisting of three squares, with the middle square&#39;s vertices at midpoints of the largest square. Maybe the smallest square is located in the corner? Wait, but the figure is bounded by the middle and the smallest square. Maybe the shaded area is between them, so overlapping or something. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the middle square and the smallest square are concentric, and the shaded area is the region between them. So the area would be the area of the middle square minus the area of the smallest square. But then we need to find the side length of the middle square. Wait, but we already found the largest square has side length 12 cm, the middle square (connecting midpoints) has side length 6*sqrt(2) cm as calculated earlier. The smallest square is 3 cm side length.Wait, but how is the smallest square positioned? If the shaded area is between the middle and smallest square, then the smallest square must be entirely within the middle square. But if the middle square has side length 6*sqrt(2) ≈ 8.485 cm, and the smallest square has side length 3 cm, then 3 cm is much smaller. So the area would be (6*sqrt(2))² - 3² = 72 - 9 = 63 cm². But let me verify if that&#39;s the case.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different relationship. The problem says &quot;the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square.&quot; So perhaps the shaded area is the overlapping region or the area between them. But if the smallest is entirely inside the middle, then it&#39;s just the middle minus the smallest.But let me confirm with the problem statement again. It says the figure consists of three squares. The middle square&#39;s vertices are the midpoints of ABCD. The smallest square&#39;s position is not specified, but since the shaded area is bounded by the middle and the smallest, they must be adjacent or overlapping. But in the initial figure (which we can&#39;t see), the common configuration is that when you connect midpoints of a square, you get a smaller square, and then perhaps the smallest square is even smaller inside. But according to the calculations, if the largest is 12 cm, middle is 6*sqrt(2) ≈ 8.485 cm, and smallest is 3 cm. Then 3 cm is much smaller. So the area between middle and smallest is 72 - 9 = 63. But maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation here.Wait, let me check the middle square&#39;s side length again. If the largest square ABCD has side length 12 cm, then the distance between midpoints (which are at 6 cm from each corner) is sqrt((6)^2 + (6)^2) = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2). Therefore, the middle square&#39;s side is 6*sqrt(2), so area is (6*sqrt(2))² = 72. The smallest square has area 3²=9. So 72 - 9 = 63. So the shaded area is 63 cm².But let me make sure that the smallest square is indeed inside the middle square. If the problem states that the figure is made of three squares, with the middle one connected to the largest, and the smallest somewhere. The shaded area is between the middle and smallest, so it&#39;s the area that&#39;s inside the middle but outside the smallest. Hence, subtraction.Alternatively, maybe the middle square and the smallest square are arranged such that the shaded area is more complex. But without the figure, it&#39;s hard to tell. However, given the problem states &quot;the area of the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square,&quot; which usually would imply the area between them, assuming one is inside the other. Since the smallest square is four times smaller in perimeter, which would make its side length four times smaller, so 12 cm vs 3 cm, as we found.But the middle square is of side length 6*sqrt(2), so approximately 8.485 cm, which is larger than 3 cm, so the smallest square could fit inside. Therefore, the shaded area would be 72 - 9 = 63. But let me check if the problem might have a different configuration.Wait, perhaps the side length of the middle square is different. Let me think again. If the largest square is 12 cm, then when connecting midpoints, the new square (middle) has vertices at the midpoints. The side length of the middle square can be found by the distance between two midpoints.Take square ABCD with side length 12. Let&#39;s assign coordinates: let’s place the square ABCD with coordinates A(0,0), B(12,0), C(12,12), D(0,12). The midpoints of the sides are:Midpoint of AB: (6,0)Midpoint of BC: (12,6)Midpoint of CD: (6,12)Midpoint of DA: (0,6)Connecting these midpoints in order forms the middle square. Let&#39;s compute the distance between (6,0) and (12,6):Distance = sqrt[(12 - 6)^2 + (6 - 0)^2] = sqrt[36 + 36] = sqrt[72] = 6*sqrt(2), which confirms the middle square&#39;s side length is 6*sqrt(2).Therefore, area is (6*sqrt(2))² = 72 cm².The smallest square has side length 3 cm, so area 9 cm².Therefore, shaded area = 72 - 9 = 63 cm².But let me check once more if the position of the smallest square is indeed inside the middle square. The problem states &quot;the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square,&quot; which usually implies the overlapping region or the area between them. If the smallest square is entirely within the middle square, then subtracting their areas gives the shaded region.Alternatively, maybe the smallest square is the one formed by connecting the midpoints of the middle square. Let&#39;s check that. If the middle square has side length 6*sqrt(2), then connecting its midpoints would create another square. Let&#39;s compute its side length.Midpoints of the middle square: Let&#39;s take the middle square with vertices at (6,0), (12,6), (6,12), (0,6). The midpoints of these sides would be:Between (6,0) and (12,6): midpoint is (9,3)Between (12,6) and (6,12): midpoint is (9,9)Between (6,12) and (0,6): midpoint is (3,9)Between (0,6) and (6,0): midpoint is (3,3)Connecting these midpoints (9,3), (9,9), (3,9), (3,3) forms a square. Let&#39;s compute the distance between (9,3) and (9,9): that&#39;s 6 units. Then between (9,9) and (3,9): also 6 units. So this is a square with side length 6 cm, aligned with the original coordinate system. Wait, so this square has side length 6 cm, which would have perimeter 24 cm. But according to the problem, the smallest square has perimeter 12 cm. Therefore, this cannot be the smallest square. So this suggests that the smallest square is not formed by connecting midpoints of the middle square. Hence, the previous conclusion that the smallest square is of side length 3 cm, area 9 cm², and the shaded area is 72 - 9 = 63 cm² must be correct.But let me think again. The problem says &quot;the sum of the perimeters of the smallest and the largest square is 60 cm&quot; and &quot;the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square.&quot; So we have:Perimeter largest + perimeter smallest = 60Perimeter smallest = (perimeter largest)/4So, perimeter largest = 4 * perimeter smallestThen, substituting:4 * perimeter smallest + perimeter smallest = 605 * perimeter smallest = 60perimeter smallest = 12 cmTherefore, perimeter largest = 48 cm, so side lengths are 12 cm and 3 cm, as before.Therefore, the area calculations proceed as before. The middle square has area 72 cm², smallest is 9 cm², shaded area 63 cm². Therefore, the answer should be 63 cm².Wait, but let me check once more if the middle square is indeed the one with side length 6*sqrt(2). Since when you connect midpoints of a square, the area of the resulting square is half of the original. Wait, original square area is 12² = 144 cm². Then connecting midpoints, the middle square has area 72 cm², which is half. So that&#39;s correct. So 72 cm² is half of 144, which is correct. Then the smallest square is 3 cm, area 9. So the shaded area is 72 - 9 = 63. Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the area of the shaded part is 63 cm².Final Answerboxed{63}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the area of the shaded part between the middle square and the smallest square. Here are the key steps:1. Identify the side lengths of the largest and smallest squares:   - Let the side length of the largest square (ABCD) be (a).   - The perimeter of the largest square is (4a).   - The perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller, so it is (frac{4a}{4} = a). Therefore, the side length of the smallest square is (frac{a}{4}).2. Set up the equation for the sum of perimeters:   - The sum of the perimeters of the largest and smallest squares is 60 cm:     [     4a + 4 left(frac{a}{4}right) = 60     ]   - Simplifying, we get:     [     4a + a = 60 implies 5a = 60 implies a = 12 text{ cm}     ]   - Therefore, the side length of the largest square is 12 cm, and the side length of the smallest square is (frac{12}{4} = 3) cm.3. Determine the side length of the middle square:   - The middle square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the largest square (ABCD).   - The distance between the midpoints of the sides of the largest square (which is the side length of the middle square) is calculated using the distance formula. For a square with side length 12 cm, the midpoints form a square with side length (6sqrt{2}) cm.4. Calculate the areas:   - The area of the middle square:     [     (6sqrt{2})^2 = 72 text{ cm}^2     ]   - The area of the smallest square:     [     3^2 = 9 text{ cm}^2     ]5. Find the shaded area:   - The shaded area is the difference between the area of the middle square and the area of the smallest square:     [     72 - 9 = 63 text{ cm}^2     ]Thus, the area of the shaded part of the figure is (boxed{63}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, there are three squares: the largest one is ABCD, then a middle square whose vertices are the midpoints of ABCD&#39;s sides, and the smallest square. The sum of the perimeters of the smallest and largest squares is 60 cm, and the perimeter of the smallest is four times smaller than the largest. We need to find the area of the shaded part, which is between the middle and smallest square.First, let&#39;s parse the information. The key points are:1. Three squares: largest (ABCD), middle, and smallest.2. Middle square&#39;s vertices are midpoints of ABCD&#39;s sides.3. Sum of perimeters of smallest and largest squares is 60 cm.4. Perimeter of smallest is four times smaller than the largest. So, if the largest&#39;s perimeter is P, the smallest is P/4.5. Need area between middle and smallest squares.Let me start by setting variables. Let&#39;s let the side length of the largest square ABCD be &#39;a&#39;. Then, its perimeter is 4a. The problem states that the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller, meaning it&#39;s (4a)/4 = a. Wait, hold on. The wording says &quot;the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square.&quot; Hmm, &quot;four times smaller&quot; is a bit ambiguous. In some contexts, it could mean 1/4 the size. So if the largest has perimeter P, the smallest has P/4. So sum of perimeters is P + P/4 = 5P/4 = 60 cm. Therefore, 5P/4 = 60 =&gt; P = 60*(4/5) = 48 cm. So the perimeter of the largest square is 48 cm, so its side length is 48/4 = 12 cm. Then the smallest square has perimeter 12 cm, so its side length is 12/4 = 3 cm.Wait, let me confirm. If the perimeter of the smallest is four times smaller, that should mean if the largest is P, the smallest is P/4. So sum is P + P/4 = 5P/4 = 60. Then 5P/4 = 60 =&gt; P = 60*(4/5) = 48. So yes, largest perimeter 48 cm, so side length 12 cm. Smallest perimeter 12 cm, side length 3 cm. That seems okay.Now, the middle square&#39;s vertices are the midpoints of the sides of ABCD. So, the middle square is formed by connecting the midpoints of the largest square. If we connect midpoints of a square, the resulting figure is another square, rotated 45 degrees, and its area is half of the original square. Wait, is that right?Let me recall: If you connect midpoints of a square&#39;s sides, the new square&#39;s side length can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Each side of the middle square is the distance between two midpoints. Let&#39;s say the original square has side length &#39;a&#39;. The distance between the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the next side is sqrt((a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2) = sqrt(a^2/4 + a^2/4) = sqrt(a^2/2) = a/√2. Therefore, the side length of the middle square is a/√2. Therefore, its perimeter is 4*(a/√2) = (4a)/√2 = 2√2 a. Wait, but in terms of the original square, the middle square has side length a/√2.But in our problem, the largest square has side length 12 cm, so the middle square would have side length 12/√2 = 6√2 cm. Then, the area of the middle square is (6√2)^2 = 36*2 = 72 cm². The smallest square has side length 3 cm, so its area is 9 cm². Then, the shaded area between the middle and smallest square would be 72 - 9 = 63 cm²? Wait, but that seems straightforward. But let me check again.Wait, maybe there is something wrong here. Because if the middle square is formed by connecting midpoints of the largest square, then the smallest square is inside the middle square. But the problem says the shaded part is bounded by the middle and the smallest square, so the area between them. So, subtract the area of the smallest from the middle.But let&#39;s confirm. Is the middle square indeed the one formed by connecting midpoints of ABCD? The problem says &quot;the vertices of the middle square are the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD.&quot; So yes, connecting midpoints of ABCD gives the middle square. Then the smallest square is inside that. But how is the smallest square positioned? The problem says &quot;the figure on the right consists of three squares.&quot; Since I can&#39;t see the figure, but according to the description, there are three squares: largest, middle (midpoints), and smallest.Wait, but if the middle square is formed by midpoints of the largest, then its side length is 12/√2 ≈ 8.485 cm. Then the smallest square must be inside the middle square. How is the smallest square placed? The problem doesn&#39;t specify, but perhaps the smallest square is similar, with its vertices at midpoints of the middle square? If that&#39;s the case, then the side length of the smallest square would be (12/√2)/√2 = 12/2 = 6 cm. But according to the problem, the smallest square&#39;s perimeter is 12 cm, so side length 3 cm, which contradicts that.Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong. Maybe the smallest square is not formed by connecting midpoints of the middle square, but is placed differently.Wait, let&#39;s go back. The problem states: &quot;the sum of the perimeters of the smallest and the largest square is 60 cm and the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square.&quot; So we have largest perimeter P, smallest perimeter P/4, sum 5P/4 = 60, so P = 48 cm, so largest square side length 12 cm, smallest perimeter 12 cm, so side length 3 cm.So regardless of how the squares are arranged, the side lengths are 12 cm, middle square (from midpoints) 12/√2 ≈ 8.485 cm, and smallest 3 cm. But the problem states that the shaded area is between the middle and smallest square, so area of middle minus area of smallest. If middle is 72 cm² and smallest is 9 cm², then shaded area is 63 cm². But that seems too straightforward. Maybe there&#39;s a catch here.Wait, perhaps the figure is not as straightforward as three concentric squares. Maybe the middle square is not the one formed by the midpoints, but actually another square? Wait, no, the problem says &quot;the vertices of the middle square are the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD.&quot; So the middle square is definitely formed by the midpoints, so its side length is 12/√2 cm, which is 6√2 cm, area 72 cm².But then the smallest square has side length 3 cm. How is it positioned inside the middle square? If the middle square is rotated 45 degrees relative to the largest square, then the smallest square might be aligned with the middle square or with the largest square.Wait, perhaps the smallest square is placed such that its vertices are midpoints of the middle square&#39;s sides? If that&#39;s the case, then the side length of the smallest square would be (6√2)/√2 = 6 cm. But that contradicts the given perimeter. So maybe not.Alternatively, maybe the smallest square is centered and aligned with the largest square. So, the middle square is rotated 45 degrees, and the smallest square is inside the middle square, but aligned with the original orientation.But in that case, how would the side length of the smallest square relate? If the middle square has side length 6√2, then the distance from the center to a vertex of the middle square is equal to half the diagonal of the middle square. Wait, the middle square&#39;s diagonal is 6√2 * √2 = 12 cm. So the distance from center to vertex (radius) is 6 cm.If the smallest square is aligned with the largest square and centered, then its diagonal cannot exceed the distance from the center to the middle square&#39;s side. Wait, maybe.Alternatively, perhaps the smallest square is such that it fits perfectly inside the middle square. If the middle square is rotated 45 degrees, the smallest square could be oriented the same as the largest square. The maximum square that can fit inside the middle square without rotating would have a side length equal to the side length of the middle square divided by √2. So 6√2 / √2 = 6 cm. But again, that contradicts the given side length of 3 cm.Alternatively, maybe the smallest square is placed in a corner of the middle square. But the problem mentions &quot;the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square,&quot; which implies that the smallest square is entirely within the middle square, and the shaded area is the region between them.Given that the smallest square has a much smaller side length (3 cm) compared to the middle square (6√2 ≈ 8.485 cm), the positioning might be such that the smallest square is centered inside the middle square.But even so, regardless of the positioning, the area between them would just be the difference of their areas. But if they are not concentric or aligned, maybe the area is different? But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify the exact positioning, probably the assumption is that the smallest square is centered inside the middle square, so the area would simply be the difference.But let&#39;s verify with numbers:- Largest square: side 12 cm, perimeter 48 cm.- Middle square: formed by midpoints of largest, side length 12/√2 = 6√2 ≈ 8.485 cm, area (6√2)^2 = 72 cm².- Smallest square: perimeter 12 cm, side length 3 cm, area 9 cm².Therefore, shaded area is 72 - 9 = 63 cm².But before finalizing, let me check if there&#39;s another interpretation. The problem says &quot;the sum of the perimeters of the smallest and the largest square is 60 cm&quot; and &quot;the perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller than the perimeter of the largest square.&quot;If &quot;four times smaller&quot; is interpreted as the smallest being 1/4 the size of the largest, so perimeter P_small = P_large / 4. Then, P_large + P_small = 60. So P_large + P_large/4 = 5P_large/4 = 60 =&gt; P_large = 48 cm, which gives side length 12 cm. Then P_small = 12 cm, side length 3 cm. So that&#39;s consistent.Then the middle square, formed by midpoints of the largest, has area 72 cm², smallest has 9 cm², so difference 63. Is there any reason this would be incorrect?Wait, maybe the middle square is not the one with vertices at midpoints? Wait, the problem says &quot;the vertices of the middle square are the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD.&quot; So yes, that&#39;s the middle square.Alternatively, maybe the middle square is a different square. Wait, but the figure consists of three squares. The largest, ABCD, the middle one with vertices at midpoints, and the smallest. The shaded area is between the middle and smallest.But if the middle square is formed by the midpoints, which gives area 72, and the smallest has area 9, the difference is 63. Unless the middle square is not that one. Wait, perhaps the middle square is between the largest and the smallest, but not the one formed by midpoints. Wait, the problem says &quot;the vertices of the middle square are the midpoints of the sides of square ABCD.&quot; So it&#39;s definitely that one.Alternatively, maybe the figure is constructed such that the smallest square is at the center, and the middle square is around it, but connected via midpoints. Wait, but connecting midpoints of the largest square would create the middle square, and then the smallest square is another one inside. But without seeing the figure, it&#39;s hard to tell. But given the description, I think the shaded area is simply the area between the middle square (72 cm²) and the smallest square (9 cm²), so 63 cm².But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the middle square&#39;s area. Let me check again.Original square ABCD has side length 12 cm. The middle square is formed by connecting midpoints. The distance between midpoints is sqrt((6)^2 + (6)^2) for adjacent midpoints? Wait, no. Wait, if you take a square ABCD, and take midpoints of each side, then connect them in order, you get a square rotated 45 degrees. The side length of that middle square can be calculated as follows: consider two adjacent midpoints. The distance between them is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length a/2 and a/2, where a is the side length of the original square. So distance is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 ) = sqrt( a²/4 + a²/4 ) = sqrt( a²/2 ) = a/√2.Therefore, the side length of the middle square is a/√2. For a = 12 cm, that&#39;s 12/√2 = 6√2 cm. Then, the area is (6√2)^2 = 36*2 = 72 cm². Correct.The smallest square has perimeter 12 cm, so side length 3 cm, area 9 cm². Therefore, the area between them is 72 - 9 = 63 cm². That seems right. But the answer seems straightforward, maybe I&#39;m missing something.Wait, the problem says &quot;the figure on the right consists of three squares.&quot; So maybe the three squares are arranged in a way that the middle and smallest are not concentric? For example, the middle square might be adjacent to the largest, and the smallest adjacent to the middle? But the problem states that the shaded area is bounded by the middle and smallest square, implying that one is inside the other. Also, the description mentions that the middle square&#39;s vertices are midpoints of the largest, so it&#39;s inside the largest.Therefore, the figure is likely the largest square, with the middle square inside it (connected by midpoints), and the smallest square inside the middle square, creating a shaded area between the middle and smallest. So, area is middle area minus smallest area, 72 - 9 = 63.But let me check once more. If the largest square has side 12, middle square side 6√2 ≈ 8.485, and smallest 3, then how does the smallest fit inside the middle? If the middle square is rotated 45 degrees, the side length is ~8.485 cm. If the smallest square is aligned with the largest, its diagonal would have to be less than the side length of the middle square. The diagonal of the smallest square is 3√2 ≈ 4.242 cm, which is less than 8.485, so it can fit inside. So if centered, the smallest square is inside the middle square, and the area between is 72 - 9 = 63.Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is a different shape, not just the simple difference. For example, if the smallest square is placed such that its corners touch the middle square&#39;s sides, forming another rotated square. But without the figure, it&#39;s hard to tell. However, the problem states &quot;the area of the figure bounded by the middle and the smallest square,&quot; which in most cases would be the area between them, hence subtraction.Therefore, I think the answer is 63 cm².Final Answerboxed{63}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to find the area of the shaded part between the middle and the smallest square. Here are the key steps:1. Identify the side lengths of the largest and smallest squares:   - Let the side length of the largest square (ABCD) be (a).   - The perimeter of the largest square is (4a).   - The perimeter of the smallest square is four times smaller, so it is (frac{4a}{4} = a).   - The sum of their perimeters is (60 , text{cm}), so (4a + a = 60 , text{cm}).   - Solving this, we get (5a = 60 , text{cm}) hence (a = 12 , text{cm}).   - Therefore, the side length of the largest square is (12 , text{cm}), and the side length of the smallest square is (3 , text{cm}) (since its perimeter is (12 , text{cm})).2.

I need to solve these two math problems. Hmm, starting with the first one: (sqrt(12) + sqrt(1 1/3)) multiplied by sqrt(3). Alright, let me break this down step by step.First, simplify sqrt(12). I know that 12 can be broken down into 4*3, and since 4 is a perfect square, sqrt(4*3) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(3) which is 2*sqrt(3). So sqrt(12) simplifies to 2√3. Got that part.Next, sqrt(1 1/3). Wait, 1 1/3 is a mixed number. Let me convert that to an improper fraction. 1 is 3/3, so 3/3 + 1/3 is 4/3. So sqrt(4/3). Hmm, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(3) is √3, so sqrt(4/3) is sqrt(4)/sqrt(3) which is 2/√3. But usually, we rationalize the denominator. To rationalize 2/√3, multiply numerator and denominator by √3, which gives (2√3)/(√3*√3) = 2√3/3. So sqrt(1 1/3) simplifies to 2√3/3.Now, the original expression is (sqrt(12) + sqrt(1 1/3)) * sqrt(3). Substituting the simplified radicals, that becomes (2√3 + 2√3/3) * √3. Let me compute the sum inside the parentheses first.To add 2√3 and 2√3/3, they need a common denominator. 2√3 is the same as 6√3/3. So 6√3/3 + 2√3/3 = (6√3 + 2√3)/3 = 8√3/3.So now the expression is (8√3/3) * √3. Multiplying these together: 8√3/3 * √3. Let&#39;s handle the multiplication of the radicals first. √3 * √3 is 3. So we have 8/3 * 3. The 3 in the denominator and the 3 from the multiplication will cancel out, leaving 8. So the first problem simplifies to 8. Let me check that again.Wait, let me verify step by step. Starting with sqrt(12) = 2√3, correct. Then 1 1/3 is 4/3, sqrt(4/3) is 2/√3, which becomes 2√3/3 after rationalizing. Then adding 2√3 and 2√3/3. Converting 2√3 to thirds: 2√3 = 6√3/3. So adding 6√3/3 + 2√3/3 = 8√3/3. Then multiplying by sqrt(3): (8√3/3)*(sqrt(3)) = 8*(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3))/3 = 8*3/3 = 8. Yep, that&#39;s correct. So first answer is 8.Moving on to the second problem: sqrt(48) - sqrt(54) divided by sqrt(2) + (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)). Let me parse this carefully. Order of operations: division happens before addition and subtraction. So first compute sqrt(54)/sqrt(2), then subtract that from sqrt(48), then add the result of (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)).First, sqrt(48). Let&#39;s simplify that. 48 is 16*3, so sqrt(16*3) = 4√3.Next, sqrt(54) divided by sqrt(2). Simplify sqrt(54): 54 is 9*6, so sqrt(9*6) = 3√6. Then divide by sqrt(2): 3√6 / sqrt(2). That can be written as 3*√(6/2) = 3*√3. Because sqrt(6)/sqrt(2) is sqrt(6/2) = sqrt(3). So sqrt(54)/sqrt(2) simplifies to 3√3.Then, we have (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)). That&#39;s a difference of squares. (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So here, a=3, b=sqrt(3), so it&#39;s 3² - (sqrt(3))² = 9 - 3 = 6.Putting it all together: sqrt(48) - sqrt(54)/sqrt(2) + (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)) becomes 4√3 - 3√3 + 6. Let&#39;s handle the terms with √3 first. 4√3 - 3√3 is (4 - 3)√3 = √3. Then add 6: √3 + 6. So the expression simplifies to 6 + √3.Wait, let me check each step again.Starting with sqrt(48). 48 is 16*3, sqrt(16)=4, so 4√3. Correct.sqrt(54): 54=9*6, sqrt(9)=3, so 3√6. Then divided by sqrt(2). So 3√6 / sqrt(2). Which is 3*(sqrt(6)/sqrt(2)) = 3*sqrt(6/2) = 3*sqrt(3). Correct.Then (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)): 9 - (sqrt(3))² = 9 - 3 = 6. Correct.So combining the terms: 4√3 - 3√3 + 6. Which is indeed (4 - 3)√3 + 6 = √3 + 6. So the second answer is 6 + √3. Wait, is there a preferred order? Sometimes, they write the constant term first, so 6 + √3. Either way, both are correct, but maybe 6 + √3 is more standard.So final answers: first problem is 8, second is 6 + √3.But let me double-check the second problem once more. Original expression: sqrt(48) - sqrt(54)/sqrt(2) + (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)).sqrt(48) is 4√3. sqrt(54)/sqrt(2) is 3√3. Then (3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3)) is 6. So 4√3 - 3√3 is √3, plus 6 is 6 + √3. Yes, that seems correct.I think that&#39;s all. The key steps were simplifying the radicals, rationalizing where necessary, recognizing the difference of squares, and combining like terms. Both problems involve manipulating radicals and applying algebraic identities. Looks good!Final Answer1. boxed{8}2. boxed{6 + sqrt{3}}&lt;/think&gt;1. To solve ((sqrt{12} + sqrt{1 frac{1}{3}}) times sqrt{3}):   - Simplify (sqrt{12}):     [     sqrt{12} = sqrt{4 times 3} = 2sqrt{3}     ]   - Convert (1 frac{1}{3}) to an improper fraction and simplify (sqrt{frac{4}{3}}):     [     1 frac{1}{3} = frac{4}{3} quad text{and} quad sqrt{frac{4}{3}} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}     ]   - Add the simplified radicals:     [     2sqrt{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}     ]   - Multiply by (sqrt{3}):     [     left(frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}right) times sqrt{3} = frac{8sqrt{3} times sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{8 times 3}{3} = 8     ]   Final answer: (boxed{8})2. To solve (sqrt{48} - sqrt{54} div sqrt{2} + (3 - sqrt{3})(3 + sqrt{3})):   - Simplify (sqrt{48}):     [     sqrt{48} = sqrt{16 times 3} = 4sqrt{3}     ]   - Simplify (sqrt{54} div sqrt{2}):     [     sqrt{54} = sqrt{9 times 6} = 3sqrt{6} quad text{and} quad frac{3sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} = 3sqrt{3}     ]   - Expand ((3 - sqrt{3})(3 + sqrt{3})) using the difference of squares:     [     (3 - sqrt{3})(3 + sqrt{3}) = 3^2 - (sqrt{3})^2 = 9 - 3 = 6     ]   - Combine all terms:     [     4sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3} + 6 = (4sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3}) + 6 = sqrt{3} + 6     ]   Final answer: (boxed{6 + sqrt{3}}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve these two problems. Let me start with the first one: (√12 + √(1 1/3)) × √3. Hmm, alright, let&#39;s break it down step by step. First, I should simplify each of the square roots individually. Let me start with √12. I know that 12 can be broken down into 4×3, and since 4 is a perfect square, √12 becomes √4×√3, which is 2√3. Okay, that simplifies the first term. Next, the second term is √(1 1/3). Wait, 1 1/3 is a mixed number. I need to convert that into an improper fraction to make it easier to work with. 1 1/3 is the same as 4/3. So, √(4/3). Hmm, maybe I can simplify that. The square root of a fraction is the same as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So √4 / √3. That would be 2/√3. But wait, having a square root in the denominator isn&#39;t usually preferred, so maybe I should rationalize it. Multiply numerator and denominator by √3, so (2√3)/(√3×√3) which is 2√3/3. So √(1 1/3) simplifies to 2√3/3. So now, substituting back into the original expression: (2√3 + 2√3/3) × √3. Let me combine the terms inside the parentheses first. To add 2√3 and 2√3/3, I need a common denominator. 2√3 is the same as 6√3/3, right? Because 2 is 6/3. So 6√3/3 + 2√3/3 = (6√3 + 2√3)/3 = 8√3/3. So now the expression is (8√3/3) × √3. Let&#39;s multiply those together. Multiplying 8√3/3 by √3. First, multiply the coefficients: 8/3 remains. Then, √3 × √3 is (√3)^2, which is 3. So altogether, (8/3) × 3 = 8. Because the 3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out. So the first problem simplifies to 8. That seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Starting with √12: 12 = 4×3, so √4×√3 = 2√3. Correct. Then √(1 1/3): converted to 4/3, which is √4/√3 = 2/√3, rationalized to 2√3/3. Then adding 2√3 and 2√3/3: converted 2√3 to 6√3/3, added to get 8√3/3. Then multiplied by √3: (8√3/3)(√3) = 8×3/3 = 8. Yup, that checks out. Now moving on to the second problem: √48 - √54 ÷ √2 + (3 - √3)(3 + √3). Let&#39;s parse this step by step. Order of operations is crucial here. Remembering PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right). First, let&#39;s handle the division part: √54 ÷ √2. That can be written as √(54/2) because √a ÷ √b = √(a/b). So 54 divided by 2 is 27. Therefore, √54 ÷ √2 = √27. √27 can be simplified because 27 is 9×3, so √9×√3 = 3√3. So that part simplifies to 3√3. Next, let&#39;s simplify √48. 48 is 16×3, so √16×√3 = 4√3. So √48 is 4√3. Now the expression becomes: 4√3 - 3√3 + (3 - √3)(3 + √3). Let&#39;s tackle the multiplication of (3 - √3)(3 + √3). That&#39;s a difference of squares, so (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². Here, a is 3 and b is √3. Therefore, it&#39;s 3² - (√3)² = 9 - 3 = 6. So substituting back, the entire expression is now: 4√3 - 3√3 + 6. Let&#39;s combine the like terms. 4√3 - 3√3 is (4 - 3)√3, which is 1√3 or just √3. Then add 6. So the expression simplifies to √3 + 6. Wait, but let me check my steps again to ensure there&#39;s no mistake. Starting with √48: 16×3, so 4√3. Correct. √54 ÷ √2: √(54/2) = √27 = 3√3. Correct. Then (3 - √3)(3 + √3) = 9 - 3 = 6. Correct. Then combining 4√3 - 3√3 = √3. Then √3 + 6. So the answer is 6 + √3. Depending on how they want it written, maybe it&#39;s written as 6 + √3. But let me confirm if I followed the order of operations correctly. The original problem was √48 - √54 ÷ √2 + (3 - √3)(3 + √3). According to PEMDAS, division comes before subtraction and addition. So we first do √54 ÷ √2, which we did, getting 3√3. Then multiplication (the product of (3 - √3)(3 + √3)), which we calculated as 6. Then we perform the operations from left to right: starting with √48 (4√3) minus the result of √54 ÷ √2 (3√3), which gives √3, then adding the 6. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So the final result is √3 + 6. Alternatively, written as 6 + √3, which is the same thing. So summarizing both problems:1. The first problem simplifies to 8.2. The second problem simplifies to 6 + √3.I think that&#39;s it. Let me just check if I made any miscalculations in arithmetic or square roots. For the first problem, each step seems correct. For the second problem, breaking down √48, √54 ÷ √2, and expanding the product all look good. So I think these are the right answers.Final Answer1. boxed{8}2. boxed{6 + sqrt{3}}&lt;/think&gt;1. Simplify each term inside the parentheses first:   - (sqrt{12} = sqrt{4 times 3} = 2sqrt{3})   - (sqrt{1 frac{1}{3}} = sqrt{frac{4}{3}} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3})   Combine the terms inside the parentheses:   - (2sqrt{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{8sqrt{3}}{3})   Multiply by (sqrt{3}):   - (left(frac{8sqrt{3}}{3}right) times sqrt{3} = frac{8 times 3}{3} = 8)   Final answer: (boxed{8})2.
