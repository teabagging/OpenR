data-v-db1da8c8>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle part (1) first. I need to find the Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point M of curves C₁ and C₂. First, let me recall what each curve represents. Curve C₁ is given parametrically with x = cos α and y = sin² α. So, this is a parametric equation where α is the parameter. If I can eliminate the parameter α, I might be able to express y in terms of x or vice versa. Let me see: since x = cos α, then cos α = x. Then, sin² α = 1 - cos² α = 1 - x². So, y = 1 - x². Therefore, curve C₁ is actually the parabola y = 1 - x². That simplifies things.Now, curve C₂ is given in polar coordinates as ρ cos(θ - π/4) = -√2 / 2. I need to convert this to Cartesian coordinates to find the intersection with C₁. Remember that in polar coordinates, ρ cos(θ - φ) = x cos φ + y sin φ. Wait, the general formula for converting ρ cos(θ - φ) = d to Cartesian coordinates is x cos φ + y sin φ = d. So here, φ is π/4, and the right-hand side is -√2 / 2. Therefore, substituting φ = π/4, we get:x cos(π/4) + y sin(π/4) = -√2 / 2.Since cos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2 / 2, substituting these in:x*(√2 / 2) + y*(√2 / 2) = -√2 / 2.Multiply both sides by 2/√2 to simplify:x + y = -1.So, curve C₂ is the line x + y = -1 in Cartesian coordinates.Therefore, to find the intersection point M of C₁ and C₂, we need to solve the system:y = 1 - x²,x + y = -1.Substitute y from the first equation into the second:x + (1 - x²) = -1.Simplify:x + 1 - x² = -1,- x² + x + 1 + 1 = 0,- x² + x + 2 = 0.Multiply both sides by -1:x² - x - 2 = 0.Solve this quadratic equation:x = [1 ± √(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2.So, x = (1 + 3)/2 = 2 or x = (1 - 3)/2 = -1.Now, check these x-values in y = 1 - x².For x = 2: y = 1 - 4 = -3. But then, checking in x + y = -1: 2 + (-3) = -1. That works.For x = -1: y = 1 - 1 = 0. Then, x + y = -1 + 0 = -1. That also works.Wait, so both points (2, -3) and (-1, 0) lie on both curves? But the parametric curve C₁ has x = cos α, so x must be between -1 and 1. Because cos α can&#39;t exceed 1 or be less than -1. But x = 2 is outside that range. So, x = 2 is not a valid solution for C₁, since x is defined as cos α, which can&#39;t be 2. Therefore, the only valid intersection point is x = -1, y = 0.Hence, the intersection point M is (-1, 0). Let me verify that again.Yes, for x = -1, α must satisfy cos α = -1, so α = π. Then, y = sin² π = 0. Correct. So, M is (-1, 0). The other solution x = 2 is invalid because x must be between -1 and 1 for the parametric equations given. Therefore, M is (-1, 0).Okay, that seems solid. Now, moving on to part (2). Let points A and B be moving points on curves C₂ and C₃ respectively. Find the minimum value of |AB|.First, let me recall what curves C₂ and C₃ are.Curve C₂ is the line x + y = -1, as we found earlier. Curve C₃ is given in polar coordinates as ρ = 2 sin θ. Let me convert that to Cartesian coordinates as well. The polar equation ρ = 2 sin θ can be converted by multiplying both sides by ρ: ρ² = 2 ρ sin θ. Then, in Cartesian coordinates, ρ² is x² + y², and ρ sin θ is y. Therefore, x² + y² = 2y. Bringing all terms to one side: x² + y² - 2y = 0. Completing the square for y: x² + (y² - 2y + 1) = 1, which is x² + (y - 1)^2 = 1. So, curve C₃ is a circle with center at (0, 1) and radius 1.So, C₂ is the line x + y = -1, and C₃ is the circle centered at (0, 1) with radius 1.Now, points A and B are on C₂ and C₃ respectively. We need to find the minimum distance between a point on C₂ and a point on C₃. That is, the minimal distance |AB| where A is on line C₂ and B is on circle C₃.To find the minimum distance between a line and a circle, we can think of the minimal distance from the line to the center of the circle, and then subtract the radius if the line is outside the circle, but if the line intersects or is inside the circle, the minimal distance would be zero. But in this case, points A and B are on different curves: A is on the line, B is on the circle. So, the minimal distance between the line and the circle would be the minimal |AB| where A is on the line and B is on the circle.But actually, since both A and B are moving points on their respective curves, the minimal |AB| is the minimal distance between any point on C₂ and any point on C₃. To find the minimum distance between two sets, in this case, a line and a circle, the minimal distance is either the distance from the line to the circle&#39;s center minus the radius, if the line doesn&#39;t intersect the circle. If it does intersect, then the minimal distance is zero. But let&#39;s check if the line C₂ intersects the circle C₃.First, compute the distance from the center of the circle (0,1) to the line C₂: x + y = -1.The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax₀ + by₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²).First, write C₂ in the form ax + by + c = 0. C₂ is x + y = -1, so x + y + 1 = 0. Thus, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1.The center of the circle is (0, 1). Plug into the distance formula:|1*0 + 1*1 + 1| / sqrt(1 + 1) = |0 + 1 + 1| / sqrt(2) = |2| / sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).The radius of the circle C₃ is 1. Since the distance from the center to the line is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, which is greater than the radius 1, the line does not intersect the circle. Therefore, the minimal distance between a point on the line and a point on the circle is sqrt(2) - 1.Wait, but hold on. The distance from the center to the line is sqrt(2). The minimal distance from the line to the circle is the distance from the line to the center minus the radius, right? Because the closest point on the line to the center is sqrt(2) away, and the closest point on the circle would be in the direction towards the line. So, subtracting the radius from the distance gives the minimal distance between the line and the circle.Therefore, minimal |AB| should be sqrt(2) - 1.But let me verify this with another approach to be sure.Alternatively, parametrize a point A on C₂ and a point B on C₃, compute the distance |AB|, and find its minimum.Let me try this.First, parametrize curve C₂ (the line x + y = -1). Let me let x = t, then y = -1 - t. So, A(t) = (t, -1 - t).Curve C₃ is the circle x² + (y - 1)^2 = 1. Let me parametrize this as B(θ) = (cos θ, 1 + sin θ), where θ is the parameter from 0 to 2π.Then, the distance squared between A(t) and B(θ) is:(t - cos θ)^2 + (-1 - t - (1 + sin θ))^2.Simplify the second term: (-1 - t -1 - sin θ) = (-2 - t - sin θ).Therefore, distance squared is:(t - cos θ)^2 + (-2 - t - sin θ)^2.To find the minimum distance, we can try to minimize this expression with respect to t and θ. However, this seems complicated because it&#39;s a function of two variables. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, fix t and find the minimum over θ, then minimize over t. But even that might be tricky. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, since C₃ is a circle, the minimal distance from a point A on C₂ to the circle C₃ is the distance from A to the center of C₃ minus the radius. So, if we can find the minimal distance from A to the center (0,1), then subtract 1 (the radius) to get the minimal distance from A to the circle.Wait, that works if the line connecting A to the center intersects the circle. The minimal distance from A to the circle would be |AO| - r, where O is the center. Therefore, if we find the minimal |AO| - r, where A is on C₂, then that would be the minimal |AB|.But |AO| is the distance from A to O, so for point A(t) = (t, -1 - t), |AO| = sqrt(t² + (-1 - t - 1)^2) = sqrt(t² + (-2 - t)^2).Simplify (-2 - t)^2 = (t + 2)^2. So, |AO| = sqrt(t² + (t + 2)^2) = sqrt(2t² + 4t + 4).Then, the distance from A to the circle is |AO| - 1. So, we need to minimize sqrt(2t² + 4t + 4) - 1.To minimize this, we can minimize sqrt(2t² + 4t + 4). Let&#39;s set f(t) = sqrt(2t² + 4t + 4). To find its minimum, we can find the minimum of the quadratic inside.The quadratic is 2t² + 4t + 4. Its derivative is 4t + 4. Setting to zero: 4t + 4 = 0 =&gt; t = -1.So, the minimal value of the quadratic occurs at t = -1. Compute 2*(-1)^2 + 4*(-1) + 4 = 2 - 4 + 4 = 2. Therefore, the minimal |AO| is sqrt(2). Therefore, the minimal distance from A to the circle is sqrt(2) - 1, which is approximately 1.414 - 1 = 0.414. So, the minimal |AB| is sqrt(2) - 1.Alternatively, we can think of this as the distance from the line C₂ to the center of C₃ is sqrt(2), subtract the radius 1, so sqrt(2) - 1. Which matches the previous result.Therefore, the minimal value of |AB| is sqrt(2) - 1.But let me double-check using another method. Suppose we parametrize point B on the circle as (cos θ, 1 + sin θ), and point A on the line as (t, -1 - t). Then, the distance squared between them is:(t - cos θ)^2 + (-1 - t - 1 - sin θ)^2 = (t - cos θ)^2 + (-2 - t - sin θ)^2.Let me expand this:First term: t² - 2 t cos θ + cos² θ.Second term: (-2 - t - sin θ)^2 = (t + sin θ + 2)^2 = t² + 2 t sin θ + sin² θ + 4 + 4 t + 4 sin θ.Therefore, the total distance squared is:t² - 2 t cos θ + cos² θ + t² + 2 t sin θ + sin² θ + 4 + 4 t + 4 sin θ.Combine like terms:2 t² + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4) t + (cos² θ + sin² θ) + 4 + 4 sin θ.Since cos² θ + sin² θ = 1, this simplifies to:2 t² + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4) t + 1 + 4 + 4 sin θ = 2 t² + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4) t + 5 + 4 sin θ.To minimize this with respect to t for fixed θ, take derivative with respect to t:d/dt [2 t² + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4) t + 5 + 4 sin θ] = 4 t + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4).Set equal to zero:4 t + (-2 cos θ + 2 sin θ + 4) = 0 =&gt; t = (2 cos θ - 2 sin θ - 4)/4 = (cos θ - sin θ - 2)/2.So, for each θ, the optimal t is (cos θ - sin θ - 2)/2. Then, substitute this back into the distance squared expression to get the minimal distance squared for each θ.But this seems quite involved. Maybe instead, think geometrically.The minimal distance between the line C₂ and the circle C₃ is the distance from the line to the center of the circle minus the radius. Since the line is x + y = -1 and the circle has center (0,1) and radius 1, the distance from the line to the center is |0 + 1 + 1| / sqrt(1 + 1) = |2| / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). Then, subtract the radius 1 to get sqrt(2) - 1. Therefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(2) - 1. Yes, this matches our previous conclusion. Therefore, the minimum value of |AB| is sqrt(2) - 1.But let me confirm once more. Since the line does not intersect the circle (as the distance from the center to the line is sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414 &gt; 1), the minimal distance between a point on the line and a point on the circle is indeed the distance from the line to the center minus the radius. Therefore, sqrt(2) - 1 is correct.Therefore, part (2)&#39;s answer is sqrt(2) - 1.Final Answer(1) The coordinates of point M are boxed{(-1, 0)};(2) The minimum value of (|AB|) is boxed{sqrt{2} - 1}.&lt;/think&gt;(1) To find the Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point ( M ) of curves ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ):- Curve ( C_1 ) is given parametrically by ( x = cos alpha ) and ( y = sin^2 alpha ). By eliminating the parameter ( alpha ), we find ( y = 1 - x^2 ).- Curve ( C_2 ) is given in polar coordinates as ( rho cos(theta - frac{pi}{4}) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Converting this to Cartesian coordinates, we get the line ( x + y = -1 ).Solving the system of equations:[begin{cases}y = 1 - x^2 x + y = -1end{cases}]Substituting ( y = 1 - x^2 ) into ( x + y = -1 ):[x + (1 - x^2) = -1 implies x^2 - x - 2 = 0]Solving the quadratic equation ( x^2 - x - 2 = 0 ), we get ( x = 2 ) or ( x = -1 ). Since ( x = cos alpha ) must be between -1 and 1, the valid solution is ( x = -1 ). Substituting ( x = -1 ) into ( y = 1 - x^2 ), we get ( y = 0 ).Thus, the coordinates of point ( M ) are (boxed{(-1, 0)}).(2) To find the minimum value of ( |AB| ) where points ( A ) and ( B ) are on curves ( C_2 ) and ( C_3 ) respectively:- Curve ( C_2 ) is the line ( x + y = -1 ).- Curve ( C_3 ) is the circle ( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1 ) with center ( (0, 1) ) and radius 1.The distance from the center of the circle ( (0, 1) ) to the line ( x + y = -1 ) is calculated as:[frac{|0 + 1 + 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}]Since the distance from the center to the line is ( sqrt{2} ) and the radius of the circle is 1, the minimum distance between a point on the line and a point on the circle is ( sqrt{2} - 1 ).Thus, the minimum value of ( |AB| ) is (boxed{sqrt{2} - 1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to work through these problems step by step. First, problem (1) asks for the Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point M of curves C₁ and C₂. Let me recall what each curve is.Curve C₁ is given parametrically with x = cos α and y = sin² α, where α is the parameter. So that&#39;s a parametric equation in Cartesian coordinates. Curve C₂ is given in polar coordinates as ρ cos(θ - π/4) = -√2 / 2. Hmm, I need to convert C₂ to Cartesian coordinates to find the intersection point with C₁, right?First, for C₂: In polar coordinates, ρ cos(θ - π/4) is a standard form. The general formula for converting polar to Cartesian is that ρ cos(θ - φ) = d represents a straight line at a distance |d| from the origin, making an angle φ with the positive x-axis. But here, the equation is ρ cos(θ - π/4) = -√2 / 2. So this is a straight line in Cartesian coordinates. Let me confirm the conversion.In general, ρ cos(θ - φ) = x cos φ + y sin φ. So substituting φ = π/4, the equation becomes x cos(π/4) + y sin(π/4) = -√2 / 2. Since cos(π/4) and sin(π/4) are both √2/2, this becomes (√2/2)x + (√2/2)y = -√2/2. Multiplying both sides by 2/√2 to simplify:x + y = -1.So curve C₂ is the line x + y = -1 in Cartesian coordinates.Now, curve C₁ is parametric: x = cos α, y = sin² α. To find the intersection with C₂, substitute x and y from C₁ into the equation of C₂.So substitute x = cos α and y = sin² α into x + y = -1:cos α + sin² α = -1.We need to solve for α here. Let&#39;s rewrite sin² α in terms of cos α to make it easier. Since sin² α = 1 - cos² α, substitute that in:cos α + (1 - cos² α) = -1Simplify:cos α + 1 - cos² α = -1Bring all terms to one side:-cos² α + cos α + 1 + 1 = 0Which simplifies to:-cos² α + cos α + 2 = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make it a standard quadratic:cos² α - cos α - 2 = 0Let me set u = cos α. Then the equation becomes:u² - u - 2 = 0Solving this quadratic equation:u = [1 ± √(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2So u = (1 + 3)/2 = 2 or u = (1 - 3)/2 = -1But cos α can&#39;t be 2 because the cosine function ranges between -1 and 1. So the only solution is u = -1. Therefore, cos α = -1.So α = π + 2πk, where k is an integer. Since the parameter can be any real number, the solution is α = π (plus multiples of 2π, but since trigonometric functions are periodic, we can take α = π).Now substitute α = π into the parametric equations for C₁:x = cos π = -1y = sin² π = 0Therefore, the intersection point M has coordinates (-1, 0). Let me verify this point is on C₂ as well. C₂ is x + y = -1. Plugging in x = -1 and y = 0: -1 + 0 = -1, which is correct. So M is indeed (-1, 0). That seems straightforward.Now moving on to problem (2): Let points A and B be moving points on curves C₂ and C₃ respectively. Find the minimum value of |AB|.First, let&#39;s understand curves C₂ and C₃. We already converted C₂ to Cartesian coordinates as x + y = -1. Curve C₃ is given in polar coordinates: ρ = 2 sin θ. Let me convert that to Cartesian coordinates as well.For C₃: ρ = 2 sin θ. Multiply both sides by ρ: ρ² = 2ρ sin θ. Since ρ² = x² + y² and ρ sin θ = y, so substituting:x² + y² = 2yBring all terms to one side:x² + y² - 2y = 0Complete the square for the y-terms:x² + (y² - 2y + 1) - 1 = 0 ⇒ x² + (y - 1)² = 1So C₃ is a circle with center at (0, 1) and radius 1.So, problem (2) reduces to: Given a line C₂: x + y = -1 and a circle C₃: (x)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1, find the minimum distance between a point A on the line and a point B on the circle.But wait, the problem states that A is on C₂ and B is on C₃. So we need to find the minimum distance between any point on the line and any point on the circle.But actually, points A and B are moving along C₂ and C₃, so we need to find the minimal |AB| as A moves along C₂ and B moves along C₃. So the minimal distance between the two curves.Alternatively, the minimal distance between the line C₂ and the circle C₃. However, the minimal distance from a line to a circle can be found by taking the distance from the line to the center of the circle and subtracting the radius, if the line doesn&#39;t intersect the circle.Wait, first let me check if the line C₂: x + y = -1 intersects the circle C₃: x² + (y - 1)² = 1.To check for intersection, substitute y = -1 - x into the circle equation:x² + (-1 - x - 1)^2 = 1 ⇒ x² + (-2 - x)^2 = 1Expand (-2 - x)^2: (x + 2)^2 = x² + 4x + 4So the equation becomes x² + x² + 4x + 4 = 1 ⇒ 2x² + 4x + 3 = 0Compute discriminant: 16 - 24 = -8 &lt; 0. So no real solutions. Therefore, the line C₂ and the circle C₃ do not intersect. Therefore, the minimal distance between them is the distance from the line to the center of the circle minus the radius.Wait, formula for distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax₀ + by₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Here, the line C₂ is x + y = -1, which can be rewritten as x + y + 1 = 0. So a = 1, b = 1, c = 1. The center of the circle C₃ is (0, 1).Compute the distance from (0,1) to the line:|1*0 + 1*1 + 1| / sqrt(1 + 1) = |0 + 1 + 1| / √2 = 2/√2 = √2.The radius of the circle is 1, so the minimal distance between the line and the circle is √2 - 1.But wait, the minimal distance between the line and the circle is indeed the distance from the line to the center minus the radius, since the line doesn&#39;t intersect the circle. Therefore, the minimal |AB| is √2 - 1 ≈ 0.4142.But let me confirm this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize points A and B and minimize |AB|.Let me try this parametrization approach. Let point A be on C₂: x + y = -1. So we can write A as (t, -1 - t) where t is a parameter. Point B is on C₃: x² + (y - 1)^2 = 1. So B can be parametrized using polar coordinates: since it&#39;s a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,1), we can write B as (cos φ, 1 + sin φ), where φ is the parameter.Then, the distance squared between A and B is:(t - cos φ)^2 + (-1 - t - 1 - sin φ)^2 = (t - cos φ)^2 + (-2 - t - sin φ)^2Expanding this:= t² - 2t cos φ + cos² φ + ( -2 - t - sin φ )²= t² - 2t cos φ + cos² φ + (4 + 4t + t² + 4 sin φ + 2t sin φ + sin² φ )Wait, perhaps expanding step by step:First, (-2 - t - sin φ)^2 = (- (2 + t + sin φ))² = (2 + t + sin φ)^2 = (t + sin φ + 2)^2 = t² + 2 t sin φ + sin² φ + 4 t + 4 sin φ + 4.Therefore, the total distance squared is:(t² - 2t cos φ + cos² φ) + (t² + 2t sin φ + sin² φ + 4t + 4 sin φ + 4)Combine terms:= t² - 2t cos φ + cos² φ + t² + 2t sin φ + sin² φ + 4t + 4 sin φ + 4= 2t² + (-2 cos φ + 2 sin φ + 4) t + (cos² φ + sin² φ) + 4 sin φ + 4Simplify using cos² φ + sin² φ = 1:= 2t² + (-2 cos φ + 2 sin φ + 4) t + 1 + 4 sin φ + 4= 2t² + (-2 cos φ + 2 sin φ + 4) t + 5 + 4 sin φNow, to find the minimal distance, we need to minimize this expression over both t and φ. This seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way.Alternatively, since we need the minimal distance between a point on the line and a point on the circle, and the line doesn&#39;t intersect the circle, the minimal distance is the distance from the line to the center of the circle minus the radius. As we computed earlier, that would be √2 - 1. So that should be the minimal |AB|.Wait, but let me verify this. The minimal distance between two sets is the infimum of |AB| where A is in one set and B in the other. For a line and a circle, if they don&#39;t intersect, the minimal distance is the distance from the line to the center of the circle minus the radius. Yes, that&#39;s a standard result in geometry.Alternatively, if we consider the line and the circle, the closest points would lie along the line connecting the center of the circle to the closest point on the line. Let&#39;s visualize this.The line C₂ is x + y = -1. The center of the circle C₃ is (0,1). The closest point on the line to the center (0,1) is the projection of the center onto the line. The distance from the center to the line is √2, as computed earlier. Then, the minimal distance from the line to the circle is √2 - 1, since the radius is 1. Therefore, the minimal |AB| is √2 - 1.Therefore, the minimal value of |AB| is √2 - 1, which is approximately 0.4142.But to be thorough, let me check this with another approach. Let&#39;s parametrize the line C₂: any point on C₂ can be written as (t, -1 - t). The distance from this point to the center of the circle (0,1) is sqrt(t² + (-1 - t - 1)^2) = sqrt(t² + (-2 - t)^2). The minimal distance from a point on the line to the center is the distance we already calculated, which is √2. Therefore, the minimal distance from the line to the circle is √2 - 1. Therefore, the minimal |AB| is √2 - 1. Hence, the answer is √2 - 1.But wait, another way to think about it is, if we take a point A on C₂ and a point B on C₃, then the minimal |AB| is the minimal distance between any point on C₂ and any point on C₃. Since C₃ is a circle, the minimal distance from C₂ to C₃ is the distance from C₂ to the center of C₃ minus the radius. As we have already determined, that is √2 - 1. Therefore, the minimal |AB| is √2 - 1.Therefore, problem (2)&#39;s answer is √2 - 1. Let me confirm once again.Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the problem. Let’s take point A on line x + y = -1. Let me write A as (a, -1 - a). Then point B is on the circle x² + (y - 1)^2 = 1. Let me write B as (b, 1 + sqrt(1 - b²)), but actually, parametrizing the circle as (cos φ, 1 + sin φ) is better. Then, the distance squared between A and B is (a - cos φ)^2 + (-1 - a - 1 - sin φ)^2 = (a - cos φ)^2 + (-2 - a - sin φ)^2. To minimize this over a and φ.But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, since we know the minimal distance is √2 - 1, we can check if that&#39;s achievable. For example, the closest point on C₂ to the center of C₃ (0,1) is the projection of (0,1) onto C₂. Let&#39;s compute that projection.The formula for projecting a point (x₀, y₀) onto the line ax + by + c = 0 is:The projected point (x, y) is given by:x = x₀ - a*(a x₀ + b y₀ + c)/(a² + b²)y = y₀ - b*(a x₀ + b y₀ + c)/(a² + b²)For our line C₂: x + y + 1 = 0, so a=1, b=1, c=1. The center of C₃ is (0,1). Plug into the formula:First compute the numerator: a x₀ + b y₀ + c = 1*0 + 1*1 + 1 = 2Denominator: a² + b² = 1 + 1 = 2Therefore,x = 0 - 1*(2)/2 = -1y = 1 - 1*(2)/2 = 1 - 1 = 0So the projection of (0,1) onto C₂ is the point (-1, 0), which is point M from part (1)! Then, the distance from (0,1) to (-1,0) is sqrt((-1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = √2. Therefore, the minimal distance from the center of the circle to the line is √2. Since the radius of the circle is 1, the minimal distance from the line to the circle is √2 - 1. Thus, the minimal |AB| is √2 - 1. Therefore, the answer is indeed √2 - 1.But wait, point M is (-1, 0), which is on C₂, and the closest point on the circle C₃ to M would be along the line connecting M and the center of the circle. The center of C₃ is (0,1). The line from M (-1,0) to (0,1) has direction vector (1,1). The circle C₃ is centered at (0,1) with radius 1. So the point on C₃ closest to M is moving from the center (0,1) towards M, but only a distance of 1. Let me compute that point.The vector from the center (0,1) to M (-1,0) is (-1, -1). The unit vector in this direction is (-1/√2, -1/√2). Since the radius is 1, the point on the circle in this direction is (0,1) + (-1/√2, -1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2, 1 - 1/√2). Therefore, the closest point B on C₃ to M is (-1/√2, 1 - 1/√2). The distance between M (-1,0) and B (-1/√2, 1 - 1/√2) is sqrt[ (-1 + 1/√2)^2 + (0 - 1 + 1/√2)^2 ].Let me compute this:First component: (-1 + 1/√2)^2 = (1 - 1/√2)^2 = 1 - 2/√2 + 1/2 = 1 - √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 - √2Second component: (-1 + 1/√2)^2 same as above = 1.5 - √2Total distance squared: 2*(1.5 - √2) = 3 - 2√2Therefore, distance is sqrt(3 - 2√2). Let me compute sqrt(3 - 2√2). Let&#39;s see, sqrt( (√2 - 1)^2 ) = √2 - 1, because (√2 -1)^2 = 2 - 2√2 +1 = 3 - 2√2. So sqrt(3 - 2√2) = √2 -1. Therefore, the distance between M and B is √2 -1. Hence, this confirms that the minimal |AB| is √2 -1, achieved when A is M and B is the point on C₃ closest to M.Therefore, the minimal value of |AB| is √2 -1. So the answers are:(1) M is (-1, 0)(2) The minimum |AB| is √2 -1.Final Answer(1) The Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point ( M ) are (boxed{(-1, 0)}).(2) The minimum value of ( |AB| ) is (boxed{sqrt{2} - 1}).&lt;/think&gt;(1) To find the Cartesian coordinates of the intersection point ( M ) of curves ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ):- Curve ( C_1 ) is given parametrically by ( x = cos alpha ) and ( y = sin^2 alpha ).- Curve ( C_2 ) in Cartesian coordinates is the line ( x + y = -1 ).Substitute ( x = cos alpha ) and ( y = sin^2 alpha ) into ( x + y = -1 ):[cos alpha + sin^2 alpha = -1]Using the identity ( sin^2 alpha = 1 - cos^2 alpha ), we get:[cos alpha + 1 - cos^2 alpha = -1 implies cos^2 alpha - cos alpha - 2 = 0]Solving the quadratic equation ( u^2 - u - 2 = 0 ) where ( u = cos alpha ), we find ( u = -1 ).

Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it&#39;s often helpful to rewrite the terms....&lt;,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve the equation 7^(-x) - 3*7^(1+x) = 4. Hmm, exponential equations can sometimes be tricky, but let me see. Let me start by writing down the equation again to make sure I have it right:7^(-x) - 3 * 7^(1 + x) = 4.First, I notice that both terms have 7 raised to some power involving x. Maybe I can rewrite this equation using a substitution to make it simpler. Let&#39;s let y = 7^x. Then, 7^(-x) would be 1/y, right? Because 7^(-x) is the same as 1/(7^x). Similarly, 7^(1 + x) can be written as 7^1 * 7^x, which is 7 * y. Let me substitute these into the equation:1/y - 3*(7*y) = 4.Simplify that:1/y - 21y = 4.Hmm, okay, so now we have an equation in terms of y. Let&#39;s rearrange this equation to make it look like a standard quadratic equation. If I multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator, I get:1 - 21y^2 = 4y.Then, bringing all terms to one side:-21y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0.Wait, the coefficients are negative here. Maybe I should rearrange the terms to make the coefficient of y^2 positive. Let&#39;s multiply both sides by -1 to make it more standard:21y^2 + 4y - 1 = 0.Now, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of y. Let&#39;s check the coefficients: a = 21, b = 4, c = -1. To solve for y, I can use the quadratic formula:y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).Plugging in the values:y = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 4*21*(-1))]/(2*21).Calculate the discriminant first:Discriminant D = 16 - 4*21*(-1) = 16 + 84 = 100.That&#39;s a perfect square, so that&#39;s good. Then:y = [-4 ± sqrt(100)]/42 = [-4 ± 10]/42.So we have two solutions:1. y = (-4 + 10)/42 = 6/42 = 1/7.2. y = (-4 - 10)/42 = -14/42 = -1/3.Wait a second, y was defined as 7^x, right? Since 7^x is always positive for any real x, y cannot be negative. Therefore, y = -1/3 is not a valid solution. So the only possible solution is y = 1/7.So, y = 1/7 = 7^x. Let&#39;s solve for x here. If 7^x = 1/7, that&#39;s the same as 7^x = 7^(-1). Therefore, x = -1.Let me check if this solution is valid by substituting x = -1 back into the original equation:Left side: 7^(-(-1)) - 3*7^(1 + (-1)) = 7^1 - 3*7^0 = 7 - 3*1 = 7 - 3 = 4.Right side: 4.So 4 = 4. That works out. Therefore, x = -1 is indeed the solution.Wait, but let me just make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in the substitution step. Let me go through the steps again.Original equation: 7^(-x) - 3*7^(1+x) = 4.Substitute y = 7^x. Then 7^(-x) = 1/y, and 7^(1+x) = 7*7^x = 7y. So substituting gives:1/y - 3*(7y) = 4.Which simplifies to:1/y - 21y = 4.Multiplying both sides by y: 1 - 21y^2 = 4y.Rearranged: 21y^2 + 4y -1 = 0.Quadratic formula: y = [-4 ± sqrt(16 +84)]/42 = [-4 ±10]/42.So yes, y = 6/42 = 1/7 and y = -14/42 = -1/3. Discard negative solution. Then y =1/7, which is 7^x = 7^(-1), so x = -1.Checked by substitution into original equation: correct. So seems solid.I think that&#39;s it. The key steps were recognizing the substitution for y, solving the quadratic equation, discarding the extraneous solution, and then verifying by substitution. All steps check out, so x = -1 is the solution.Final AnswerThe solution is boxed{-1}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (7^{-x} - 3 cdot 7^{1+x} = 4), we start by making a substitution to simplify the equation. Let (y = 7^x). Then, (7^{-x} = frac{1}{y}) and (7^{1+x} = 7 cdot 7^x = 7y). Substituting these into the equation, we get:[frac{1}{y} - 3 cdot 7y = 4.]Multiplying through by (y) to clear the denominator:[1 - 21y^2 = 4y.]Rearranging terms to form a quadratic equation:[21y^2 + 4y - 1 = 0.]Using the quadratic formula (y = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) with (a = 21), (b = 4), and (c = -1):[y = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 84}}{42} = frac{-4 pm 10}{42}.]This gives two solutions:[y = frac{6}{42} = frac{1}{7} quad text{and} quad y = frac{-14}{42} = -frac{1}{3}.]Since (y = 7^x) must be positive, we discard (y = -frac{1}{3}). Thus, (y = frac{1}{7}). Solving for (x):[7^x = frac{1}{7} implies 7^x = 7^{-1} implies x = -1.]Verifying by substituting (x = -1) back into the original equation confirms the solution is correct. Therefore, the solution is (boxed{-1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🔑:</span>Solution: 7^{-x}-3 cdot 7^{1+x}=4, frac{1}{7^{x}}-21 cdot 7^{x}=4,-21left(7^{x}right)^{2}-4 cdot 7^{x}+1=0,left(7^{x}right)=frac{4 pm sqrt{16+84}}{-42}=frac{4 pm 10}{-42}=left[begin{array}{l}-frac{14}{42}=-frac{1}{3} text {, not valid }  frac{1}{7}end{array}, x=-1right..

The options are A through D, with various intervals. Let me think about how to approach this.First, the equation given is ab = a + b + 3. Since both a and b are positive, maybe I can use some inequality principles here. Maybe the AM-GM inequality? Let me recall that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. For two positive numbers a and b, AM is (a + b)/2 and GM is √(ab). So, (a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab). But how does that relate to the equation given?Alternatively, maybe I can express a + b in terms of ab from the given equation. Let&#39;s see:From ab = a + b + 3, we can rearrange this to a + b = ab - 3. So, now we have a + b in terms of ab. If I can relate a + b and ab using AM-GM, perhaps substitute this expression into the inequality.Using AM-GM on a and b:(a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab)Multiply both sides by 2:a + b ≥ 2√(ab)But from earlier, a + b = ab - 3. So substitute that into the inequality:ab - 3 ≥ 2√(ab)Hmm, this gives us an inequality in terms of ab. Let me set x = ab for simplicity. Then the inequality becomes:x - 3 ≥ 2√xSo, let&#39;s rewrite this:x - 2√x - 3 ≥ 0This looks like a quadratic in terms of √x. Let me let y = √x, so x = y². Then the inequality becomes:y² - 2y - 3 ≥ 0Now, solving this quadratic inequality:First, find the roots of y² - 2y - 3 = 0Using the quadratic formula:y = [2 ± √(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± √16]/2 = [2 ± 4]/2So, y = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and y = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1So the roots are y = 3 and y = -1. Since y = √x and x is ab which is positive (since a and b are positive), y must also be positive. Therefore, we can ignore the negative root y = -1.The quadratic y² - 2y - 3 factors as (y - 3)(y + 1) ≥ 0. The critical points are y = 3 and y = -1. Since we are only considering y ≥ 0 (because y = √x and x ≥ 0), the intervals to test are [0, 3) and (3, ∞). Let&#39;s pick a test value in each interval.For y in [0, 3), say y = 2:(2 - 3)(2 + 1) = (-1)(3) = -3 &lt; 0For y in (3, ∞), say y = 4:(4 - 3)(4 + 1) = (1)(5) = 5 &gt; 0Since the inequality is ≥ 0, the solution is y ≤ -1 or y ≥ 3. But since y ≥ 0, we only take y ≥ 3. Therefore, y ≥ 3.But y = √x, so √x ≥ 3 ⇒ x ≥ 9. Therefore, ab ≥ 9. So the range of ab is [9, +∞). Let me check the options. Option B is [9, +∞), so that&#39;s probably the answer.But wait, let me verify this with some examples. Suppose ab = 9. Then according to the equation ab = a + b + 3, we have a + b = 9 - 3 = 6. So, if a + b = 6 and ab = 9, then the numbers a and b satisfy the equation x² - 6x + 9 = 0, which is (x - 3)² = 0. So a = b = 3. That works, since 3*3 = 9 and 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. So that&#39;s a valid case.What if ab is greater than 9? Let&#39;s pick ab = 10. Then a + b = 10 - 3 = 7. So, solving for a and b such that a + b = 7 and ab = 10. The quadratic equation would be x² - 7x + 10 = 0, which factors as (x - 5)(x - 2) = 0. So a = 5 and b = 2, which are positive. So that works. So ab can indeed be 10, which is greater than 9.What if ab is less than 9? Let&#39;s try ab = 8. Then a + b = 8 - 3 = 5. So the quadratic equation is x² - 5x + 8 = 0. The discriminant is 25 - 32 = -7, which is negative. So there are no real solutions for a and b. Therefore, ab cannot be 8. So the minimum possible value of ab is 9, and it can go to infinity. Therefore, the range is [9, +∞), which is option B.Alternatively, another approach: Let me consider using substitution. Let&#39;s solve the original equation for one variable in terms of the other. For example, from ab = a + b + 3, let&#39;s solve for b:ab - b = a + 3b(a - 1) = a + 3b = (a + 3)/(a - 1)Since a and b are positive, both numerator and denominator must be positive or both negative. But since a is positive, denominator a - 1 must be positive (because numerator a + 3 is always positive). Therefore:a - 1 &gt; 0 ⇒ a &gt; 1So a must be greater than 1. Then b = (a + 3)/(a - 1)We can then express ab as a * [(a + 3)/(a - 1)] = [a(a + 3)] / (a - 1). Let me set this equal to ab and analyze this function for a &gt; 1.So ab = [a(a + 3)] / (a - 1). Let&#39;s let f(a) = [a(a + 3)] / (a - 1). We need to find the range of f(a) for a &gt; 1.To find the range of f(a), maybe take the derivative and find critical points? Since this is calculus, but perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, let&#39;s perform some algebraic manipulation. Let me set t = a - 1, so t &gt; 0 (since a &gt; 1). Then a = t + 1. Substituting into f(a):f(a) = [(t + 1)(t + 1 + 3)] / t = [(t + 1)(t + 4)] / tMultiply out the numerator:(t + 1)(t + 4) = t² + 5t + 4So f(a) = (t² + 5t + 4)/t = t + 5 + 4/tTherefore, f(a) = t + 4/t + 5, where t &gt; 0.Now, we can find the minimum of t + 4/t. Let&#39;s denote g(t) = t + 4/t. The minimum of g(t) occurs at t = √(4) = 2 by AM-GM inequality, since for t &gt; 0, t + 4/t ≥ 2√(t*(4/t)) = 2*2 = 4. The minimum is 4 when t = 2.Therefore, g(t) ≥ 4, so f(a) = g(t) + 5 ≥ 4 + 5 = 9. Therefore, the minimum value of ab is 9, achieved when t = 2, which corresponds to a = t + 1 = 3. Then b = (a + 3)/(a - 1) = (3 + 3)/(3 - 1) = 6/2 = 3. So a = b = 3, as before.Therefore, the range of ab is [9, +∞), which is option B. This confirms the earlier result using substitution and calculus concepts. So the correct answer should be B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given two positive numbers (a) and (b) that satisfy (ab = a + b + 3), we need to find the range of (ab).First, we rearrange the given equation to express (a + b) in terms of (ab):[a + b = ab - 3]Using the AM-GM inequality on (a) and (b):[frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}]Substituting (a + b = ab - 3) into the inequality:[frac{ab - 3}{2} geq sqrt{ab}]Let (x = ab). Then the inequality becomes:[frac{x - 3}{2} geq sqrt{x}]Multiplying both sides by 2:[x - 3 geq 2sqrt{x}]Let (y = sqrt{x}), so (x = y^2). The inequality transforms into:[y^2 - 2y - 3 geq 0]Solving the quadratic equation (y^2 - 2y - 3 = 0) using the quadratic formula:[y = frac{2 pm sqrt{16}}{2} = frac{2 pm 4}{2}]The roots are (y = 3) and (y = -1). Since (y = sqrt{x}) must be positive, we discard (y = -1). The quadratic inequality ((y - 3)(y + 1) geq 0) gives (y geq 3), leading to:[sqrt{x} geq 3 implies x geq 9]To verify, we check if (ab = 9) is achievable. If (ab = 9), then (a + b = 6). The quadratic equation (x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0) has roots (a = b = 3), which are positive. For (ab &gt; 9), examples like (ab = 10) with (a = 5) and (b = 2) confirm validity.Thus, the range of (ab) is ([9, +infty)), corresponding to option B.[boxed{B}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this problem here where I need to find the range of ( ab ) given that ( a ) and ( b ) are positive numbers satisfying ( ab = a + b + 3 ). The options are given as A through D. Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s try to work through this step by step.First, the equation given is ( ab = a + b + 3 ). Both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive. The question is about the range of ( ab ). So, they want to know what possible values ( ab ) can take given that equation. The options are intervals from 6 or 9 upwards or downwards. Let me think about how to approach this.Maybe I can express ( ab ) in terms of one variable and then find its minimum or maximum. Alternatively, I could use some inequality principles here. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, perhaps the AM-GM inequality could be useful. Let me recall that the arithmetic mean of two positive numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. So, ( frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{ab} ). Maybe that can come into play here.But let&#39;s start by manipulating the given equation. We have ( ab = a + b + 3 ). Let me rearrange this equation to group similar terms. If I move ( a ) and ( b ) to the left side, it becomes ( ab - a - b = 3 ). Hmm, I notice that ( ab - a - b ) looks similar to the expansion of ( (a - 1)(b - 1) ), let&#39;s check:( (a - 1)(b - 1) = ab - a - b + 1 ). So, that&#39;s almost ( ab - a - b ), except there&#39;s an extra +1. Therefore, if we take ( ab - a - b = (a - 1)(b - 1) - 1 ). So, substituting back into our equation:( (a - 1)(b - 1) - 1 = 3 )Which simplifies to:( (a - 1)(b - 1) = 4 )Okay, that&#39;s an interesting substitution. So, the product of ( (a - 1) ) and ( (b - 1) ) is 4. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive numbers, ( a - 1 ) and ( b - 1 ) must be greater than -1. But since their product is 4, which is positive, both ( a - 1 ) and ( b - 1 ) must be positive. Therefore, ( a &gt; 1 ) and ( b &gt; 1 ). That makes sense because if either ( a ) or ( b ) were less than or equal to 1, their product would be non-positive (since 4 is positive), which is impossible. So, ( a ) and ( b ) must each be greater than 1.Now, let me let ( x = a - 1 ) and ( y = b - 1 ). Then, ( x ) and ( y ) are positive numbers (since ( a, b &gt; 1 )), and we have ( xy = 4 ). The original equation ( ab = a + b + 3 ) can be rewritten in terms of ( x ) and ( y ). Let me check:Since ( a = x + 1 ) and ( b = y + 1 ), then:( ab = (x + 1)(y + 1) = xy + x + y + 1 )But from the original equation, ( ab = a + b + 3 = (x + 1) + (y + 1) + 3 = x + y + 5 )So, setting these equal:( xy + x + y + 1 = x + y + 5 )Subtracting ( x + y ) from both sides:( xy + 1 = 5 )So, ( xy = 4 ). Which matches our earlier substitution. Therefore, this substitution works.Now, since ( xy = 4 ), and ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, we can use the AM-GM inequality on ( x ) and ( y ). The AM-GM inequality states that ( frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy} ). Substituting ( xy = 4 ):( frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{4} = 2 )Therefore, ( x + y geq 4 ).But we need to relate this back to ( ab ). Since ( ab = x + y + 5 ) (from earlier), and ( x + y geq 4 ), then ( ab geq 4 + 5 = 9 ). Wait, that would imply that ( ab geq 9 ), so the range of ( ab ) is ( [9, +infty) ). Which is option B. But let me verify this carefully to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( ab ) in terms of one variable. Let&#39;s see. Since ( xy = 4 ), we can let ( x = frac{4}{y} ), and then ( ab = x + y + 5 ). So substituting ( x ):( ab = frac{4}{y} + y + 5 )Now, if we consider ( ab ) as a function of ( y ), let&#39;s denote ( f(y) = frac{4}{y} + y + 5 ). To find the minimum value of this function, we can take its derivative and set it to zero.But since this is an algebra problem, maybe calculus isn&#39;t the intended method. Let&#39;s use AM-GM again on ( frac{4}{y} ) and ( y ):( frac{frac{4}{y} + y}{2} geq sqrt{frac{4}{y} times y} = sqrt{4} = 2 )Therefore, ( frac{4}{y} + y geq 4 ), so ( f(y) = frac{4}{y} + y + 5 geq 4 + 5 = 9 ). So, the minimum value of ( ab ) is 9, achieved when ( frac{4}{y} = y ), which implies ( y^2 = 4 ), so ( y = 2 ). Therefore, when ( y = 2 ), ( x = frac{4}{2} = 2 ), so ( a = x + 1 = 3 ), ( b = y + 1 = 3 ). So, ( a = b = 3 ), which gives ( ab = 9 ). That seems correct.Therefore, the minimum value of ( ab ) is 9, and since ( ab ) can be made larger by increasing ( x ) or ( y ) (since they are positive), the range is ( [9, +infty) ). Therefore, the answer should be option B.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another approach. Let&#39;s go back to the original equation ( ab = a + b + 3 ). Let me express this equation in terms of ( a ):( ab - a - b = 3 )( a(b - 1) - b = 3 )( a(b - 1) = b + 3 )( a = frac{b + 3}{b - 1} )Since ( a &gt; 0 ), the numerator and denominator must have the same sign. Since ( b &gt; 1 ) (from earlier reasoning), denominator ( b - 1 &gt; 0 ), so numerator ( b + 3 &gt; 0 ) is always true because ( b &gt; 1 ). So, ( a = frac{b + 3}{b - 1} ).Now, express ( ab ) in terms of ( b ):( ab = b times frac{b + 3}{b - 1} = frac{b(b + 3)}{b - 1} )Let me denote ( ab = frac{b^2 + 3b}{b - 1} ). Let&#39;s simplify this expression. Perhaps perform polynomial division or substitution.Let me set ( t = b - 1 ), so ( b = t + 1 ), where ( t &gt; 0 ). Substitute into the expression:( ab = frac{(t + 1)^2 + 3(t + 1)}{t} = frac{t^2 + 2t + 1 + 3t + 3}{t} = frac{t^2 + 5t + 4}{t} = frac{t^2}{t} + frac{5t}{t} + frac{4}{t} = t + 5 + frac{4}{t} )So, ( ab = t + frac{4}{t} + 5 ). Now, this is the same expression as before. So, using AM-GM on ( t ) and ( frac{4}{t} ):( frac{t + frac{4}{t}}{2} geq sqrt{t times frac{4}{t}} = sqrt{4} = 2 )Therefore, ( t + frac{4}{t} geq 4 ), so ( ab = t + frac{4}{t} + 5 geq 4 + 5 = 9 ). Hence, minimum value is 9, achieved when ( t = frac{4}{t} implies t^2 = 4 implies t = 2 ), so ( b = t + 1 = 3 ), and ( a = frac{3 + 3}{3 - 1} = frac{6}{2} = 3 ). So again, ( a = b = 3 ), ( ab = 9 ).Therefore, regardless of substitution method, we arrive at the conclusion that the minimum value of ( ab ) is 9, and there&#39;s no upper bound since ( t ) can be made arbitrarily large, making ( ab = t + 5 + 4/t ), which tends to infinity as ( t ) increases. Therefore, the range is ( [9, +infty) ), which is option B.Let me check the answer options again:A: [6, +∞)B: [9, +∞)C: (-∞,9]D: (-∞,6]So, B is the correct answer. The other options don&#39;t make sense because we proved that the minimum is 9, so it can&#39;t be less than 9. Therefore, the answer must be B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given two positive numbers (a) and (b) that satisfy (ab = a + b + 3), we need to determine the range of (ab).First, we rearrange the given equation:[ab - a - b = 3]We recognize that this can be rewritten using the substitution (x = a - 1) and (y = b - 1), leading to:[(x + 1)(y + 1) - (x + 1) - (y + 1) = 3]Simplifying this, we get:[xy = 4]Since (x) and (y) are positive numbers (as (a) and (b) are greater than 1), we apply the AM-GM inequality to (x) and (y):[frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy} = 2]This implies:[x + y geq 4]Substituting back into the expression for (ab), we have:[ab = (x + 1)(y + 1) = xy + x + y + 1 = 4 + x + y + 1 = x + y + 5]Since (x + y geq 4), it follows that:[ab geq 4 + 5 = 9]The equality holds when (x = y = 2), which corresponds to (a = 3) and (b = 3). As there is no upper bound for (x) and (y), (ab) can be made arbitrarily large. Therefore, the range of (ab) is ([9, +infty)).Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🔑:</span>Since a and b are positive numbers,we have a+b geqslant 2sqrt{ab}.Given ab=a+b+3,we get ab geqslant 2sqrt{ab}+3.Let sqrt{ab}=t (where tgeqslant 0), then t^2-2t-3geqslant 0.Solving this, we find tgeqslant 3 or tleqslant -1.Therefore, abgeqslant 9.Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}.Since the two numbers are positive and the equation involves ab and a+b, using the basic inequality leads to an inequality about ab.

So, the problem is about a regular 12-sided polygon. We need to find the probability that three randomly selected different segments (either sides or diagonals) can form the sides of a triangle. Hmm, okay. I need to recall how to determine if three lengths can form a triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, for three lengths a, b, c, we need a + b &gt; c, a + c &gt; b, and b + c &gt; a. But maybe if we order them such that a ≤ b ≤ c, then it&#39;s sufficient to check if a + b &gt; c. That might simplify things.First, let me think about the regular 12-gon. In a regular polygon, all sides are equal, and the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For a 12-sided polygon, the number of different diagonal lengths should be... Hmm, let&#39;s see. The side length is the distance between adjacent vertices. Then diagonals can be of different lengths. In general, in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is n-3. Wait, is that right? For n=12, that would be 9 different diagonal lengths? But I need to confirm.Wait, actually, for a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor(n/2) - 1. For example, in a regular pentagon (5 sides), floor(5/2) -1 = 2-1=1, which is correct: there&#39;s only one distinct diagonal length. Wait, but in a hexagon (6 sides), floor(6/2)-1=3-1=2. But in a hexagon, there are two distinct diagonal lengths: the ones that skip one vertex (longer than the side) and the ones that skip two vertices (the diameter). Wait, so maybe for even n, the number is (n/2 -1). For odd n, it&#39;s (n-1)/2 -1? Hmm, maybe the formula is (n-3)/2 when n is odd? Wait, perhaps I need to check.Alternatively, in a regular n-gon, each diagonal can be characterized by the number of sides they skip. For example, in a 12-gon, the sides connect vertices 1 apart. The diagonals can connect vertices 2, 3, 4, ..., up to 5 apart? Wait, because beyond 6, it starts repeating in the other direction. Since 12 is even, the maximum non-overlapping diagonal would be 12/2 -1=5. Wait, 12/2=6, but connecting 6 apart would be a diameter. So, for a 12-gon, the possible distinct lengths are for steps 1 (sides), 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Wait, but step 6 is the diameter. So, actually, there are 6 distinct lengths. Wait, step 1 is the side, steps 2 to 5 are diagonals of different lengths, and step 6 is the diameter. So total distinct lengths: 6. So maybe in general, for even n, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is n/2 -1, but here n=12, so n/2=6, so distinct lengths including the diameter? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.In a regular polygon, the length of a diagonal that skips k vertices is given by 2*R*sin(π*k/n), where R is the circumradius. So, for a 12-gon, the possible k values for diagonals are from 2 to 5 (since k=1 is the side, and k=6 would be the diameter). Wait, but wait, k can go up to floor(n/2). For n=12, k can go from 1 to 6. But k=1 is the side, k=2 to 5 are diagonals of different lengths, and k=6 is the diameter, which is a different length. So, in total, there are 6 distinct segment lengths: sides (k=1), diagonals (k=2,3,4,5), and diameters (k=6). So, 6 distinct lengths. So, in the problem statement, we are to select three different segments from sides and diagonals. So, sides are length L1, diagonals are L2, L3, L4, L5, and diameters are L6. Each with distinct lengths. So, we need to consider all possible combinations of three different segment types and determine how many of them satisfy the triangle inequality.Wait, but the problem says &quot;three different segments are randomly selected.&quot; So, does that mean three different lengths? Or three different segments (i.e., edges or diagonals) regardless of their lengths? Hmm, the wording is &quot;three different segments&quot;. Since a segment here refers to either a side or a diagonal, and they are selecting three different ones. But in a regular 12-gon, there are multiple segments of the same length. For example, each side is the same length, each diagonal of a certain type (e.g., skipping two vertices) is the same length. So, if they are selecting three different segments, meaning three distinct individual segments, but they could have the same length. But the problem says &quot;the probability that their lengths are the side lengths of a triangle&quot;. So, it&#39;s about the lengths, not the specific segments. So, even if you pick three different segments, their lengths might be the same or different. But the problem says &quot;three different segments&quot;, but they can have same or different lengths? Wait, but the problem states &quot;three different segments&quot;, which probably just means three distinct segments, not necessarily of different lengths. But when considering the lengths, we need to see if the three lengths (which could be same or different) can form a triangle. Wait, but in a triangle, the sides need to be positive real numbers, but they don&#39;t necessarily have to be distinct. However, in this problem, the segments are selected as three different segments, but maybe &quot;different&quot; here refers to distinct as objects, not their lengths. So, perhaps two of them could have the same length, but since they are different segments, that&#39;s allowed. But the problem is about the lengths being able to form a triangle. So, even if two lengths are the same, as long as the three lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.But perhaps the problem is about three different lengths? Wait, the problem says &quot;three different segments&quot;. So, segments are different, but lengths can repeat. So, the lengths could be, for example, two sides and one diagonal, which would be two of the same length and one different. But the problem states &quot;their lengths are the side lengths of a triangle&quot;. So, if two of them are the same length, then the triangle would have two sides of that length and one of the other. So, as long as the triangle inequality is satisfied, that&#39;s okay.But maybe the problem is considering three different lengths. Wait, the problem says &quot;three different segments&quot;, which are segments (i.e., sides or diagonals), which are different as segments, but their lengths may or may not be different. So, in the problem statement, &quot;their lengths&quot; refers to the lengths of the three selected segments. So, the lengths can be same or different. However, the problem asks for the probability that those lengths can form a triangle. So, even if all three lengths are the same (equilateral triangle), which would satisfy the triangle inequality. So, in that case, it&#39;s possible.But in a regular 12-gon, can we have three segments of the same length? For example, three sides: each side is the same length, so yes. Then, three sides would form an equilateral triangle. Wait, but in a regular 12-gon, the side length is shorter than the diameter. So, three sides would each have the same length, say s. Then, s + s &gt; s, which is true. So, yes, three sides can form a triangle. Similarly, three diagonals of the same length could form a triangle. So, that&#39;s possible.But perhaps the problem wants three distinct lengths? Hmm, the problem doesn&#39;t specify, so I think it&#39;s any three segments (different as segments) such that their lengths can form a triangle, whether the lengths are same or different.But the answer might require more precise calculation. Let&#39;s see. So, first, we need to find the total number of ways to select three different segments (sides or diagonals) from the 12-gon. Then, find how many of those triplets have lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality. Then, the probability is the ratio of these two numbers.First, total number of segments in a 12-gon. A regular 12-gon has 12 sides and how many diagonals? The formula for the number of diagonals in an n-gon is n(n - 3)/2. So, 12*(12 - 3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54. So, total segments (sides + diagonals) are 12 + 54 = 66. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose three different segments is C(66, 3). Then, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of triplets of segments where the three lengths can form a triangle.But this seems complex because there are many different lengths, and segments of the same length. So, maybe we need to categorize the segments by their lengths first.As we discussed earlier, in a regular 12-gon, the segments can be classified into 6 distinct lengths: sides (k=1), diagonals skipping 2,3,4,5 vertices, and diameters (k=6). Let me confirm the lengths. Let&#39;s denote the side length as s. Then, the length of a diagonal skipping k vertices is 2*R*sin(π*k/12), where R is the circumradius. For k=1 (sides): 2*R*sin(π/12). For k=2: 2*R*sin(2π/12)=2*R*sin(π/6)=2*R*0.5=R. For k=3: 2*R*sin(3π/12)=2*R*sin(π/4)=2*R*(√2/2)=R√2. For k=4: 2*R*sin(4π/12)=2*R*sin(π/3)=2*R*(√3/2)=R√3. For k=5: 2*R*sin(5π/12). For k=6: 2*R*sin(6π/12)=2*R*sin(π/2)=2*R*1=2R. So, the lengths are:- L1 = 2R sin(π/12) ≈ 2R * 0.2588 ≈ 0.5176R- L2 = R- L3 = R√2 ≈ 1.4142R- L4 = R√3 ≈ 1.732R- L5 = 2R sin(5π/12) ≈ 2R * 0.9659 ≈ 1.9319R- L6 = 2RSo, ordering them from shortest to longest: L1 &lt; L2 &lt; L3 &lt; L4 &lt; L5 &lt; L6. So, L1 is the side length, L2 is the diagonal skipping 2 vertices, L3 skips 3, L4 skips 4, L5 skips 5, and L6 is the diameter.Now, we need to know how many segments correspond to each length. For a regular n-gon, the number of diagonals of each type is n for each k from 2 to n/2 -1, and n/2 for the diameter if n is even. Wait, let me verify.In a regular n-gon, for each k (the number of vertices skipped), the number of diagonals of that type is n, because each vertex connects to k-th next vertex, and there are n vertices. However, when k exceeds n/2, the diagonals start overlapping with the ones counted in the other direction. So, for n even, the maximum non-overlapping k is n/2. So, for n=12, k can be from 1 to 6. But k=1 is the side, so diagonals are k=2 to 6. However, k=6 is the diameter, and in n=12, each diameter is counted twice (from each end), but since they are the same diameter, we need to divide by 2. Therefore, the number of diameters is 12/2=6. For k=2,3,4,5, each diagonal is unique and not overlapping, so the number of diagonals for each k is 12. So, total diagonals: for k=2:12, k=3:12, k=4:12, k=5:12, k=6:6. So total diagonals: 12+12+12+12+6=54, which matches the previous calculation. And sides are 12. So, the counts for each length are:- L1 (sides, k=1): 12 segments- L2 (k=2): 12 diagonals- L3 (k=3):12 diagonals- L4 (k=4):12 diagonals- L5 (k=5):12 diagonals- L6 (k=6):6 diametersSo, each length L1 to L5 has 12 segments, except L6 which has 6.So, total segments: 12 +12+12+12+12+6=66, which checks out.So, now, the problem reduces to selecting three different segments from these 66, and wanting the probability that their lengths can form a triangle. So, to compute this, we need to consider all possible combinations of three segments, considering their lengths, and check how many of those combinations satisfy the triangle inequality.However, since segments can have the same length, we have to consider cases where some or all of the selected segments have the same length.This seems complicated, but maybe we can break it down by considering the different combinations of lengths. For example, the three segments could be:1. All three segments of the same length.2. Two segments of one length and one of another.3. All three segments of different lengths.For each case, we can calculate the number of such triplets and then check if they satisfy the triangle inequality.Starting with case 1: All three segments of the same length. For each length Li, the number of ways to choose three segments is C(count(Li), 3). Then, we need to check if three segments of the same length can form a triangle. Well, if all three sides are equal, then they can form an equilateral triangle, which is valid. However, in our case, the segments are sides or diagonals of the 12-gon, but if all three are the same length, say Li, then yes, they can form a triangle. Wait, but actually, in reality, three segments of the same length can form a triangle if the length is positive. Since all lengths here are positive, three equal lengths can form an equilateral triangle. So, all such triplets are valid. So, for case 1, all triplets with three segments of the same length are valid.So, the number of valid triplets in case 1 is sum over each Li of C(count(Li), 3). Let&#39;s compute that.For L1 (count=12): C(12,3)=220For L2 (count=12): 220For L3 (count=12):220For L4 (count=12):220For L5 (count=12):220For L6 (count=6): C(6,3)=20So total for case 1: 5*220 +20=1100 +20=1120.Case 2: Two segments of one length and one of another. For this, we need to consider pairs of lengths (Li, Lj), where i ≠ j, and compute the number of triplets with two from Li and one from Lj. Then, check if the triplet can form a triangle. For this, the lengths would be Li, Li, Lj. To check if they can form a triangle, we need to satisfy the triangle inequality. Since two sides are Li and one is Lj, the triangle inequalities reduce to:Li + Li &gt; Lj, and Li + Lj &gt; Li, and Li + Lj &gt; Li.The last two inequalities simplify to Lj &gt; 0, which is always true. So the main condition is 2Li &gt; Lj. Similarly, if we had two Lj and one Li, the condition would be 2Lj &gt; Li. But in this case, since we have two Li and one Lj, the key condition is 2Li &gt; Lj.But wait, depending on whether Lj is larger or smaller than Li. So, if Lj &lt; Li, then 2Li &gt; Lj is automatically true because 2Li &gt; Li &gt; Lj. If Lj &gt; Li, then we need 2Li &gt; Lj. So, if Lj &gt; Li, we need Lj &lt; 2Li.So, for each pair (Li, Lj), i ≠ j, we need to compute the number of triplets where two are Li and one is Lj, and check if 2Li &gt; Lj (if Lj &gt; Li) or if Lj &lt; Li (in which case it&#39;s automatically true). Wait, actually, even if Lj &lt; Li, we still need to check 2Li &gt; Lj. Wait, but if Lj &lt; Li, then 2Li &gt; Lj is automatically true because 2Li &gt; Li &gt; Lj. So, the only pairs where the condition might not hold is when Lj &gt; Li. So, for ordered pairs where Lj &gt; Li, we need to check if Lj &lt; 2Li. If so, then the triplet is valid. If Lj &gt;= 2Li, then it&#39;s invalid.Therefore, to compute the number of valid triplets in case 2, we can consider all unordered pairs {Li, Lj}, and for each such pair, compute the number of triplets where two are from the longer length and one from the shorter, and vice versa, and check the conditions.But maybe a better way is to consider all ordered pairs (Li, Lj) where Li ≠ Lj, and compute the number of triplets with two Li and one Lj, then check if 2Li &gt; Lj (if Lj &gt; Li) or if Li &gt; Lj (then it&#39;s automatically valid). But perhaps it&#39;s complicated. Let&#39;s structure it.First, for each length Li, we can pair it with every other length Lj (j ≠ i). For each such pair, the number of triplets with two Li and one Lj is C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj). Then, for each such triplet, we need to check if Li, Li, Lj can form a triangle.As per the triangle inequality, since we have two sides of length Li and one of Lj, the conditions are:1. Li + Li &gt; Lj2. Li + Lj &gt; Li → simplifies to Lj &gt; 0, which is always true3. Li + Lj &gt; Li → same as aboveTherefore, only the first condition needs to be checked: 2Li &gt; Lj.So, if Lj &lt; 2Li, then the triplet is valid. Otherwise, it&#39;s invalid.Therefore, for each ordered pair (Li, Lj) with i ≠ j, the number of valid triplets is:If Lj &lt; 2Li: C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj)Else: 0But since Lj can be either greater or less than Li, we need to be careful with the ordering.Alternatively, maybe we can fix Li and Lj such that Lj &lt; 2Li and count accordingly.But perhaps it&#39;s better to handle this in the following way:For each length Li, we need to find all lengths Lj such that Lj &lt; 2Li. For each such Lj (including Li itself, but since we are considering two Li and one Lj, Lj must be different from Li in this case). Wait, no: in case 2, we have two of one length and one of another. So, Lj ≠ Li. So, Lj can be any other length, but Lj must be &lt; 2Li for the triplet to be valid.So, for each Li, we can find all Lj (j ≠ i) where Lj &lt; 2Li. For each such Lj, the number of valid triplets is C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj).Therefore, the total number of valid triplets in case 2 is the sum over all Li, sum over Lj ≠ Li and Lj &lt; 2Li of C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj).Similarly, we might have triplets where there&#39;s two Lj and one Li, but in that case, we need to check 2Lj &gt; Li. But since in case 2, we are considering triplets with two of one length and one of another, we need to handle both possibilities (two Li and one Lj, or two Lj and one Li). But in the above approach, if we consider all ordered pairs (Li, Lj) with i ≠ j, and compute both possibilities (two Li and one Lj, and two Lj and one Li), but we have to avoid double-counting. Wait, no. Since {Li, Lj} is an unordered pair, but in the triplet, the counts depend on which one is the pair and which is the single. Therefore, it&#39;s better to handle them as ordered pairs where we fix which length is the pair and which is the single.So, to avoid confusion, let&#39;s structure this as follows:For each Li:- For each Lj ≠ Li:   - If Lj &lt; 2Li: then two Li and one Lj is valid. The number is C(n_i, 2)*n_j   - If Li &lt; 2Lj: then two Lj and one Li is valid. The number is C(n_j, 2)*n_iBut wait, if Li and Lj are such that Lj &lt; 2Li and Li &lt; 2Lj, then both two Li and one Lj, and two Lj and one Li would be valid. However, in this case, Li and Lj must satisfy both Lj &lt; 2Li and Li &lt; 2Lj. Which implies that Li and Lj are such that Li &lt; 2Lj and Lj &lt; 2Li. Which is equivalent to 0.5Li &lt; Lj &lt; 2Li. So, for Lj in that range, both types of triplets are valid.Alternatively, if Lj &gt;= 2Li, then two Li and one Lj is invalid, but two Lj and one Li could still be valid if Li &lt; 2Lj. Wait, if Lj &gt;= 2Li, then Li &lt; 2Lj is automatically true (since Lj &gt;= 2Li implies 2Lj &gt;= 2*2Li=4Li &gt; Li). Therefore, even if Lj &gt;= 2Li, two Lj and one Li would be valid if Li &lt; 2Lj, which is always true. So, even if Lj is very large, like L6=2R, and Li is small, like L1, then Li=0.5176R, 2Lj=4R, which is greater than Li. So, 2Lj &gt; Li is always true. Therefore, for two Lj and one Li, the condition is always satisfied because 2Lj &gt; Li. Wait, no: if we have two Lj and one Li, the triangle inequalities would be Lj + Lj &gt; Li, Lj + Li &gt; Lj (which simplifies to Li &gt; 0), and Lj + Li &gt; Lj (same as above). So, the main condition is 2Lj &gt; Li, which is true as long as Lj &gt; Li/2. Since Lj is a length in the 12-gon, the smallest Lj is L1 ≈0.5176R, and Li can be up to L6=2R. So, if Lj is L1 and Li is L6=2R, then 2Lj=2*0.5176R≈1.0352R &lt; 2R=Li, so 2Lj=1.0352R &lt; Li=2R. So, 2Lj &lt; Li, which would mean that the triplet with two Lj (L1) and one Li (L6) would not satisfy the triangle inequality. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So, in that case, even for two Lj and one Li, we need to check if 2Lj &gt; Li. So, the condition is not automatically satisfied.Therefore, my previous assumption was incorrect. For two Lj and one Li, the key inequality is 2Lj &gt; Li. So, if Li &gt; 2Lj, then the triplet (Lj, Lj, Li) cannot form a triangle. Therefore, we need to check both conditions: for two Li and one Lj, need 2Li &gt; Lj; for two Lj and one Li, need 2Lj &gt; Li.Therefore, for each ordered pair (Li, Lj), i ≠ j:- If 2Li &gt; Lj: then two Li and one Lj is valid. Number of triplets: C(n_i, 2)*n_j- If 2Lj &gt; Li: then two Lj and one Li is valid. Number of triplets: C(n_j, 2)*n_iSo, total valid triplets for case 2 is sum over all i ≠ j of [C(n_i,2)*n_j if 2Li &gt; Lj] + [C(n_j,2)*n_i if 2Lj &gt; Li]This is quite involved. Let&#39;s try to compute this step by step.First, list the lengths in order: L1 &lt; L2 &lt; L3 &lt; L4 &lt; L5 &lt; L6.Given their approximate values:L1 ≈0.5176RL2 = RL3 ≈1.4142RL4 ≈1.732RL5 ≈1.9319RL6 = 2RSo, let&#39;s make a table of 2Li for each length:2L1 ≈1.0352R2L2 = 2R2L3 ≈2.8284R2L4 ≈3.464R2L5 ≈3.8638R2L6 =4RNow, for each pair (Li, Lj), we can check if 2Li &gt; Lj and 2Lj &gt; Li.But since we have ordered the lengths from L1 to L6, we can note the relations between them.Let&#39;s consider all pairs (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j (since Li &lt; Lj). Then, for each such pair, check:1. For two Li and one Lj: 2Li &gt; Lj?2. For two Lj and one Li: 2Lj &gt; Li? Since Lj &gt; Li, 2Lj is definitely greater than Li (since Lj &gt; Li, so 2Lj &gt; Lj &gt; Li). Wait, if Lj &gt; Li, then 2Lj &gt; Lj &gt; Li, so 2Lj &gt; Li. Therefore, for pairs where Lj &gt; Li, two Lj and one Li will always satisfy 2Lj &gt; Li. Therefore, for any pair where Lj &gt; Li, the triplet with two Lj and one Li is valid. However, the triplet with two Li and one Lj requires 2Li &gt; Lj.Therefore, for each pair (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j:- The number of triplets with two Li and one Lj is C(n_i, 2)*n_j, but only valid if 2Li &gt; Lj.- The number of triplets with two Lj and one Li is C(n_j, 2)*n_i, and since Lj &gt; Li, 2Lj &gt; Li is always true, so these are always valid.Therefore, for each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:- Valid triplets: C(n_j, 2)*n_i + [C(n_i, 2)*n_j if 2Li &gt; Lj]So, let&#39;s go through each pair (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j:1. Pair (L1, L2): i=1, j=2   - Check if 2L1 &gt; L2? 2*0.5176R ≈1.0352R &gt; L2=R? No, 1.0352R &gt; R is false (1.0352R ≈1.0352R which is just slightly over, but wait, L1 is approx 0.5176R, so 2L1≈1.0352R. L2 is R. So 1.0352R &gt; R? 1.0352R &gt; R is true if 1.0352 &gt; 1, which is yes. Wait, 0.5176R * 2 is 1.0352R, which is greater than R (L2). So, 2L1 &gt; L2 is true.Wait, hold on. Wait, L2 is R. 2L1 is approximately 1.0352R. So, 1.0352R &gt; R. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, 2L1 &gt; L2 is true.Wait, but wait, in our earlier approximate values:L1 ≈0.5176R (exact value is 2R sin(π/12)), so 2L1 = 4R sin(π/12). Let&#39;s compute sin(π/12)=sin(15°)= (sqrt(6)-sqrt(2))/4≈0.2588. So, 4R sin(π/12)=4R*(0.2588)=1.0352R. So, yes, 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L2=R≈1R. Therefore, 2L1 &gt; L2 is true.Therefore, for pair (L1, L2):- Valid triplets with two L1 and one L2: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792- Valid triplets with two L2 and one L1: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792Total for this pair: 792 + 792=15842. Pair (L1, L3): i=1, j=3   - 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L3≈1.4142R? 1.0352R &lt; 1.4142R, so no. So, triplets with two L1 and one L3 are invalid.   - Triplets with two L3 and one L1: valid (since 2L3≈2.8284R &gt; L1≈0.5176R)   - Number of triplets: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792Total for this pair: 7923. Pair (L1, L4): i=1, j=4   - 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L4≈1.732R? No.   - Triplets with two L4 and one L1: valid (2L4≈3.464R &gt; L1)   - Number: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792Total:7924. Pair (L1, L5): i=1, j=5   - 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L5≈1.9319R? No.   - Triplets with two L5 and one L1: valid   - Number: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792Total:7925. Pair (L1, L6): i=1, j=6   - 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L6=2R? No.   - Triplets with two L6 and one L1: valid? 2L6=4R &gt; L1≈0.5176R? Yes.   - Number: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180Total:1806. Pair (L2, L3): i=2, j=3   - 2L2=2R &gt; L3≈1.4142R? Yes, 2R &gt;1.4142R.   - Triplets with two L2 and one L3: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792   - Triplets with two L3 and one L2: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792   - Total:792 +792=15847. Pair (L2, L4): i=2, j=4   - 2L2=2R &gt; L4≈1.732R? Yes.   - Triplets with two L2 and one L4:792   - Triplets with two L4 and one L2:792   - Total:15848. Pair (L2, L5): i=2, j=5   - 2L2=2R &gt; L5≈1.9319R? 2R &gt;1.9319R, yes.   - Triplets:792 +792=15849. Pair (L2, L6): i=2, j=6   - 2L2=2R &gt; L6=2R? No, since 2R is not greater than 2R.   - So, triplets with two L2 and one L6: invalid.   - Triplets with two L6 and one L2: valid (2*2R=4R &gt; L2=R)   - Number: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180   - Total:18010. Pair (L3, L4): i=3, j=4    - 2L3≈2.8284R &gt; L4≈1.732R? Yes.    - Triplets with two L3 and one L4: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792    - Triplets with two L4 and one L3:792    - Total:158411. Pair (L3, L5): i=3, j=5    - 2L3≈2.8284R &gt; L5≈1.9319R? Yes.    - Triplets:792 +792=158412. Pair (L3, L6): i=3, j=6    - 2L3≈2.8284R &gt; L6=2R? Yes, 2.8284R &gt; 2R.    - Triplets with two L3 and one L6:792    - Triplets with two L6 and one L3: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180    - Total:792 +180=972Wait, hold on. For pair (L3, L6): two L3 and one L6 is valid if 2L3 &gt; L6. 2L3≈2.8284R &gt; L6=2R, so yes. Therefore, both directions are valid. Wait, but in the previous pairs where Lj &gt; Li, we only considered i &lt; j. So, in pair (L3, L6), i=3, j=6.- 2Li=2L3≈2.8284R &gt; Lj=L6=2R? Yes, so triplets with two L3 and one L6: valid.- 2Lj=2L6=4R &gt; Li=L3≈1.4142R? Yes, so triplets with two L6 and one L3: valid.But the number of triplets:- Two L3 and one L6: C(12,2)*6=66*6=396Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the count for L3 is 12 segments, count for L6 is 6. So:Triplets with two L3 and one L6: C(12,2)*6=66*6=396Triplets with two L6 and one L3: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180Therefore, total for pair (L3, L6): 396 + 180=576Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Since in pair (i,j)=(3,6), Li=L3 has count=12, Lj=L6 has count=6.Therefore, two Li and one Lj: C(12,2)*6=66*6=396Two Lj and one Li: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180So total 396 + 180=576Wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. So, I need to correct that.Similarly, for all pairs, when Lj has a different count (like L6 has count 6), the numbers will vary.So, my previous approach was wrong in assuming that all counts are 12. Actually, for Lj=L6, the count is 6, so when we have two Lj&#39;s, it&#39;s C(6,2)*n_i.Therefore, I need to adjust the calculations accordingly.This complicates things, but let&#39;s proceed carefully.Starting over for case 2:For each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:- If 2Li &gt; Lj: then two Li and one Lj is valid. Number of triplets: C(count(Li),2)*count(Lj)- Since Lj &gt; Li, 2Lj &gt; Li is always true, so two Lj and one Li is valid. Number of triplets: C(count(Lj),2)*count(Li)But note that count(Lj) might be 6 if Lj=L6.Therefore, we need to recompute all pairs with attention to counts.Let&#39;s list all pairs (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j:1. (L1, L2): Li=L1 (count=12), Lj=L2 (count=12)   - 2L1≈1.0352R &gt; L2=R? Yes.   - Two L1 and one L2: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792   - Two L2 and one L1: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792   - Total:15842.

(L4, L6): Li=L4, Lj=L6 (count=6)    - 2L4≈3.464R &gt; L6=2R: Yes.    - Two L4 and one L6: C(12,2)*6=66*6=396    - Two L6 and one L4: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180    - Total:396 +180=57615. (L5, L6): Li=L5, Lj=L6 (count=6)    - 2L5≈3.8638R &gt; L6=2R: Yes.    - Two L5 and one L6: C(12,2)*6=66*6=396    - Two L6 and one L5: C(6,2)*12=15*12=180    - Total:396 +180=576Now, summing all these totals:1. 15842. 7923. 7924. 7925. 1806. 15847. 15848. 15849. 18010. 158411. 158412. 57613. 158414. 57615. 576Now let&#39;s add them step by step:Start with 0.Add 1584: total=1584Add 792: 1584+792=2376Add 792: 2376+792=3168Add 792: 3168+792=3960Add 180: 3960+180=4140Add 1584: 4140+1584=5724Add 1584:5724+1584=7308Add 1584:7308+1584=8892Add 180:8892+180=9072Add 1584:9072+1584=10656Add 1584:10656+1584=12240Add 576:12240+576=12816Add 1584:12816+1584=14400Add 576:14400+576=14976Add 576:14976+576=15552So, total valid triplets in case 2:15,552Now, moving to case 3: all three segments of different lengths. For this, we need to select three distinct lengths Li, Lj, Lk (i &lt; j &lt; k) and count the number of triplets (one segment from each length). Then, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality: for any permutation, the sum of the two smaller lengths &gt; the largest length.Therefore, for three distinct lengths a ≤ b ≤ c, the condition is a + b &gt; c.So, for each combination of three distinct lengths, ordered as a ≤ b ≤ c, we need to check if a + b &gt; c. If yes, then all triplets with these lengths are valid. The number of such triplets is count(a) * count(b) * count(c).Therefore, we need to list all possible triples (Li, Lj, Lk) with i &lt; j &lt; k and check if Li + Lj &gt; Lk. Then, sum the products of their counts.Given the lengths:L1≈0.5176R, L2=R, L3≈1.4142R, L4≈1.732R, L5≈1.9319R, L6=2RLet&#39;s list all possible triples (Li, Lj, Lk) with i &lt; j &lt; k:1.

But wait, in this case, Lk=L4≈1.732, so sum of L2 + L3≈2.4142 &gt; L4≈1.732. Yes, but since we need a + b &gt; c where a ≤ b ≤ c, here a=L2=1R, b=L3≈1.4142R, c=L4≈1.732R. So, a + b ≈2.4142R &gt; c≈1.732R. Yes.12. (L2, L3, L5):1 +1.4142≈2.4142 &gt;1.9319? Yes.13. (L2, L3, L6):2.4142 &gt;2? Yes.14. (L2, L4, L5):1 +1.732≈2.732 &gt;1.9319? Yes.15.

Yes.Now, for each valid combination (where Li + Lj &gt; Lk), compute the number of triplets as count(Li)*count(Lj)*count(Lk). Note that some combinations have counts different for L6.Let&#39;s go through each triple:1. (L1, L2, L3): Valid. Counts:12*12*12=17282. (L1, L2, L4): Invalid. Skip.3. (L1, L2, L5): Invalid. Skip.4.

(L3, L4, L6): Valid.12*12*6=86419. (L3, L5, L6): Valid.12*12*6=86420. (L4, L5, L6): Valid.12*12*6=864Now, summing up all valid combinations:1. 17285. 17288. 17289. 86410.86411.172812.172813.86414.172815.86416.86417.172818.86419.86420.864Let&#39;s compute the total:Start with 0.Add 1728: total=1728Add 1728: total=3456Add 1728: total=5184Add 864: total=6048Add 864: total=6912Add 1728: total=8640Add 1728: total=10368Add 864: total=11232Add 1728: total=12960Add 864: total=13824Add 864: total=14688Add 1728: total=16416Add 864: total=17280Add 864: total=18144Add 864: total=19008So, total valid triplets for case 3:19,008Now, summing up the three cases:- Case 1:1120- Case 2:15,552- Case 3:19,008Total valid triplets:1120 +15,552=16,672 +19,008=35,680Now, total number of possible triplets is C(66,3)=66*65*64/(6)= (66*65*64)/6. Let&#39;s compute this:66 divided by 6 is 11, so 11*65*64=11*4160=45,760Therefore, C(66,3)=45,760Therefore, probability=35,680 /45,760= divide numerator and denominator by 16:35,680 ÷16=2,230;45,760 ÷16=2,860So, 2230/2860. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 10:223/286Check if this can be reduced.

Therefore, fraction is 223/286≈0.7797.Wait, but 35,680 divided by 45,760 is approximately 0.7797, which is 77.97%. But that seems high. Let me check my calculations again, as this seems possibly incorrect.Wait, let me verify the total valid triplets:Case 1:1120Case 2:15,552Case 3:19,008Total:1120 +15,552=16,672 +19,008=35,680Yes. Total triplets: C(66,3)=45,760.35,680 /45,760= 35,680 ÷45,760=0.7797 (approx). But 223/286≈0.7797.But the problem states &quot;three different segments are randomly selected&quot;. So, this would be the probability.But I need to verify if there are any mistakes in the counts.But considering the problem is from a 12-gon, which has various diagonal lengths, and given that many triplets can form triangles, maybe the probability is indeed high. However, let me sanity check.For example, triplets of three sides: which are 12 segments, C(12,3)=220. All such triplets are valid, as 3 sides of equal length can form a triangle. Similarly, triplets with two sides and one short diagonal may be valid, while two sides and one long diagonal (like diameter) may not.But according to our calculation, even triplets with two diameters and one side are invalid, but such cases are rare (only 6 diameters). So, maybe the high probability is correct.However, another approach is to consider the possible lengths and their combinations. Alternatively, the answer might be presented as a reduced fraction. Let&#39;s confirm the fraction:35,680 /45,760= divide numerator and denominator by 160: 35,680 ÷160=223, 45,760 ÷160=286. So, 223/286.But 223 is a prime number? Let&#39;s check. 223: it&#39;s not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. 17^2=289&gt;223, so yes, 223 is prime. 286=2*11*13. Since 223 is prime and does not divide 286, the fraction is irreducible. So, probability is 223/286.But let me check the original calculation again for possible errors.Case 1: triplets with all same lengths. Sum of C(n,3) for each length:For L1 to L5 (count=12 each): C(12,3)=220 each. So 5*220=1100. For L6: C(6,3)=20. Total:1100+20=1120. Correct.Case 2: two of one length and one of another. As per pair calculations, total valid triplets 15,552. Let me check one of the pairs again.For example, pair (L3, L6): valid triplets: C(12,2)*6 + C(6,2)*12=66*6 +15*12=396 +180=576. Correct.Similarly, pair (L1, L2): 1584, which is 792+792. Correct.Case3: three different lengths:19,008.Total:35,680.Total triplets:C(66,3)=45,760.So, 35,680/45,760=223/286≈0.7797.But is this the correct answer? Alternatively, maybe I have miscounted somewhere.Alternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in case3. Let&#39;s recheck some entries.For example, triple (L1, L4, L6): counts are 12*12*6=864. Correct.Triple (L3, L5, L6):12*12*6=864. Correct.Total for case3:19,008. Let&#39;s verify another way. The number of valid combinations in case3 is 19,008. Since there are 20 triples of lengths, and many of them contribute 1728 or 864.But 1728=12*12*12, which comes from three lengths each with count=12. 864=12*12*6, which comes from two counts=12 and one=6 (L6). Let&#39;s count how many 1728s and 864s there are.From the list of valid case3 triplets:1. (L1, L2, L3):17285. (L1, L3, L4):17288. (L1, L4, L5):17289. (L1, L4, L6):86410. (L1, L5, L6):86411. (L2, L3, L4):172812. (L2, L3, L5):172813. (L2, L3, L6):86414. (L2, L4, L5):172815. (L2, L4, L6):86416. (L2, L5, L6):86417. (L3, L4, L5):172818. (L3, L4, L6):86419. (L3, L5, L6):86420. (L4, L5, L6):864Number of 1728s: entries 1,5,8,11,12,14,17 →7 instances.7*1728=12,096Number of 864s: entries9,10,13,15,16,18,19,20 →8 instances.8*864=6,912Total:12,096 +6,912=19,008. Correct.Therefore, case3 is correctly calculated.Similarly, case2 was 15,552. Let&#39;s verify by checking some entries:Pair (L1,L2):1584Pair (L3,L6):576Total over all pairs:15,552. That seems correct.Case1:1120.Total valid triplets:35,680.Probability:223/286. Simplifying decimal is approximately 0.7797, so 77.97%.But the problem might expect the answer in fraction form, which is 223/286. But let me check if that reduces further. As previously determined, GCD(223,286)=1. So, yes.But let me cross-verify with another approach.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all triplets with three same lengths are valid. But for example, three diameters (L6=2R). The lengths would be 2R,2R,2R, which can form an equilateral triangle. Correct. So, yes, they are valid.Another check: consider triplet with two L1 (≈0.5176R) and one L2 (R). According to triangle inequality, 2L1≈1.035R &gt; L2=R≈1R. Since 1.035R &gt;1R, yes, valid. So, triplet is valid.Similarly, triplet with two L2 and one L3: 2L2=2R &gt; L3≈1.414R, valid.Triplet with three different lengths: for example, L1, L2, L3: valid since 0.5176 +1 &gt;1.4142≈1.5176 &gt;1.4142.Another example: L2, L3, L4:1 +1.4142≈2.4142 &gt;1.732: valid.L1, L4, L5:0.5176 +1.732≈2.2496 &gt;1.9319: valid.But for example, triplet with L2, L5, L6:1 +1.9319≈2.9319 &gt;2: valid.So, all these seem correct.Therefore, the probability is 223/286. However, to check if this is the answer expected, perhaps there is a calculation mistake.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute 223/286:Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(223,286). As GCD is 1, so 223/286.But let me see if the question might have a different answer. Maybe I missed some invalid combinations.Wait, but according to the problem statement, the answer is to be given in boxed notation. Given that the calculation leads to 223/286, which cannot be simplified further, that might be the answer. Alternatively, maybe the original question expects a different approach.Wait, but perhaps the problem counts segments as distinct, but in terms of lengths, when selecting three segments, even if they are of the same length, but here when we calculated case1, we considered triplets with three segments of the same length, which are valid.But maybe the problem states &quot;three different segments&quot;, which could mean three different lengths. But the problem says &quot;three different segments&quot;, which are different as segments, not necessarily different lengths. The problem says &quot;their lengths are the side lengths of a triangle&quot;, which doesn&#39;t require the lengths to be different. So, including cases with repeated lengths.But according to the problem statement, yes, three different segments (objects), but lengths can repeat. So, the calculation as done is correct.Therefore, the probability is 223/286. But let me cross-verify this fraction.223/286= approximately 0.7797.But let me check with approximate counts:Total valid triplets≈35,680, total triplets≈45,760. The ratio≈0.7797.Alternatively, the problem might have the answer 223/286 or simplified as 223/286. However, 223 is a prime number, so it cannot be reduced.Therefore, the probability is 223/286.But wait, let me check once more the calculation for case3 triple (L1, L4, L5):Li + Lj=0.5176R +1.732R=2.2496R &gt; L5=1.9319R: yes.Similarly, triple (L1, L4, L6):0.5176 +1.732=2.2496 &gt;2R: yes.Triple (L1, L5, L6):0.5176 +1.9319=2.4495 &gt;2R: yes.All correct.Yes, so the calculation seems right. Therefore, the answer is 223/286.But before finalizing, let me check once more the case2 total:15,552. When adding up all the pair totals:Pair totals:1584,792,792,792,180,1584,1584,1584,180,1584,1584,576,1584,576,576.Adding these step by step:Start with 0.+1584=1584+792=2376+792=3168+792=3960+180=4140+1584=5724+1584=7308+1584=8892+180=9072+1584=10656+1584=12240+576=12816+1584=14400+576=14976+576=15552. Correct.So, yes, case2=15,552.Therefore, the final probability is 223/286.But in case the problem expects a reduced fraction or a different form, but since 223 and 286 have no common factors, this is the simplest form.Thus, the answer is boxed{dfrac{223}{286}}.Final AnswerThe probability is boxed{dfrac{223}{286}}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the probability that three randomly selected different segments (sides or diagonals) from a regular 12-sided polygon can form the side lengths of a triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. The key steps are as follows:1. Identify Segment Lengths:   - A regular 12-sided polygon has 6 distinct segment lengths: side (L1), diagonals (L2, L3, L4, L5), and diameter (L6).   - Counts of each segment: L1-L5 have 12 each, L6 has 6.2. Total Number of Segments:   - Total segments (sides + diagonals) = 66.   - Total ways to choose 3 segments: ( binom{66}{3} = 45760 ).3. Valid Triplets:   - Case 1: All three segments of the same length:     - Sum of combinations for each length: ( 5 times binom{12}{3} + binom{6}{3} = 1120 ).   - Case 2: Two segments of one length and one of another:     - For each pair of lengths, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality and sum valid combinations.     - Total valid triplets: 15552.   - Case 3: Three segments of different lengths:     - Check all combinations of three different lengths and sum valid combinations.     - Total valid triplets: 19008.4. Total Valid Triplets:   - Sum of valid triplets from all cases: ( 1120 + 15552 + 19008 = 35680 ).5. Probability Calculation:   - Probability = ( frac{35680}{45760} = frac{223}{286} ).The probability that the lengths of three randomly selected different segments can form a triangle is (boxed{dfrac{223}{286}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this probability problem. So, we have a regular 12-sided polygon, and we&#39;re supposed to find the probability that three randomly selected different segments (either sides or diagonals) can form a triangle. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to select three distinct segments from all the sides and diagonals of a regular 12-gon. Then, we want to know the probability that these three lengths can form a triangle. That means the three lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, the key is to figure out how many such triplets satisfy all three triangle inequalities, and then divide that by the total number of possible triplets.Alright, so step one is to figure out the total number of different segments in a regular 12-sided polygon. A regular 12-gon has 12 sides, and the number of diagonals in any n-gon is given by n(n - 3)/2. So for n=12, that&#39;s 12*(12 - 3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. Therefore, the total number of segments (sides + diagonals) is 12 + 54 = 66. So, the total number of ways to choose three different segments is C(66, 3). Let me compute that. The combination formula C(n, k) is n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, C(66, 3) is (66*65*64)/(3*2*1). Let&#39;s compute that:66*65 = 4290; 4290*64 = 274,560; divided by 6: 274,560 / 6 = 45,760. So, total possible triplets are 45,760. Wait, hold on: 66*65*64 = 66*4160 = 274,560? Wait, 66*65 is 4290, then 4290*64. Let&#39;s check that again: 4290*60 = 257,400 and 4290*4 = 17,160. Adding those gives 257,400 + 17,160 = 274,560. Yes. Then 274,560 divided by 6 is indeed 45,760. So total number is 45,760.Now, the next step is to figure out how many of these triplets can form a triangle. That is, for three lengths a, b, c (sorted such that a ≤ b ≤ c), they can form a triangle if a + b &gt; c. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of triplets where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.But in a regular 12-gon, the lengths of the sides and diagonals are not all distinct. The lengths depend on the number of sides they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, the length of a side is determined by the number of edges between the two vertices. So, in a 12-gon, the possible segment lengths are determined by the step k, where k = 1, 2, ..., 5 (since beyond k=6, the diagonals start repeating because the polygon is regular and symmetric). Wait, in a 12-gon, the maximum non-repeating step is 5. Because stepping 6 would be the diameter, and stepping more than 6 would be equivalent to stepping less on the other side. For example, step 7 in a 12-gon is equivalent to step 5 (since 12 - 7 = 5). Similarly, step 8 is equivalent to step 4, etc. So, the distinct lengths correspond to k=1 to k=6. Wait, k=6 is the diameter, which is a straight line through the center. So, in a 12-gon, the distinct chord lengths correspond to k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, there are 6 distinct lengths. Wait, but for k=1, that&#39;s the side length. For k=2 to 6, those are different diagonals. But wait, k=6 is the diameter. So, in total, 6 distinct lengths. Let me confirm this.Yes, in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct chord lengths is floor(n/2). For even n=12, floor(12/2)=6. So, 6 distinct lengths. So, each chord length corresponds to a step k=1 (side) up to k=6 (diameter). Each step k from 1 to 6 gives a distinct length. So, there are 6 different lengths. Let&#39;s note down their counts.For a regular 12-gon, each chord of step k (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 6) has how many instances? For k=1 (sides): each vertex connects to the next one, so there are 12 sides. Similarly, for k=2: each vertex connects to the one two steps away, so there are 12 such diagonals. Similarly, for k=3: 12 diagonals, k=4: 12, k=5:12, and k=6: 6 diameters (since each diameter connects two vertices opposite each other, and there are 12 vertices, so 6 diameters). Wait, hold on. For k=6 in a 12-gon, each diameter is counted twice if we consider stepping 6 from each vertex, but since stepping 6 from any vertex leads to the opposite vertex, and there are 12 vertices, but each diameter connects two vertices, so there are 12/2=6 unique diameters. Therefore, the counts for each step k are:- k=1 (sides): 12- k=2: 12- k=3:12- k=4:12- k=5:12- k=6:6So, total segments: 12*5 +6 = 66, which matches our initial calculation. So, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the lengths correspond to k=1 to k=6, with counts 12,12,12,12,12,6. Each of these lengths is distinct. Let&#39;s denote them as L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, where L1 is the side length (k=1), L2 is the diagonal with step 2, etc., up to L6 which is the diameter.So, the lengths increase from L1 to L6. So, L1 &lt; L2 &lt; L3 &lt; L4 &lt; L5 &lt; L6. Because as the step k increases, the length of the chord increases in a regular polygon. For example, in a regular polygon, the chord length is given by 2*R*sin(π*k/n), where R is the radius. So, for n=12, chord length for step k is 2*R*sin(π*k/12). Since sine increases from 0 to π/2 and decreases from π/2 to π, but since k goes up to 6 (which is π/2 for n=12), the lengths increase from k=1 to k=6. So, L1 &lt; L2 &lt; ... &lt; L6.Therefore, when considering triplets of lengths, we can sort them and check the triangle inequality. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordered triplets (a, b, c) where a ≤ b ≤ c (with a, b, c being lengths from L1 to L6) such that a + b &gt; c. Then, considering the multiplicities (i.e., how many segments correspond to each length), we can compute the total number of valid triplets.Therefore, we need to compute, for each possible combination of lengths (Li, Lj, Lk) where Li ≤ Lj ≤ Lk, whether Li + Lj &gt; Lk. If yes, then the number of such triplets is the product of the counts of each length. However, we need to be careful if some lengths are the same. Wait, but in our case, all lengths are distinct (L1 to L6 are all different). So, each triplet of lengths is either choosing three different lengths or some duplicates. Wait, but the problem states &quot;three different segments&quot;. Wait, the problem says &quot;three different segments are randomly selected&quot;. So, segments are different, but their lengths could be the same. For example, there are 12 segments of length L1 (the sides), so you could choose three different sides, which would be three different segments, all of length L1. So, even though the segments are different, their lengths could be the same.Therefore, when we select three different segments, they can have lengths that are same or different. So, the triplet of lengths can have all three same, two same and one different, or all different. But the triangle inequality must hold. However, for three lengths to form a triangle, even if they are not all distinct, the triangle inequality must hold. For example, if all three lengths are equal, it&#39;s an equilateral triangle, which is valid. If two are equal, then the sum of the two equal sides must be greater than the third side. So, even with repeated lengths, we still need to check the triangle inequality.Therefore, our approach should be:1. Enumerate all possible combinations of lengths (could be same or different) such that the triangle inequality holds.2. For each valid combination, compute the number of ways to choose three different segments with those lengths.3. Sum all these numbers to get the total number of valid triplets.4. Divide by the total number of triplets (45,760) to get the probability.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to first compute the total number of triplets and subtract those that do not satisfy the triangle inequality. But considering that triangle inequality can fail in multiple ways, maybe it&#39;s better to compute the valid ones directly.But first, let&#39;s note that the lengths are L1 &lt; L2 &lt; L3 &lt; L4 &lt; L5 &lt; L6, each with counts 12,12,12,12,12,6 respectively. So, the counts are:- L1: 12- L2: 12- L3: 12- L4: 12- L5: 12- L6: 6So, for each length Li, the number of segments with that length is 12 for Li where i=1 to 5, and 6 for L6.First, let&#39;s categorize the triplets based on the number of distinct lengths they have:1. All three segments have the same length: For each Li, the number of ways is C(count(Li), 3). However, we have to check if such a triplet can form a triangle. Since all three lengths are equal (Li, Li, Li), the triangle inequality requires that Li + Li &gt; Li, which simplifies to Li &gt; 0, which is always true. So, any triplet with three equal lengths can form a triangle. Therefore, the number of such triplets is sum over i=1 to 6 of C(count(Li), 3).2. Two segments have the same length, and the third is different: For each pair of lengths Li and Lj (i ≠ j), the number of ways is C(count(Li), 2) * count(Lj). However, we need to check if such a triplet can form a triangle. Let&#39;s denote the lengths as Li, Li, Lj. Assume without loss of generality that Li ≤ Lj. Then, the triangle inequality requires that Li + Li &gt; Lj. So, if 2Li &gt; Lj, then it&#39;s valid. If Lj ≥ 2Li, then it&#39;s invalid. So, for each pair (Li, Lj) where Li &lt; Lj, compute if 2Li &gt; Lj. If yes, then the triplet is valid. Similarly, if Li &gt; Lj, then 2Lj &gt; Li? Wait, but since we have two of Li and one of Lj, we need to consider which is larger. Let me rephrase.If we have two segments of length Li and one of length Lj, then sorted, the lengths are min(Li, Lj), min(Li, Lj), max(Li, Lj). So, the triangle inequality would require that min(Li, Lj) + min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). So, that is, 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). Therefore, regardless of which is larger, we can write 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). Therefore, for each pair Li, Lj (i ≠ j), we need to check if 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). If so, then triplets with two of one and one of the other are valid. Otherwise, they are not. Therefore, for pairs where 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj), the number of triplets is C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj), 2)*count(Li). Wait, no. Wait, if we fix the two lengths as Li and Lj, then triplets with two Li and one Lj, or two Lj and one Li. So, total is C(count(Li),2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj),2)*count(Li). However, for each unordered pair {Li, Lj}, we need to check both possibilities. But perhaps it&#39;s better to consider ordered pairs where we first choose the length that is repeated.But perhaps we can first compute for each pair (Li, Lj), i ≠ j, whether 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). If yes, then the number of triplets is C(count(Li),2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj),2)*count(Li). If not, then those triplets are invalid. So, that&#39;s the approach.3. All three segments have different lengths: For each triplet of lengths Li, Lj, Lk where Li &lt; Lj &lt; Lk, the number of ways is count(Li) * count(Lj) * count(Lk). Then, we need to check if Li + Lj &gt; Lk. If so, then it&#39;s a valid triplet. Otherwise, it&#39;s invalid.Therefore, the total number of valid triplets is:- Sum over i=1 to 6 [C(count(Li), 3)] (all same length)- Plus sum over all pairs (Li, Lj), i ≠ j, [valid(Li, Lj) * (C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj), 2)*count(Li))] where valid(Li, Lj) is 1 if 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj), else 0- Plus sum over all triplets (Li, Lj, Lk), i &lt; j &lt; k, [valid(Li, Lj, Lk) * count(Li)*count(Lj)*count(Lk)] where valid(Li, Lj, Lk) is 1 if Li + Lj &gt; Lk, else 0.So, this seems comprehensive. Let&#39;s compute each part step by step.First, compute the number of triplets with all three segments of the same length. For each Li:- For Li = L1 to L5, count(Li) = 12, so C(12, 3) = 220 each.- For L6, count(L6) = 6, so C(6, 3) = 20.So, total for all same length:5 * 220 + 1 * 20 = 1100 + 20 = 1120.Next, compute the number of triplets with two segments of one length and one of another. For this, we need to consider all pairs (Li, Lj) where i ≠ j. There are C(6, 2) = 15 such pairs. For each pair, we check if 2*min(Li, Lj) &gt; max(Li, Lj). If yes, then compute C(count(Li),2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj),2)*count(Li). If no, then 0.First, let&#39;s list all pairs (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j. Since Li &lt; Lj, min(Li, Lj) = Li, max(Li, Lj) = Lj. So, the condition is 2Li &gt; Lj. So, for each pair (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j, check if 2Li &gt; Lj. Let&#39;s note the lengths:We have L1 &lt; L2 &lt; L3 &lt; L4 &lt; L5 &lt; L6. The actual numerical lengths can be calculated using the formula for chord length in a regular polygon: Lk = 2*R*sin(π*k/n). But maybe we don&#39;t need the exact lengths. Instead, since we know the order, maybe we can determine for each pair whether 2Li &gt; Lj holds.But maybe it&#39;s better to compute the ratios. For a regular 12-gon, let&#39;s compute the actual lengths (relative to the side length L1). Let&#39;s compute Lk = 2*sin(π*k/12). Let&#39;s compute these:- L1 = 2*sin(π/12) ≈ 2*0.2588 ≈ 0.5176- L2 = 2*sin(2π/12) = 2*sin(π/6) = 2*0.5 = 1- L3 = 2*sin(3π/12) = 2*sin(π/4) ≈ 2*0.7071 ≈ 1.4142- L4 = 2*sin(4π/12) = 2*sin(π/3) ≈ 2*0.8660 ≈ 1.7320- L5 = 2*sin(5π/12) ≈ 2*0.9659 ≈ 1.9319- L6 = 2*sin(6π/12) = 2*sin(π/2) = 2*1 = 2So, the lengths are approximately:L1 ≈ 0.5176, L2 = 1, L3 ≈ 1.4142, L4 ≈ 1.7320, L5 ≈ 1.9319, L6 = 2.So, now for each pair (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j, check if 2Li &gt; Lj.Let&#39;s list all pairs:1. (L1, L2): 2*0.5176 ≈ 1.035 &gt; 1 (L2). So, 1.035 &gt; 1, yes. So, valid.2. (L1, L3): 2*0.5176 ≈ 1.035 vs L3 ≈1.4142. 1.035 &lt; 1.4142. Not valid.3. (L1, L4): 2*L1 ≈1.035 vs L4≈1.732. Not valid.4. (L1, L5): 2*L1≈1.035 vs L5≈1.9319. Not valid.5. (L1, L6): 2*L1≈1.035 vs 2. Not valid.6. (L2, L3): 2*L2 = 2 vs L3≈1.4142. Wait, 2*L2 = 2*1 = 2. So, 2 &gt; 1.4142. Yes, valid.7. (L2, L4): 2*L2 = 2 vs L4≈1.732. 2 &gt; 1.732, valid.8. (L2, L5): 2*L2=2 vs L5≈1.9319. 2 &gt; 1.9319, valid.9. (L2, L6): 2*L2=2 vs L6=2. 2 is not greater than 2. So, not valid.10. (L3, L4): 2*L3≈2.8284 vs L4≈1.732. 2.8284 &gt; 1.732, valid.11. (L3, L5): 2*L3≈2.8284 vs L5≈1.9319. Valid.12. (L3, L6): 2*L3≈2.8284 vs 2. Valid.13. (L4, L5): 2*L4≈3.464 vs L5≈1.9319. Valid.14. (L4, L6): 2*L4≈3.464 vs 2. Valid.15. (L5, L6): 2*L5≈3.8638 vs 2. Valid.Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s verify:For pair (L2, L3): 2*L2 = 2*1=2. Is 2 &gt; L3=1.4142? Yes. So, valid.Similarly, (L2, L4): 2*L2=2 vs L4≈1.732. 2 &gt;1.732, valid.(L2, L5): 2*L2=2 vs L5≈1.9319. 2 &gt;1.9319, valid.(L2, L6): 2*L2=2 vs L6=2. 2 is not greater than 2. So, not valid.(L3, L4): 2*L3≈2.828 vs L4≈1.732. 2.828 &gt;1.732, valid.(L3, L5): 2*1.414≈2.828 vs L5≈1.9319. 2.828&gt;1.9319, valid.(L3, L6): 2*L3≈2.828 vs L6=2. 2.828&gt;2, valid.(L4, L5): 2*L4≈3.464 vs L5≈1.9319. Valid.(L4, L6): 2*L4≈3.464 vs 2. Valid.(L5, L6): 2*L5≈3.8638 vs 2. Valid.So, out of the 15 pairs (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j, how many satisfy 2Li &gt; Lj?Let&#39;s check:1. (L1, L2): valid2. (L1, L3): invalid3. (L1, L4): invalid4. (L1, L5): invalid5. (L1, L6): invalid6. (L2, L3): valid7. (L2, L4): valid8. (L2, L5): valid9. (L2, L6): invalid10. (L3, L4): valid11. (L3, L5): valid12. (L3, L6): valid13. (L4, L5): valid14. (L4, L6): valid15. (L5, L6): validSo, total valid pairs are: 1,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15. That is 10 valid pairs. The invalid ones are pairs 2,3,4,5,9. So 5 invalid pairs. Therefore, 10 pairs where 2Li &gt; Lj.Now, for each valid pair (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j, we need to compute the number of triplets which have two of Li and one of Lj, plus two of Lj and one of Li. Wait, but since i &lt; j, and the condition is 2Li &gt; Lj, but when we consider two of Lj and one of Li, the condition would be 2*min(Lj, Li) &gt; max(Lj, Li). Since i &lt; j, Li &lt; Lj. So, min(Lj, Li) = Li, max(Lj, Li) = Lj. So, the condition is 2Li &gt; Lj, which is the same as before. However, if we have two of Lj and one of Li, the triangle inequality would be 2*Lj &gt; Li. But Li &lt; Lj, so 2*Lj &gt; Li is automatically true because Lj &gt; Li and 2*Lj &gt; Lj &gt; Li. Wait, hold on.Wait, if we have two Lj and one Li (where Lj &gt; Li), then sorted lengths are Li, Lj, Lj. The triangle inequality requires that Li + Lj &gt; Lj, which simplifies to Li &gt; 0, which is always true. But also, Lj + Lj &gt; Li, which is 2Lj &gt; Li. Since Lj &gt; Li, and Li is positive, 2Lj is definitely greater than Li. So, if we have two Lj and one Li, then the triangle inequality is automatically satisfied. However, this contradicts our earlier reasoning. Wait, no. Let&#39;s check.Wait, the triangle inequality requires that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, for lengths Li, Lj, Lj:1. Li + Lj &gt; Lj =&gt; Li &gt; 0, which is true.2. Lj + Lj &gt; Li =&gt; 2Lj &gt; Li, which is true because Lj &gt; Li (since i &lt; j), so 2Lj &gt; 2Li &gt; Li (if Lj &gt;= Li). Wait, but Lj is greater than Li, but how much? For example, if Lj = 2Li, then 2Lj = 4Li &gt; Li. If Lj is just slightly larger than Li, say Lj = Li + ε, then 2Lj = 2Li + 2ε, which is greater than Li. So, regardless of how much larger Lj is than Li, 2Lj will always be greater than Li because Lj &gt; Li. Therefore, if we have two Lj and one Li (with Lj &gt; Li), then the triangle inequality is automatically satisfied. Therefore, in such cases, even if 2Li &lt;= Lj, the triplet with two Lj and one Li is still valid. Wait, but that&#39;s conflicting with our earlier assumption.Wait, let&#39;s take a concrete example. Suppose Li = L1 ≈0.5176, Lj = L2 =1. Then, two Lj and one Li would be lengths 1,1,0.5176. Then, checking triangle inequalities:0.5176 +1 &gt;1 =&gt; 1.5176 &gt;1: true1 +1 &gt;0.5176: 2 &gt;0.5176: true1 +0.5176 &gt;1: 1.5176 &gt;1: true.So, all three inequalities hold. So, even if 2Li &lt;= Lj, the triplet with two Lj and one Li is still valid. Therefore, our earlier approach was incorrect. That is, when considering pairs (Li, Lj), even if 2Li &lt;= Lj, triplets with two Lj and one Li are still valid. Therefore, only triplets with two Li and one Lj require the condition 2Li &gt; Lj. The triplets with two Lj and one Li are always valid, since 2Lj &gt; Li is always true (as Lj &gt; Li).Therefore, this changes the approach. For pairs (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j (Li &lt; Lj):- The number of triplets with two Li and one Lj is C(count(Li), 2) * count(Lj). These triplets are valid only if 2Li &gt; Lj.- The number of triplets with two Lj and one Li is C(count(Lj), 2) * count(Li). These triplets are always valid, regardless of the relationship between Li and Lj.Therefore, for each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:- The valid triplets are:   - If 2Li &gt; Lj: C(count(Li), 2)*count(Lj) + C(count(Lj), 2)*count(Li)   - If 2Li ≤ Lj: 0 + C(count(Lj), 2)*count(Li) = C(count(Lj), 2)*count(Li)So, this is an important correction. Therefore, when calculating the number of triplets with two of one length and one of another, for each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:- The triplets with two Li and one Lj are valid only if 2Li &gt; Lj.- The triplets with two Lj and one Li are always valid.Therefore, the total number of valid triplets for each pair (Li, Lj) is:- If 2Li &gt; Lj: C(c(Li),2)*c(Lj) + C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li)- If 2Li ≤ Lj: C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li)Therefore, this changes our previous approach.So, now, for each pair (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j, we need to compute:If 2Li &gt; Lj:   total += C(c(Li),2)*c(Lj) + C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li)Else:   total += C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li)So, we need to recast our previous analysis. Let&#39;s go back to the pairs (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j and check for each if 2Li &gt; Lj. Then compute accordingly.Given the lengths as:L1 ≈0.5176, L2=1, L3≈1.4142, L4≈1.732, L5≈1.9319, L6=2.So, let&#39;s recompute the validity for each pair:1. (L1, L2): 2*0.5176 ≈1.035 &gt;1 (L2). So, valid. Therefore, compute C(12,2)*12 + C(12,2)*12 = 66*12 +66*12 = 1584.Wait, but C(12,2) = 66. So, for each pair (Li, Lj) where i &lt; j and 2Li &gt; Lj:Triplet counts: 66*12 +66*12 = 1584.Wait, but hold on, for pair (Li, Lj):If 2Li &gt; Lj, then triplets with two Li and one Lj: C(12,2)*12 = 66*12=792And triplets with two Lj and one Li: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792Total: 792 +792=1584.If 2Li &lt;= Lj, then only triplets with two Lj and one Li: C(12,2)*12=792.But wait, for example, for pair (L1, L3):2*L1 ≈1.035 &lt; L3≈1.414. Therefore, only triplets with two L3 and one L1: C(12,2)*12=66*12=792.But wait, L3&#39;s count is 12, so C(12,2)=66, multiplied by L1&#39;s count 12: 66*12=792.Wait, but for pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:If 2Li &gt; Lj: then both two Li and one Lj, and two Lj and one Li are valid.But if 2Li &lt;= Lj: then only two Lj and one Li are valid.Therefore, we need to compute for each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:If 2Li &gt; Lj: add 792 +792=1584Else: add 792.But wait, no. Wait, if i &lt; j, Li &lt; Lj:For two Li and one Lj: count is C(c(Li),2)*c(Lj) = C(12,2)*12=66*12=792 (if Li is one of L1-L5, which have 12 segments each). For Lj as well, c(Lj)=12 or 6 (if Lj is L6). Wait, hold on. Wait, the counts for the lengths:Li for i=1 to 5 have 12 segments each, and L6 has 6 segments. Therefore, for pairs where Lj is L6, c(Lj)=6. Therefore, we need to adjust for when Lj is L6.So, actually, the formula is:For a pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j:If Lj ≠ L6:   If 2Li &gt; Lj: number of triplets is C(c(Li),2)*c(Lj) + C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li) = C(12,2)*12 + C(12,2)*12 = 66*12 +66*12=1584.   Else: number of triplets is C(c(Lj),2)*c(Li)=66*12=792.If Lj = L6 (i.e., pair (Li, L6)):   c(Lj)=6, so:   If 2Li &gt; L6: C(12,2)*6 + C(6,2)*12.   Else: C(6,2)*12.But for Li &lt; L6, so i=1 to 5.Wait, let&#39;s handle pairs where Lj = L6 separately.First, pairs where Lj ≠ L6:For i &lt; j, j ≠6. There are C(5,2)=10 such pairs? Wait, no. Wait, total pairs (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j are 15. Out of which, the pairs where Lj = L6 are (L1, L6), (L2, L6), (L3, L6), (L4, L6), (L5, L6). So, 5 pairs where Lj = L6.For these 5 pairs, Lj = L6 (count=6). So, compute accordingly.So, let&#39;s split the pairs into two groups:Group 1: Pairs where Lj ≠ L6 (i.e., j=2 to 5). Total pairs: 15 -5=10 pairs.Wait, no. Wait, the total number of pairs (Li, Lj) with i &lt; j is 15. Out of these, the pairs where Lj = L6 are 5 (since i can be 1 to 5). The remaining 10 pairs are those where Lj ≠ L6 (i.e., j=2 to 5). Wait, no. For example, (L1, L2), (L1, L3), ..., (L1, L5), (L2, L3), ..., (L4, L5). There are C(5,2) +5*5=?? Wait, no. Wait, for n=6 elements, the total pairs are C(6,2)=15. If we exclude the 5 pairs where Lj=L6, then the remaining pairs are 10. Wait, no, 15 total pairs. If Lj=L6 is 5 pairs (i=1-5, j=6). The other 10 pairs are those where both Li and Lj are among L1-L5. So, pairs (L1,L2), (L1,L3), ..., (L4,L5). Which are C(5,2)=10 pairs. So, group 1: 10 pairs where Lj ≠ L6; group 2: 5 pairs where Lj = L6.Therefore, for group 1 (Lj ≠ L6, i.e., j=2 to 5):For each pair (Li, Lj), i &lt; j &lt;=5:Compute if 2Li &gt; Lj. If yes, then number of triplets is 1584 (as c(Li)=12, c(Lj)=12). If no, then 792.But wait, c(Lj)=12 for Lj up to L5. So yes.For group 2 (Lj = L6):For each pair (Li, L6), i=1 to 5:Compute if 2Li &gt; L6. If yes, then number of triplets is C(12,2)*6 + C(6,2)*12. Else, number of triplets is C(6,2)*12.Now, let&#39;s process each group.Group 1: Lj ≠ L6 (10 pairs). Let&#39;s list these pairs and determine if 2Li &gt; Lj.From our previous analysis, in group 1 (Lj ≠ L6), the pairs are:1. (L1, L2)2. (L1, L3)3. (L1, L4)4. (L1, L5)5. (L2, L3)6. (L2, L4)7. (L2, L5)8. (L3, L4)9. (L3, L5)10. (L4, L5)From earlier:1. (L1, L2): 2L1≈1.035 &gt; L2=1? Yes.2. (L1, L3): 1.035 &lt; L3≈1.4142. No.3. (L1, L4): 1.035 &lt;1.732. No.4. (L1, L5): 1.035 &lt;1.9319. No.5. (L2, L3): 2*1=2 &gt;1.4142. Yes.6. (L2, L4): 2 &gt;1.732. Yes.7. (L2, L5): 2 &gt;1.9319. Yes.8. (L3, L4): 2*1.414≈2.828 &gt;1.732. Yes.9. (L3, L5): 2.828 &gt;1.9319. Yes.10. (L4, L5): 2*1.732≈3.464 &gt;1.9319. Yes.So, in group 1, pairs 1,5,6,7,8,9,10 are valid (2Li &gt; Lj). Pairs 2,3,4 are invalid.So, out of 10 pairs in group 1:Valid: 7 pairsInvalid: 3 pairsTherefore, for group 1:Valid pairs (7): each contributes 1584 triplets.Invalid pairs (3): each contributes 792 triplets.So, total for group 1: 7*1584 +3*792.Compute:7*1584: 1584*7=11,0883*792=2,376Total:11,088 +2,376=13,464Now, group 2: pairs (Li, L6), i=1 to5:Check if 2Li &gt; L6=2.So:1. i=1: 2*L1≈1.035 &gt;2? No.2. i=2: 2*L2=2*1=2 &gt;2? No.3. i=3: 2*L3≈2.828 &gt;2? Yes.4. i=4: 2*L4≈3.464 &gt;2? Yes.5. i=5: 2*L5≈3.8638 &gt;2? Yes.So, pairs (L3, L6), (L4, L6), (L5, L6) satisfy 2Li &gt; L6.Pairs (L1, L6), (L2, L6) do not.Therefore, for group 2:For i=1: triplet count = C(6,2)*12 =15*12=180For i=2: triplet count =15*12=180For i=3: valid, so triplet count= C(12,2)*6 +C(6,2)*12=66*6 +15*12=396 +180=576For i=4: same as i=3: 576For i=5: same as i=3: 576Therefore, group 2 total:i=1:180i=2:180i=3:576i=4:576i=5:576Total:180+180=360; 576*3=1,728; total=360+1,728=2,088Therefore, the total number of valid triplets with two of one length and one of another is group1 + group2=13,464 +2,088=15,552.Now, moving on to the third category: triplets with all three different lengths. So, we need to consider all triplets (Li, Lj, Lk) with i &lt; j &lt; k. For each such triplet, we need to check if Li + Lj &gt; Lk. If so, then the number of triplets is count(Li)*count(Lj)*count(Lk).First, let&#39;s find how many such triplets (Li, Lj, Lk) satisfy Li + Lj &gt; Lk.Given the lengths L1 ≈0.5176, L2=1, L3≈1.4142, L4≈1.732, L5≈1.9319, L6=2.So, we need to check for each combination of three different lengths (sorted) whether the sum of the two smaller ones is greater than the largest one.There are C(6,3)=20 possible triplets. Let&#39;s list them all:1. L1, L2, L3: 0.5176 +1 &gt;1.4142? 1.5176 &gt;1.4142: yes.2. L1, L2, L4: 0.5176 +1=1.5176 &gt;1.732? No.3. L1, L2, L5: 1.5176 &gt;1.9319? No.4. L1, L2, L6: 1.5176 &gt;2?

L1, L4, L6:2.2496 &gt;2? Yes.10. L1, L5, L6:0.5176 +1.9319≈2.4495 &gt;2? Yes.11. L2, L3, L4:1 +1.4142≈2.4142 &gt;1.732? Yes.12. L2, L3, L5:2.4142 &gt;1.9319? Yes.13. L2, L3, L6:2.4142 &gt;2? Yes.14. L2, L4, L5:1 +1.732≈2.732 &gt;1.9319? Yes.15. L2, L4, L6:2.732 &gt;2? Yes.16. L2, L5, L6:1 +1.9319≈2.9319 &gt;2? Yes.17. L3, L4, L5:1.4142 +1.732≈3.1462 &gt;1.9319? Yes.18. L3, L4, L6:3.1462 &gt;2? Yes.19. L3, L5, L6:1.4142 +1.9319≈3.3461 &gt;2? Yes.20. L4, L5, L6:1.732 +1.9319≈3.6639 &gt;2? Yes.Now, let&#39;s check which of these satisfy Li + Lj &gt; Lk:1. Yes5. Yes8. Yes9. Yes10. Yes11. Yes12. Yes13. Yes14. Yes15. Yes16. Yes17. Yes18. Yes19. Yes20. YesSo, the invalid triplets are:2. L1, L2, L4: No3. L1, L2, L5: No4. L1, L2, L6: No6. L1, L3, L5: No7. L1, L3, L6: NoSo, out of 20 triplets, 5 are invalid. Therefore, 15 valid triplets.Now, for each valid triplet (Li, Lj, Lk), compute the number of triplets as count(Li)*count(Lj)*count(Lk). Note that count(Li)=12 for i=1-5, and count(L6)=6.Let&#39;s go through each valid triplet:1. L1, L2, L3:12*12*12=1,7285. L1, L3, L4:12*12*12=1,7288. L1, L4, L5:12*12*12=1,7289. L1, L4, L6:12*12*6=864 (since L6 has count 6)10. L1, L5, L6:12*12*6=86411. L2, L3, L4:12*12*12=1,72812. L2, L3, L5:12*12*12=1,72813. L2, L3, L6:12*12*6=86414. L2, L4, L5:12*12*12=1,72815. L2, L4, L6:12*12*6=86416. L2, L5, L6:12*12*6=86417. L3, L4, L5:12*12*12=1,72818. L3, L4, L6:12*12*6=86419. L3, L5, L6:12*12*6=86420. L4, L5, L6:12*12*6=864Let&#39;s calculate each:1. 1,7285. 1,7288. 1,7289. 86410. 86411. 1,72812. 1,72813. 86414. 1,72815. 86416. 86417. 1,72818. 86419. 86420. 864Now, let&#39;s count how many of each:- 1,728 occurs: positions 1,5,8,11,12,14,17. That&#39;s 7 times.7 *1,728=12,096- 864 occurs: positions 9,10,13,15,16,18,19,20. That&#39;s 8 times.8*864=6,912Total for different lengths:12,096 +6,912=19,008Therefore, the total number of valid triplets is:- All same length:1,120- Two same, one different:15,552- All different:19,008Total valid:1,120 +15,552 +19,008=35,680But wait, let&#39;s check the addition:1,120 +15,552=16,67216,672 +19,008=35,680Therefore, the total number of valid triplets is 35,680.The total number of triplets is 45,760.Therefore, the probability is 35,680 /45,760.Let&#39;s simplify this fraction.First, divide numerator and denominator by 16:35,680 ÷16=2,230; 45,760 ÷16=2,860.So, 2,230/2,860. Then divide numerator and denominator by 10:223/286.Check if this reduces further. Let&#39;s see the GCD of 223 and 286.286 ÷223=1, remainder 63223 ÷63=3, remainder 3463 ÷34=1, remainder2934 ÷29=1, remainder529 ÷5=5, remainder45 ÷4=1, remainder14 ÷1=4, remainder0. So GCD is1.Therefore, 223/286 is in simplest form. Wait, but 223 is a prime number? Let&#39;s check: 223 is not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. sqrt(223)≈14.93. So, it&#39;s prime. 286=2*11*13. So, no common factors. Therefore, 223/286 is reduced.But let me check the original division:35,680 ÷16=2,230 (16*2,230=35,680)45,760 ÷16=2,860 (16*2,860=45,760)Yes.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let&#39;s verify the total valid triplets:All same:1,120Two-one:15,552All different:19,008Sum:1,120 +15,552=16,672; 16,672 +19,008=35,680. Yes.Total triplets:45,760.So, 35,680/45,760. Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 160:35,680 ÷160=223;45,760 ÷160=286. So, yes, 223/286≈0.7797.But let&#39;s check:223/286≈0.7797But let&#39;s verify whether our counts are correct. Wait, 35,680 divided by 45,760 is exactly 0.7797 approximately. However, let&#39;s check the individual components again to ensure no miscalculations.First, all same length triplets:5*C(12,3) +C(6,3)=5*220 +20=1,120. Correct.Two-one triplets:Group1:13,464Group2:2,088Total:15,552. Correct.All different triplets:19,008. Correct.Total valid:35,680.But wait, 35,680 /45,760= 0.7797 approximately. But let&#39;s see if we can write this fraction in simpler terms. Since 35,680 = 35,680 and 45,760 =45,760.Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 35,680/16=2,230;45,760/16=2,860.2,230 /2,860= (2,230 ÷10)/(2,860 ÷10)=223/286.But 223 is a prime number. So, the fraction is 223/286≈0.7797.But let&#39;s confirm once more the counts, because getting approximately 77.97% probability seems high, but considering that many triplets with larger lengths would satisfy the triangle inequality, maybe it&#39;s reasonable.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if the all-different triplets count is correct.All-different triplets that are valid:15 triplets. Each triplet&#39;s count:Triplets involving L6:L1, L4, L6:12*12*6=864L1, L5, L6: sameL2, L3, L6: sameL2, L4, L6: sameL2, L5, L6: sameL3, L4, L6: sameL3, L5, L6: sameL4, L5, L6: sameSo, there are 8 triplets involving L6, each contributing 864. 8*864=6,912The remaining 7 triplets not involving L6:L1, L2, L3:1,728L1, L3, L4:1,728L1, L4, L5:1,728L2, L3, L4:1,728L2, L3, L5:1,728L2, L4, L5:1,728L3, L4, L5:1,728So, 7*1,728=12,096Total:12,096 +6,912=19,008. Correct.Thus, the counts seem correct.Therefore, the probability is 223/286. But let&#39;s check if this reduces further. Since 223 is prime, and 286=2×11×13. 223 doesn&#39;t divide 286, so it&#39;s irreducible.But just to cross-verify, 223×286=223*(200+80+6)=223*200=44,600; 223*80=17,840; 223*6=1,338. Total:44,600+17,840=62,440+1,338=63,778. But 223*286=63,778, which is not equal to 35,680*286= wait, no, sorry. But since 223/286 is the reduced form, the probability is 223/286.But let me check if there is a mistake in counting the valid triplets. For example, when we considered two-one triplets, group1 had 13,464 and group2 had 2,088, totaling 15,552. Then all-different triplets are19,008. Same-length triplets 1,120. Sum is35,680. Total triplets45,760. So yes, 35,680/45,760=223/286≈0.7797. So, the probability is 223/286.But wait, the problem says &quot;three different segments are randomly selected&quot;. But in our calculation, we considered combinations where segments are different, but lengths can be same. The problem says &quot;three different segments&quot;, so different in terms of segments, not necessarily different lengths. So, our approach is correct.Alternatively, the answer might be presented in a reduced fraction or a decimal. But 223 and 286. Let&#39;s see if 223 divides 286. 286 ÷223≈1.28. So, no. Therefore, 223/286 is the simplest form.Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected as a reduced fraction. Let&#39;s check if 223 and 286 have a common factor:223 is a prime number. Let&#39;s check 223 divides 286?286 -223=63. 223 doesn&#39;t divide 63. So, GCD is1.Therefore, the probability is 223/286.But let me cross-validate this with approximate decimal. 223 divided by286:223 ÷286≈0.7797, which is approximately77.97%.But the problem might expect the answer in a different form. Wait, perhaps we can simplify further by dividing numerator and denominator by something else. Wait, 223 is a prime, so unless I made a mistake in calculation, it can&#39;t be reduced.But maybe I made a mistake in the counts. Let me check group2&#39;s two-one triplets.Group2 was the pairs (Li, L6). For i=1: invalid, so count=C(6,2)*12=15*12=180i=2: same,180i=3: valid, so C(12,2)*6 +C(6,2)*12=66*6 +15*12=396 +180=576i=4: same as i=3:576i=5: same as i=3:576Therefore, group2 total:180+180+576+576+576=180+180=360;576*3=1,728;360+1,728=2,088. Correct.Group1 was 13,464. All correct.All-different triplets:19,008. Same-length:1,120.Total valid:35,680.Thus, 35,680/45,760=223/286≈0.7797.Hmm. This seems correct. But let me check with another approach.Alternatively, compute the probability as (Number of valid)/(Total). Let me check if 35,680 is correct.But considering that the probability is over 3/4, which seems high. Maybe that&#39;s possible.Alternatively, perhaps I messed up with the two-one triplets. Let me check one pair:For example, pair (L3, L6):Since 2*L3≈2.828 &gt; L6=2, so valid. Therefore, the number of triplets is C(12,2)*6 +C(6,2)*12=66*6 +15*12=396 +180=576. Correct.Another example, pair (L2, L3):Valid, so 1584. Correct.So, perhaps the counts are correct.Therefore, the answer is 223/286.But let me see if the problem expects the answer in another form. Let me compute 223 divided by 286:223 ÷286 = 0.77972...So, approximately 77.97%.But the problem might want the fraction in simplest form, which is 223/286. Let me check if that&#39;s the case.But just to make sure, 223 is prime. 286=2×11×13. 223 is not a multiple of 2,11, or13. So, yes, 223/286 is reduced.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as boxed{dfrac{223}{286}}.But I should check if there is an error in the calculation. For example, in the all-different triplets, perhaps some of the triplets that I considered valid are actually invalid.Let me recheck some of the border cases:For example, triplet L1, L3, L5: Li +Lj= L1 + L3≈0.5176 +1.4142≈1.9318. L5≈1.9319. So, 1.9318 &lt;1.9319. Therefore, invalid. So, that triplet is invalid. But in my previous analysis, I considered triplet L1, L3, L5 as invalid (number6). Correct.Similarly, triplet L1, L4, L5: Li + Lj=0.5176 +1.732≈2.2496&gt;1.9319. Yes, valid.Triplet L1, L4, L6:0.5176 +1.732≈2.2496&gt;2. Yes.Triplet L1, L5, L6:0.5176 +1.9319≈2.4495&gt;2. Yes.Triplet L2, L3, L4:1 +1.414≈2.414&gt;1.732. Yes.Triplet L2, L3, L5:1 +1.414≈2.414&gt;1.9319. Yes.Triplet L2, L3, L6: same sum≈2.414&gt;2. Yes.Triplet L2, L4, L5:1 +1.732≈2.732&gt;1.9319. Yes.Etc. All other triplets seem to check out.Therefore, the calculation is correct.Therefore, the probability is 223/286, which is the final answer.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{223}{286}}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding the probability that three randomly selected different segments (sides or diagonals) from a regular 12-sided polygon can form a triangle, we follow these steps:1. Total Number of Segments:   - A regular 12-sided polygon has 12 sides and 54 diagonals, giving a total of 66 segments.   - The total number of ways to choose three different segments is ( binom{66}{3} = 45760 ).2. Distinct Lengths and Their Counts:   - The segments have 6 distinct lengths (denoted ( L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5, L_6 )) with counts:     - ( L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5 ): 12 each     - ( L_6 ): 63. Valid Triplets:   - All segments of the same length: Valid as they form an equilateral triangle.     - Total: ( 5 times binom{12}{3} + binom{6}{3} = 1120 )   - Two segments of one length and one of another:     - Check if ( 2 times text{min}(L_i, L_j) &gt; text{max}(L_i, L_j) )     - Valid pairs contribute ( binom{12}{2} times 12 + binom{12}{2} times 12 ) or ( binom{6}{2} times 12 )     - Total: 15552   - All segments of different lengths:     - Check if ( L_i + L_j &gt; L_k ) for sorted lengths ( L_i leq L_j leq L_k )     - Valid triplets contribute ( 12 times 12 times 12 ) or ( 12 times 12 times 6 )     - Total: 190084. Total Valid Triplets:   - Sum of all valid triplets: ( 1120 + 15552 + 19008 = 35680 )5. Probability Calculation:   - Probability = ( frac{35680}{45760} = frac{223}{286} )Thus, the probability that three randomly selected different segments form a triangle is (boxed{dfrac{223}{286}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🔑:</span>7. frac{223}{286}.Let the diameter of the circumscribed circle of a regular 12-sided polygon be 1.

So, there&#39;s a cube with a fly on each vertex. When the whistle blows, each fly moves to a diagonally opposite vertex on the same face. We need to find the number of ways they can do this such that no two flies end up at the same vertex. Hmm, interesting.First, let me visualize a cube. A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each face is a square with 4 vertices. Each vertex is part of 3 different faces. So, each fly is on 3 faces. When the whistle blows, each fly has to move to a diagonal vertex on the same face as the previous one. Wait, the problem says &quot;in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot; Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Is each fly moving to a vertex that&#39;s diagonally opposite on the same face as the vertex it was previously on? Or does &quot;previous one&quot; refer to the previous position of the same fly?Wait, let me read the problem again: &quot;each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot; Hmm. Maybe &quot;previous one&quot; refers to the previous vertex? So, the fly is on a vertex that&#39;s part of a face, and it moves to the diagonally opposite vertex on that same face. But each vertex is part of three faces, so does the fly have three choices? But the problem says &quot;the same face as the previous one.&quot; Wait, maybe &quot;the same face as the previous one&quot; refers to the face they were on before moving? So each fly was on a vertex, which is part of three faces. When the whistle blows, they move to a diagonally opposite vertex on one of those three faces? Wait, no. The problem states: &quot;each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot; So, &quot;the previous one&quot; must be the previous vertex. So, the fly is on a vertex (the previous one), which is part of a face, and moves to the diagonally opposite vertex on that same face. Wait, but each vertex is part of three faces, so does each fly have three possible moves? But the problem says &quot;in the same face as the previous one.&quot; So, the fly was on a vertex (previous one) which is part of a face, and moves to the diagonally opposite vertex on that same face. Wait, but each vertex is part of three faces. So, maybe the fly has three possible directions to move? But then, each fly would have three choices? But the problem is asking for the number of ways the flies can change position so that there&#39;s no vertex with two or more flies. So, each fly must move to a new vertex such that all destinations are unique.Wait, but if each fly can choose among three different diagonally opposite vertices on the same face, but we need permutations where no two flies end up at the same vertex. So, we need to count the number of derangements where each fly moves to one of three possible vertices, but such that all movements are permutations (bijections) of the vertices. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such permutations.Alternatively, maybe the movement is constrained such that each fly must move along a face diagonal. But each fly is on a vertex, which is part of three faces, each of which has a diagonal. So, each fly has three possible diagonals to move along. However, moving along a diagonal on one face might cause conflicts with other flies.Wait, but perhaps the cube&#39;s structure imposes some constraints. Let me think. Let&#39;s label the cube&#39;s vertices. Maybe using coordinates. Let’s consider a cube with vertices at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1). Each vertex can be represented by a binary triplet. Each face is defined by fixing one coordinate. For example, the face x=0 has vertices (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1). The diagonals on this face are (0,0,0)-(0,1,1) and (0,0,1)-(0,1,0). Similarly, for each face.Now, each vertex is part of three faces. For example, (0,0,0) is part of x=0, y=0, and z=0 faces. The diagonally opposite vertices on each of these faces would be:- On x=0 face: (0,1,1)- On y=0 face: (1,0,1)- On z=0 face: (1,1,0)So, from (0,0,0), the fly can move to (0,1,1), (1,0,1), or (1,1,0). Similarly, each vertex has three possible moves, each corresponding to moving along a diagonal of one of the three faces it&#39;s on.Therefore, each fly has three choices. However, moving to these positions might result in conflicts where two flies end up at the same vertex. The problem is asking for the number of such movement combinations where no two flies occupy the same vertex after moving.Therefore, the total number of possible movement combinations is 3^8, but we need to subtract those combinations where at least two flies end up at the same vertex. However, inclusion-exclusion for 8 flies would be complicated. But maybe there&#39;s a symmetry or a pattern here.Alternatively, perhaps this problem is related to the cube&#39;s automorphism group or something like that.Alternatively, maybe we can model each move as a permutation. Each fly&#39;s movement is determined by selecting one of the three possible face diagonals. However, not all combinations result in a permutation. We need the overall movement to be a permutation, i.e., a bijection from the set of vertices to itself.Therefore, we need to count the number of permutations of the cube&#39;s vertices such that each vertex is mapped to one of its three diagonal opposites on the three faces. So, each permutation must consist of moves along face diagonals.This seems similar to the concept of &quot;derangements&quot; but with specific allowed moves.Alternatively, considering the cube&#39;s graph structure, each vertex is connected via edges to three others (the adjacent vertices), but here we&#39;re considering moves along face diagonals, which connect each vertex to three others (the ones diagonally opposite on each face). So, the graph we&#39;re considering has each vertex connected to three others, forming a different graph structure.Therefore, we need to count the number of perfect matchings (permutations) in this graph where each node is connected to three others. Wait, but a permutation is a set of cycles, not a matching. A perfect matching would be a permutation consisting only of 2-cycles, but here, we are allowing any cycles as long as each element is mapped to one of its neighbors in this graph.But the problem is asking for the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) where each element moves to one of three specific positions. However, fixed points aren&#39;t possible here because moving along a face diagonal always moves the fly to a different vertex. So, every such permutation is automatically a derangement. Wait, is that true?Wait, if a fly moves along a face diagonal, it cannot stay in the same vertex, because diagonally opposite vertex is different. Therefore, every such permutation is a derangement. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of derangements on the cube&#39;s vertices where each vertex is mapped to one of its three diagonal opposites on the faces.But how to count this?Alternatively, notice that each such movement corresponds to a permutation where each vertex is sent to one of three possible vertices. The problem is similar to counting the number of possible permutation matrices in a graph where each node has three outgoing edges. However, this is a #P problem in general, but maybe there&#39;s a clever way for the cube.Alternatively, note that the cube&#39;s diagonally opposite vertices on faces form a system where each permutation is composed of moves along these diagonals. Let me think about the structure.Let me think about the cube&#39;s diagonals. Each face has two diagonals. Each vertex is part of three faces, so each vertex is the endpoint of three face diagonals. Thus, from each vertex, there are three possible moves: along each of the three face diagonals it&#39;s part of. The graph formed by these moves is a regular graph of degree 3, with 8 nodes. What is this graph?Wait, in the cube, each vertex is connected via face diagonals to three others. For example, take vertex (0,0,0). As before, it is connected via face diagonals to (0,1,1), (1,0,1), and (1,1,0). Let me check the connections for another vertex. Take (0,0,1). It is part of the faces x=0, y=0, and z=1. The diagonally opposite vertices on these faces would be:- On x=0 face: (0,1,0)- On y=0 face: (1,0,0)- On z=1 face: (1,1,1)So, (0,0,1) is connected to (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,1).Similarly, (1,1,1) is connected via face diagonals to (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Wait, this seems like each vertex is connected to three others. Let me check if these connections are reciprocal. For example, (0,0,0) is connected to (0,1,1), which in turn is connected back to (0,0,0) via the x=0 face diagonal. Similarly, (0,1,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (1,1,0), and (1,0,1). So, yes, the connections are symmetric. Therefore, this graph is undirected, regular of degree 3, with 8 vertices.Now, what is this graph? It is known that the cube can form different graphs when considering different connections. Let me recall that the cube&#39;s vertices and edges form a graph known as the cube graph, which is regular of degree 3. However, in our case, the graph is different because the edges are the face diagonals. Wait, no. The original cube graph has edges as the cube&#39;s edges (adjacent vertices), but here, we are considering edges as the face diagonals. Therefore, this is a different graph. Let&#39;s see.In the original cube graph, each vertex is connected to three others via edges of the cube. In our case, each vertex is connected to three others via face diagonals. So, this is a different graph. Let&#39;s see if this graph is a known one.The graph we&#39;re considering has 8 vertices, each connected to three others. Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s bipartite. Let&#39;s check if the vertices can be divided into two sets with no edges within each set. Let&#39;s take the standard cube&#39;s bipartition: in the cube graph, the two sets are the even and odd Hamming weight vertices. Let me see:Vertices with even Hamming weight: (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0)Vertices with odd Hamming weight: (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,1)Now, let&#39;s see if in our face diagonal graph, edges go between even and odd. Let&#39;s take a vertex from the even set, say (0,0,0). It is connected to (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0). Wait, all of these are in the even set. Because, for example, (0,1,1) has two 1s, which is even. Similarly, (1,0,1) and (1,1,0) each have two 1s, even. So, (0,0,0) is connected only to even vertices. Similarly, take a vertex from the odd set, say (0,0,1). It is connected to (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,1). All of these are in the odd set: (0,1,0) has two 0s and one 1, which is odd. (1,0,0) is similar. (1,1,1) has three 1s, odd. So, in this graph, the edges are within each bipartition. Therefore, the graph is composed of two disconnected components, each being a complete graph? Wait, but each component has four vertices, each connected to three others within the component. So, each component is a complete graph K4? Wait, no. In K4, each vertex is connected to three others, but in our case, each vertex is connected to three others, but not all possible. Let&#39;s check.Take the even component: vertices (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0). Let&#39;s see the connections:- (0,0,0) is connected to (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0)- (0,1,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1)- (1,0,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,1,0)- (1,1,0) is connected to (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1)So, in this component, every pair of vertices is connected except the ones that are not diagonally opposite on a face. Wait, but in this component, each vertex is connected to three others. In K4, each vertex is connected to three others, so this is indeed K4. Wait, but in reality, in our graph, is (0,1,1) connected to (1,0,1)? Let&#39;s check. From (0,1,1), moving along a face diagonal: (0,1,1) is part of faces x=0, y=1, z=1. The diagonally opposite vertices on these faces are:- On x=0 face: (0,0,0)- On y=1 face: (1,1,0)- On z=1 face: (1,1,0) [Wait, no. On the z=1 face, which includes (0,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,1). The diagonally opposite vertex to (0,1,1) on z=1 is (1,0,1). Wait, but (0,1,1) is on the z=1 face. The diagonally opposite vertex on that face would be (1,0,1). Wait, but according to earlier, (0,1,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (1,1,0), and (1,0,1). So, yes, (0,1,1) is connected to (1,0,1). Similarly, (1,0,1) is connected to (0,1,1). Therefore, in the even component, every vertex is connected to the other three. Hence, the even component is a complete graph K4. Similarly, the odd component is also a complete graph K4. Therefore, the graph we&#39;re considering is two disjoint copies of K4.Wait, that can&#39;t be. Because in a K4, every pair of vertices is connected, but in our case, each vertex is only connected to three others via face diagonals, which might not include all possible pairs. Wait, but in the even component, each vertex is connected to the other three, which would form a K4. Let me check with specific examples:Take (0,0,0). It is connected to (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0). So, three connections. Then, (0,1,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1). So, same three. Similarly, (1,0,1) is connected to (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,1,0). And (1,1,0) is connected to (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1). So indeed, in the even component, all four vertices are connected to each other. Therefore, the even component is a complete graph K4, and similarly, the odd component is a K4.But wait, in reality, in the cube, moving along face diagonals, each vertex is connected only to three others. But in the even component, which is a K4, each vertex is connected to three others. Wait, in a K4, each vertex is connected to three others, which matches. So, this graph is two disjoint K4s.But wait, the original cube has all 8 vertices connected via edges, but in our case, the graph is split into two disconnected components, each a K4. That&#39;s interesting. Therefore, when the flies move along face diagonals, they can only move within their own component. That is, the even Hamming weight vertices can only move to other even Hamming weight vertices, and the odd ones can only move to other odd ones. Therefore, the permutation must consist of permutations within each component. Therefore, the total number of possible permutations is the number of permutations of the even component multiplied by the number of permutations of the odd component.But each component is a K4, so the number of permutations of each component is the number of derangements of 4 elements, but with the constraint that each element is mapped to one of its three neighbors. Wait, but in the K4, every element is connected to every other element, so in the graph, each node is connected to all others. Therefore, the number of derangements of 4 elements where each element can go to any of the other three. Wait, but derangements of 4 elements are all permutations with no fixed points, which is 9. But in our case, each element can only go to three specific positions (its neighbors in the graph). But in the K4, all other three vertices are neighbors. Therefore, the derangements of 4 elements where each element is mapped to any of the three others. Wait, but in that case, the number of derangements would just be the number of derangements of 4 elements, which is 9. However, in a K4 graph, where each node can go to any other node, the number of derangements is 9. However, in our case, since the graph is K4, any permutation that is a derangement is allowed. Therefore, the number of derangements within each K4 is 9.But wait, is that correct? Wait, the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) of 4 elements is indeed 9. So, if each component has 4 elements, and the allowed permutations are derangements within each component, then each component can have 9 derangements. Therefore, the total number of permutations is 9 * 9 = 81.But wait, the problem states that each fly must move to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite. However, in our graph, we split the cube into two K4 components, each corresponding to the even and odd Hamming weight vertices. But do the derangements within each K4 component correspond to moving along face diagonals? Let me verify.Take the even component: (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0). Suppose we have a permutation where (0,0,0) maps to (0,1,1). Then, in terms of the cube, this is moving along the x=0 face diagonal. Similarly, if (0,0,0) maps to (1,0,1), that&#39;s moving along the y=0 face diagonal, and to (1,1,0), that&#39;s moving along the z=0 face diagonal. Similarly, other vertices can map to any of the three diagonally opposite vertices on their respective faces.But when considering permutations within the even component, since it&#39;s a K4, each vertex can go to any other vertex. However, in the original problem, each fly can only move along one of the three face diagonals. But in the K4 component, each vertex is connected to three others via face diagonals, so each permutation corresponds to a set of moves along these diagonals. However, if we allow any permutation (as long as it&#39;s a derangement), then even though each individual move is along a face diagonal, the permutation as a whole could involve cycles longer than 2. But does such a permutation correspond to each fly moving along a face diagonal independently?Wait, no. Because when you permute the vertices, each vertex is mapped to another vertex via a face diagonal move. However, the permutation as a whole may not be achievable by each fly moving independently. Wait, but in this case, the graph is such that each move is allowed, and permutations correspond to moving each fly along a face diagonal. However, the problem is that when you permute the vertices, you have to ensure that the permutation is consistent. For example, if vertex A moves to vertex B, then vertex B must move to some vertex C, etc., forming a permutation. Therefore, the number of such permutations is the number of derangements (since no fixed points) on each K4 component, which is 9 for each, so total 9*9=81.But wait, in the problem statement, it says &quot;in how many ways can the flies change position so that there is no vertex with 2 or more flies.&quot; So, each fly moves to a vertex via a face diagonal, and we need the resulting positions to be a permutation (i.e., bijection). Therefore, the number is equal to the number of such permutations. Since the graph is two disconnected K4s, the permutations are independent on each K4. Therefore, the number is the number of derangements on each K4 (since moving along a face diagonal cannot result in a fixed point) multiplied together.But wait, in a K4 graph, all permutations (except identity) are derangements? No, the derangements are permutations with no fixed points. For a set of 4 elements, the number of derangements is 9. However, not all derangements can be represented as a product of transpositions (which are swaps). Wait, no. Derangements can have cycles of different lengths. For example, a 4-cycle is a derangement, as are two 2-cycles, or a 3-cycle and a fixed point, but fixed points aren&#39;t allowed here.But in our case, the derangements must consist of moves along edges in the K4 graph. However, in the K4 graph, any permutation is allowed since all vertices are connected. But actually, in graph theory terms, a permutation of the vertices is called an automorphism if it preserves adjacency. However, in our case, we are not restricted to automorphisms; instead, we are considering all possible permutations where each vertex is mapped to one of its neighbors (in the face diagonal graph). This is known as the number of &quot;permutation covers&quot; or &quot;permutation routing&quot; on the graph. However, in general, counting such permutations is difficult, but in our case, since the graph is two K4s, and each K4 is a complete graph, any derangement within a K4 is allowed because every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, in the K4 component, the number of such permutations is the number of derangements of 4 elements, which is 9. Therefore, for each component, it&#39;s 9, so total permutations are 9*9=81.Therefore, the answer should be 81. However, I need to verify this.Wait, let me compute the number of derangements of 4 elements. The formula for derangements is n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n /n!). For n=4, it&#39;s 4! * (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24) = 24 * (0 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417) = 24 * (0.375) = 9. So, yes, 9 derangements for each component. Therefore, 9*9=81.But let me think again. Each K4 component allows any permutation that is a derangement. However, in our problem, the movement is along face diagonals. However, in the K4 graph, each vertex is connected to all others, but in reality, in the cube, each vertex is connected via three face diagonals to three specific vertices. Wait, but in the K4 graph, the edges are the face diagonals. So, moving from a vertex to any other vertex in the K4 is equivalent to moving along a face diagonal. However, in the cube, moving from one vertex to another in the same K4 component requires moving along a face diagonal. Therefore, each edge in the K4 corresponds to a face diagonal move in the cube. Therefore, any permutation within the K4 component can be achieved by composing face diagonal moves.But wait, but if you have a permutation that is a 3-cycle, is that achievable via face diagonals? For example, can a fly move from A to B, B to C, and C to A, each via face diagonals? Let&#39;s check with actual coordinates.Take the even component: (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0). Suppose we have a 3-cycle: (0,0,0) -&gt; (0,1,1) -&gt; (1,0,1) -&gt; (0,0,0). Is this possible? Each move must be along a face diagonal.- (0,0,0) to (0,1,1): this is a move along the x=0 face diagonal.- (0,1,1) to (1,0,1): is this a face diagonal move? (0,1,1) is part of the faces x=0, y=1, z=1. The diagonally opposite vertices are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), and (1,1,0). So, moving from (0,1,1) to (1,0,1) is not a face diagonal move. Because (1,0,1) is not diagonally opposite on any face that (0,1,1) is part of. Therefore, this 3-cycle is not possible.Wait, this is a problem. So, our earlier assumption that any derangement within the K4 component is allowed is incorrect. Because even though the K4 graph has all edges, in reality, the edges correspond to specific face diagonals, and moving from one vertex to another might not be possible via a single face diagonal move. Wait, no. Wait, in the K4 graph, each edge corresponds to a face diagonal move. So, in the even component, each edge is a face diagonal move. Therefore, the graph is the union of all face diagonals in the cube. Therefore, moving along any edge in the K4 graph is a valid face diagonal move.But in the cube, each face diagonal move is between two vertices in the same component. So, for example, moving from (0,1,1) to (1,0,1) would require moving along a face diagonal. Let&#39;s check: (0,1,1) is part of the z=1 face (along with (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,1)). The diagonally opposite vertex on the z=1 face for (0,1,1) is (1,0,1). Therefore, moving from (0,1,1) to (1,0,1) is a valid face diagonal move on the z=1 face. Similarly, moving from (1,0,1) to (1,1,0) would be along the y=0 face? Wait, (1,0,1) is part of the y=0 face (along with (1,0,0), (0,0,0), (0,0,1)). The diagonally opposite vertex on the y=0 face for (1,0,1) is (0,0,0). But moving to (1,1,0) is on the x=1 face. Wait, (1,0,1) is part of the x=1 face (with (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)). The diagonally opposite vertex on the x=1 face for (1,0,1) is (1,1,0). Ah, so moving from (1,0,1) to (1,1,0) is a valid face diagonal move on the x=1 face.Therefore, the K4 graph indeed represents all possible face diagonal moves within each component. Therefore, any permutation within the component that is a derangement can be achieved by composing face diagonal moves. Therefore, even a 3-cycle can be achieved by three face diagonal moves, but each individual move is along a face diagonal.However, in our problem, each fly moves simultaneously when the whistle blows. Therefore, the permutation must be such that each fly moves to its new position in one step, i.e., the permutation is a product of disjoint transpositionsAssuming the original price, we can solve:,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s try to figure out this cube and flies problem. So, we have a cube with a fly on each vertex. When a whistle blows, each fly moves to a diagonally opposite vertex on the same face. After they move, we need to make sure that no vertex has more than one fly. The question is asking how many different ways this can happen. Hmm, okay.First, let me visualize a cube. A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each face is a square, and each vertex is part of three different faces. Now, each fly is at a vertex, and when the whistle blows, they have to move to the diagonally opposite vertex on the same face. Wait, but each vertex is part of three faces. So, does that mean each fly has three possible choices to move to? But the problem says &quot;diagonally opposite to it in the same face as the previous one.&quot; Wait, maybe I need to clarify the movement.Wait, the problem states: &quot;each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot; Hmm, so does &quot;previous one&quot; refer to the previous position of the fly? Or is it the same face as the current one? Maybe I need to parse that sentence again.&quot;each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot;So, &quot;previous one&quot; probably refers to the face the fly was on before the whistle. Wait, but each fly is on a vertex, which is part of three faces. So, if the fly is at a vertex, it&#39;s part of three faces. When the whistle blows, it has to move to a vertex that&#39;s in the same face as the previous one (the face it was on before the whistle) but diagonally opposite. Wait, but each face that the fly was part of has a diagonal. So, each fly has three possible faces to consider, each with a diagonal. So, does each fly have three possible moves? But moving along different face diagonals?Wait, but if the fly moves along the diagonal of the same face it was on before, then each fly has three possible moves? But that might not make sense because each face has only one diagonal. Wait, no, a square face has two diagonals, but each diagonal connects two vertices. So, if the fly is at a vertex, in a given face, the diagonal from that vertex is only one: the opposite vertex. So, for each face the fly is on, moving along the diagonal of that face would take it to the opposite vertex. But since the fly is part of three faces, each face would give a different diagonal move. So, each fly has three possible moves? For example, let&#39;s take a vertex on a cube. Let&#39;s say vertex A is connected to three edges, each leading to adjacent vertices. Each of these edges is part of a face. So, vertex A is part of three faces. For each of those three faces, the diagonally opposite vertex would be different. So, fly at vertex A can move to three different vertices, each diagonally opposite in each of the three faces that include A. Is that correct?Wait, let me confirm with an example. Let&#39;s take vertex (0,0,0) in a cube with coordinates from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The three adjacent vertices are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The three faces that include (0,0,0) are the front face (z=0), left face (y=0), and bottom face (x=0). The diagonally opposite vertex on the front face (z=0) would be (1,1,0). On the left face (y=0), it would be (1,0,1). On the bottom face (x=0), it would be (0,1,1). So, from (0,0,0), the fly can move to (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1). Yes, three possible moves. Each of these is diagonally opposite on one of the three faces that include the original vertex.So, each fly has three possible moves. However, the problem states that after moving, there should be no vertex with two or more flies. So, we need to find the number of ways the flies can move such that all moves result in a permutation of the vertices with no conflicts.In other words, we need to count the number of permutations of the 8 vertices where each permutation consists of moves where each fly moves to a diagonally opposite vertex on one of the three faces containing its original vertex, and such that no two flies end up at the same vertex.This seems related to derangements, but with additional constraints on the movement.First, let&#39;s note that each move for a fly is a translation along a face diagonal. However, on a cube, moving along a face diagonal from a vertex leads to another vertex, and these moves can be thought of as specific permutations.But since each fly has three choices, the total number of possible movements without considering collisions would be 3^8. However, we need to subtract the cases where two or more flies end up at the same vertex.But instead of inclusion-exclusion, which might be complicated here, maybe there&#39;s a more combinatorial way to approach this.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each vertex (fly) has three edges corresponding to its three possible moves, and we need to count the number of perfect matchings or derangements in this graph. But perfect matchings are usually for pairing, but here we have permutations.Wait, actually, since each fly must go to another vertex, and no two flies can go to the same vertex, we need a derangement where each element is moved according to one of the three possible face diagonals. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of derangements using the allowed moves.However, derangements are permutations where no element is in its original position, but here the allowed permutations are those where each element is moved to one of three specific positions (the diagonally opposite vertices on each face). So, it&#39;s a more constrained problem.Alternatively, maybe we can model the cube&#39;s vertices and their possible movements. Let&#39;s consider that each vertex can move to three others. So, the cube&#39;s graph has edges between each vertex and the three vertices diagonally opposite on each face. Then, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of perfect matchings in this graph. Wait, but perfect matchings are sets of edges that cover all vertices without overlapping. However, here we need a permutation, which is a directed cycle cover of the graph. But since the graph is undirected, but we need a permutation, which is a directed cycle cover where each vertex has in-degree and out-degree 1.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the number of derangements where each movement is along one of the three allowed face diagonals. So, perhaps the cube&#39;s movement graph is a regular graph of degree 3, and we need the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) that are also automorphisms of the cube? Wait, no. The automorphisms of the cube include rotations and reflections, but here we are moving each fly along specific edges (the face diagonals). Wait, but the movement is not along edges but along face diagonals. Each face diagonal is a move to a vertex two edges away.Wait, in the cube, the distance between two vertices connected by a face diagonal is 2 edges (they are diagonally opposite on a face). So, each move is a distance of 2. So, each fly moves two edges away along a face.But how does this affect the permutation? Let&#39;s think about the cube&#39;s structure.Each vertex is connected via face diagonals to three other vertices. So, the graph we&#39;re considering has each vertex connected to three others. Let&#39;s try to model this.Perhaps we can represent the cube&#39;s vertices as binary triplets (x,y,z) where x, y, z ∈ {0,1}. Then, moving along a face diagonal would correspond to flipping two coordinates. For example, moving along the front face (z=0) from (0,0,0) would flip x and y, resulting in (1,1,0). Similarly, moving along the left face (y=0) would flip x and z, resulting in (1,0,1), and moving along the bottom face (x=0) would flip y and z, resulting in (0,1,1). So, in general, each move flips two coordinates.So, each move is equivalent to flipping two coordinates. Therefore, the possible moves for each fly correspond to flipping two of the three coordinates. Therefore, the movement graph is such that each vertex is connected to three others, each differing in two coordinates.This is actually the same as the graph formed by the cube&#39;s &quot;square faces&#39; diagonals&quot;. Now, in such a graph, each vertex is connected to three others. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of derangements (permutations without fixed points) on this graph, where each element is mapped to one of its three neighbors.This seems related to the concept of derangements on a graph, where the permutation is constrained to the edges of the graph. In our case, the graph is 3-regular, and we need derangements (permutations with no fixed points) that are also automorphisms following the graph&#39;s edges.However, counting such derangements is non-trivial. Let&#39;s think about possible symmetries or decompositions.Alternatively, maybe the cube can be partitioned into pairs of vertices that are opposite in some way, and the permutations correspond to swapping these pairs.Wait, but each move is flipping two coordinates. Let&#39;s note that flipping two coordinates is equivalent to moving along a face diagonal. So, each such move is an involution if done twice? Wait, flipping two coordinates twice brings you back to the original position. So, each move is an involution. Therefore, a permutation consisting of such moves would be composed of transpositions (swaps) and cycles of even length?Wait, but in order to have a derangement, there can&#39;t be any fixed points, so all cycles must be of length at least 2. However, since each move is a transposition (swap), but how can you compose transpositions to form a permutation? Wait, actually, if you swap two vertices, then each swap is a transposition, but the problem is that each fly must move to another vertex via one of these transpositions. But if we do a single transposition, that would mean two flies swap places, but the rest must also move. However, the rest can&#39;t stay in place, so each fly must be part of a transposition or a longer cycle.But in our case, since each move is a transposition (if you move along a face diagonal, then moving back would be the reverse transposition). Wait, no, because moving from A to B is a transposition, but moving from B to A is the same transposition. So, if we have a permutation where each element is either fixed or swapped with another, but since we can&#39;t have fixed points, the permutation must consist entirely of disjoint transpositions. However, transpositions are swaps of two elements. But since we have 8 flies, which is an even number, the permutation can be decomposed into four transpositions. However, the problem is that each transposition must correspond to a valid move along a face diagonal.But wait, in the cube, not all transpositions are allowed. Only those that correspond to moving along a face diagonal. So, two vertices can be swapped only if they are diagonally opposite on a face.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of perfect matchings in the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph, where each edge is a face diagonal, and a perfect matching is a set of disjoint edges covering all vertices. Each perfect matching corresponds to a set of swaps (transpositions), and since there are no fixed points, this would be a derangement. However, each perfect matching is a derangement consisting of four transpositions. But the question is about the number of ways the flies can change position, which would correspond to the number of such perfect matchings.Wait, but the problem says &quot;in how many ways can the flies change position&quot;. If each fly independently chooses one of three possible moves, but we require that the overall permutation is a derangement (no two flies land on the same vertex). However, this is different from a perfect matching. A perfect matching is a specific type of permutation where the permutation is composed of disjoint transpositions (swaps). However, the problem allows for any permutation (could be cycles of any length) as long as each move is along a face diagonal and there are no fixed points. So, it&#39;s not limited to just swaps; a fly could move from A to B, then B to C, etc., forming a cycle, as long as each step is a valid face diagonal move.But in this case, since all the moves happen simultaneously, the permutation must decompose into cycles where each step in the cycle is a valid move. However, when considering simultaneous movement, cycles of length greater than 2 are possible only if the movement can be consistent in one step. For example, a 3-cycle would require that each element moves to the next position in the cycle, but since all moves are simultaneous, such cycles would require that each movement is along a face diagonal. However, in the cube, it&#39;s unclear if such cycles exist.Alternatively, perhaps the only possible derangements are products of disjoint transpositions. Because moving from A to B and B to A would be a swap, but moving from A to B, B to C, and C to A would require that each step is a valid move. However, in the cube, does such a 3-cycle exist where each consecutive move is along a face diagonal?Let me check with coordinates. Suppose we have a vertex (0,0,0). It can go to (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1). Let&#39;s say it goes to (1,1,0). Then, from (1,1,0), the possible moves are to (0,0,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1). If we go to (0,1,1), then from (0,1,1), the possible moves are (1,0,1), (0,0,0), or (1,1,0). Hmm, so in this case, starting at (0,0,0), moving to (1,1,0), then to (0,1,1), then to (1,0,1), and then from (1,0,1), you can go back to (0,0,0), (1,1,0), or (0,0,1). Wait, but (1,0,1) moving to (0,0,0) would be flipping x and z, which is a valid move. So, in this case, we have a cycle: (0,0,0) → (1,1,0) → (0,1,1) → (1,0,1) → (0,0,0). Wait, but that&#39;s a 4-cycle. Each step is a valid face diagonal move. So, cycles longer than 2 are possible.Therefore, the permutation can consist of cycles of various lengths, as long as each adjacent pair in the cycle is connected by a face diagonal. Therefore, the problem isn&#39;t limited to just swaps; there can be longer cycles. Therefore, the total number of derangements is the number of permutation of the 8 vertices, composed of cycles of length ≥2, where each adjacent move in the cycle is a face diagonal move.This complicates things because now we have to consider all possible cycle structures compatible with the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph. However, enumerating all such permutations is non-trivial.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the cube&#39;s vertices as a graph and find the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) that are automorphisms of the graph. But the cube&#39;s automorphism group is larger than our allowed moves. The automorphism group includes rotations and reflections, which might not correspond to moving along face diagonals.Alternatively, think about the graph where each vertex is connected to the three others via face diagonals. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of derangements (permutations without fixed points) on this graph, i.e., the number of permutations where each element is mapped to one of its neighbors, and no two elements map to the same.This is equivalent to counting the number of perfect matchings if we were only considering swaps, but since longer cycles are allowed, it&#39;s a more general problem. However, counting such permutations is difficult in general. Maybe there&#39;s a known result for this specific graph.Alternatively, note that the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph is actually the same as the cube&#39;s edges for the 3-dimensional hypercube, but wait, no. Wait, in a 3-dimensional hypercube (which is a cube), edges connect vertices that differ in one coordinate. However, in our case, the edges connect vertices that differ in two coordinates (since moving along a face diagonal flips two coordinates). So, our graph is different from the hypercube graph.Alternatively, our graph is the complement of the hypercube graph? Wait, in the hypercube graph, each vertex is connected to three others (differing in one coordinate). The complement would connect each vertex to the others that are not adjacent in the hypercube. However, in our case, the connections are to vertices differing in two coordinates, so it&#39;s neither the hypercube nor its complement. Wait, the complement of the hypercube graph would include edges for vertices differing in two or three coordinates. But our graph has edges only for those differing in two coordinates. So, perhaps it&#39;s a different graph.Alternatively, this graph is known as the &quot;square graph&quot; of the cube? Not sure. Maybe it&#39;s the graph formed by the face diagonals. Let&#39;s see, in the cube, each face has two diagonals, but each diagonal is an edge in our graph. So, each face contributes two edges to the graph. However, there are 6 faces, each contributing two diagonals, but each diagonal is shared by two faces? Wait, no. Each diagonal is unique to a face. Wait, no. For example, the diagonal from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0) is part of the front face (z=0). Similarly, the diagonal from (0,0,0) to (1,0,1) is part of the left face (y=0). Each diagonal is part of exactly one face. Therefore, the total number of edges in our graph is 6 faces * 2 diagonals per face = 12 edges. However, each vertex is part of three faces, each contributing one diagonal, so each vertex has three edges. Therefore, the graph has 8 vertices, 12 edges, each vertex has degree 3. So, it&#39;s a 3-regular graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges. Is this a known graph? Yes, this is the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph, also known as the cuboctahedron graph? Wait, no, the cuboctahedron is a different polyhedron. Wait, maybe it&#39;s the graph of the cube&#39;s space diagonals, but no, space diagonals connect opposite vertices through the cube, but here we are dealing with face diagonals.Alternatively, this graph is the same as the 3-regular graph formed by the cube&#39;s face diagonals. Let&#39;s check the properties. 8 vertices, 12 edges, 3-regular. The cube&#39;s edges are 12, but that&#39;s a different graph. The graph we are considering has edges as face diagonals. Let&#39;s see, in graph theory, the cube has another representation called the &quot;square prism&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, this graph is the same as the Wagner graph, which is an 8-vertex 3-regular graph with 12 edges. The Wagner graph is non-planar and is one of the minimal non-planar graphs. Let me check: the Wagner graph has 8 vertices and 12 edges, is 3-regular, and is indeed non-planar. So, perhaps our graph is the Wagner graph.If that&#39;s the case, then maybe the number of derangements (permutation with no fixed points, each element moving to a neighbor) is known for the Wagner graph. However, I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, let&#39;s try to compute it ourselves.First, note that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of derangements on the Wagner graph (if it is indeed the Wagner graph). This is equivalent to the number of perfect matchings in the graph if we restrict to swaps, but since the graph allows for longer cycles, it&#39;s more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of derangements. However, with 8 elements, this might get complicated. Alternatively, we can model this as a permutation matrix where each permutation corresponds to a derangement on the graph, and use matrix methods or recursion.Alternatively, notice that the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph can be partitioned into two sets of vertices, such that all edges go between the sets. That is, it might be a bipartite graph. Let&#39;s check.In the cube, if we color the vertices in black and white alternately, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. In the cube, which is a bipartite graph, this is possible. However, in our face diagonals graph, each edge connects two vertices that are two edges apart on the cube. Let&#39;s see, starting from a black vertex, moving along a face diagonal would lead to another vertex. Let&#39;s take (0,0,0) which is black. Moving along a face diagonal to (1,1,0), which would be white, since in the cube, adjacent vertices are different colors. Wait, (0,0,0) is black, (1,0,0) is white, (0,1,0) is white, (0,0,1) is white. Then, (1,1,0) is black, since it&#39;s two edges away from (0,0,0). Similarly, (1,0,1) is black, and (0,1,1) is black. So, moving along a face diagonal from a black vertex leads to a white vertex, and vice versa. Wait, but (1,1,0) is black, so moving from a black vertex to a white vertex? Wait, (0,0,0) is black, (1,1,0) is black. Wait, no. Wait, in the cube&#39;s bipartition, two vertices are in the same set if their coordinates sum to an even number. So, (0,0,0) has sum 0, even. (1,1,0) has sum 2, even. Similarly, (1,0,1) has sum 2, even. (0,1,1) has sum 2, even. So, all the vertices reachable by face diagonals from (0,0,0) are in the same set. Therefore, the face diagonals graph is not bipartite, because edges connect vertices within the same partition. Therefore, the graph is not bipartite. Therefore, the derangements can have cycles of odd length.This complicates things further.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the structure of the graph. Since each vertex is connected to three others, perhaps we can find its automorphism group and use Burnside&#39;s lemma or something similar. But that might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, note that each vertex has three possible moves, so the total number of possible mappings is 3^8, but we need to subtract those mappings where two or more flies land on the same vertex. However, inclusion-exclusion for derangements with restricted positions is complex here. The problem is similar to counting derangements with a restricted set of allowed permutations.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a derangement problem on a graph with specific adjacency, and use the matrix tree theorem or something else. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. The graph in question (face diagonals of cube) is a 3-regular graph with 8 vertices. Let&#39;s see if it&#39;s connected. Yes, you can get from any vertex to any other vertex via face diagonals. For example, from (0,0,0), you can go to (1,1,0), then from (1,1,0) you can go to (0,1,1), then to (1,0,1), etc. So, it&#39;s connected. Therefore, the graph is connected and 3-regular.In such graphs, the number of derangements (permutation with no fixed points, moving along edges) is difficult, but maybe we can use the concept of derangement polynomials or the like.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of linear algebra over the field of two elements, but not sure.Alternatively, note that each move corresponds to flipping two coordinates. So, each fly&#39;s movement can be represented as a vector in GF(2)^3, since the coordinates are binary. Flipping two coordinates is equivalent to adding a vector with two 1s. So, for example, moving from (0,0,0) to (1,1,0) is adding (1,1,0). Similarly, moving to (1,0,1) is adding (1,0,1), and moving to (0,1,1) is adding (0,1,1). Therefore, the set of possible moves for each fly corresponds to adding one of three vectors: (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1).Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to assign to each vertex v a vector from the set S = {(1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)} such that the sum (in GF(2)) for each coordinate is a permutation of the vertices, i.e., each vertex is targeted exactly once.Wait, but in GF(2), addition is modulo 2. However, if we consider the movement as permutation, we need the mapping to be bijective. So, if we think of each fly&#39;s movement as adding a vector from S to its current position, then the entire movement is a permutation if and only if the mapping is bijective.However, since we are working over GF(2)^3, the set of all possible assignments corresponds to functions from GF(2)^3 to S. However, bijectivity is a strong condition here.Alternatively, perhaps this perspective can help. Let me consider that each movement corresponds to a translation by a vector in S. However, translations in GF(2)^3 are additions, but since we need the overall mapping to be a permutation, the vectors assigned must form a so-called &quot;orthomorphism&quot;. An orthomorphism is a permutation where the difference function is also a permutation. But I&#39;m not sure if this applies here.Alternatively, note that the set S consists of three vectors: (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). These vectors are linearly dependent in GF(2)^3, since their sum is (0,0,0). Therefore, the set S does not form a basis. Therefore, the possible assignments are constrained by linear dependencies.This might not directly help, but let&#39;s consider that for the movement to be a permutation, each target vertex must be reached exactly once. Therefore, the mapping from original vertices to target vertices must be bijective. Each original vertex v is mapped to v + s_v, where s_v ∈ S. So, we need that for all v, w: v + s_v ≠ w + s_w unless v = w.This is equivalent to saying that s_v - s_w ≠ v - w for all v ≠ w. But since we are in GF(2), subtraction is the same as addition. Therefore, s_v + s_w ≠ v + w for all v ≠ w. However, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the cube&#39;s vertices can be partitioned into two tetrahedrons. Each tetrahedron consists of four vertices no two of which are adjacent in the cube. However, in our face diagonals graph, the edges connect vertices within the same tetrahedron? Let me check.Take the two tetrahedrons in the cube: one with vertices (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) and the other with (1,1,1), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0). In the face diagonals graph, each edge connects two vertices within the same tetrahedron. For example, (0,0,0) is connected to (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), all of which are in the same tetrahedron. Similarly, (1,1,1) is connected to (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), all in the other tetrahedron. Therefore, the face diagonals graph is composed of two disconnected 4-vertex graphs, each being a complete graph K4. Wait, because in each tetrahedron, every pair of vertices is connected by a face diagonal?Wait, no. In the tetrahedron (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), each pair of vertices is connected by a face diagonal?Wait, let&#39;s check the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,1,0): that&#39;s a face diagonal, distance 2. Between (0,0,0) and (1,0,1): also a face diagonal, distance 2. Between (0,0,0) and (0,1,1): face diagonal, distance 2. Between (1,1,0) and (1,0,1): that&#39;s an edge in the cube? Wait, (1,1,0) and (1,0,1) differ by two coordinates (y and z), so that&#39;s a face diagonal as well. Wait, in the cube, moving from (1,1,0) to (1,0,1) is a move along the face that is the right face (x=1). The face x=1 has vertices (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (1,0,1). The diagonals here are (1,0,0)-(1,1,1) and (1,1,0)-(1,0,1). Therefore, (1,1,0) to (1,0,1) is a face diagonal. Similarly, all pairs in the tetrahedron are connected by face diagonals. Therefore, each tetrahedron is a complete graph K4 in the face diagonals graph. Similarly for the other tetrahedron.Therefore, the face diagonals graph of the cube is two disjoint copies of K4. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, each tetrahedron has four vertices, each connected to the other three via edges (face diagonals). So, each tetrahedron is a K4. And since the two tetrahedrons are separate (no edges between them in the face diagonals graph), the entire graph is two disjoint K4s.But wait, this can&#39;t be right because in the cube, a face diagonal connects two vertices in the same tetrahedron. But when you consider all face diagonals, the two tetrahedrons are indeed each a K4, and there are no edges between the two tetrahedrons. Therefore, the face diagonals graph is two disjoint K4s.Wait, let&#39;s verify with coordinates. Take the first tetrahedron: (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). The other tetrahedron is (1,1,1), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0). Each vertex in the first tetrahedron is connected to the other three in the same tetrahedron via face diagonals, and similarly for the second. There are no face diagonals connecting the two tetrahedrons. Because a face diagonal on the cube connects two vertices in the same face, and each face is entirely within one tetrahedron? No, wait, each face of the cube has two tetrahedrons. For example, the front face (z=0) has vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0). In our tetrahedron split, (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) are in the first tetrahedron, while (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) are in the second. Therefore, the front face&#39;s diagonals are (0,0,0)-(1,1,0) and (1,0,0)-(0,1,0), each within their respective tetrahedrons. Therefore, yes, each face diagonal is within a tetrahedron, so the face diagonals graph is two disjoint K4s.Therefore, the problem reduces to two separate problems on each K4. Since the two tetrahedrons are independent, the number of derangements for the entire cube is the product of the number of derangements for each K4.Therefore, we can compute the number of derangements on a K4 graph and then square it (since there are two K4s), but actually, since the entire permutation must be a derangement on the whole cube, which is composed of two separate K4s, the total number of derangements would be the product of the derangements on each K4. However, we need to ensure that on each K4, the permutation is a derangement (no fixed points) with moves along edges (which, in K4, every pair is connected, so any permutation is allowed as long as it&#39;s a derangement). Wait, but in a K4, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, any derangement is possible, as there are no restrictions except no fixed points.But wait, in a K4, the edges represent allowed moves. So, in the K4, each vertex can move to any other vertex, since it&#39;s a complete graph. Therefore, the number of derangements on a K4 is the number of derangements of 4 elements, which is 9. But wait, derangements of 4 elements are 9. However, since the graph allows any permutation (as all edges are present), the number of derangements would be the same as the regular derangements. However, in our case, the graph is two separate K4s, so the total number of derangements would be 9 * 9 = 81. However, this contradicts our initial problem statement where each fly has only three possible moves. Wait, this can&#39;t be right.Wait, here&#39;s the confusion: If the face diagonals graph is two separate K4s, then within each K4, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, so each fly in a K4 can move to any of the three other vertices in its tetrahedron. However, the regular derangement count for 4 elements is 9, but each derangement corresponds to a permutation where each element moves to a different position, but in our case, each move must be along an edge (i.e., to a vertex in the same tetrahedron). But since in the K4, every pair is connected, any derangement is allowed. However, in reality, a derangement of 4 elements can be any permutation without fixed points, which includes cycles of length 2 and 4. However, in our problem, each fly must move to a vertex in the same K4 (tetrahedron), but the movement is not restricted further. Therefore, the number of derangements within each K4 is indeed the number of derangements of 4 elements, which is 9. Therefore, the total number of derangements for the entire cube is 9 * 9 = 81.But wait, let&#39;s verify this. For a single K4, the number of derangements is 9. Let&#39;s recall that derangements of n elements are calculated as !n = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - ... + (-1)^n /n!). For n=4, !4 = 24*(1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24) = 24*(0 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417) = 24*(0.375) = 9. So yes, !4=9. Therefore, each K4 has 9 derangements, so two K4s would have 9*9=81 derangements.However, this contradicts the initial thought that each fly has three choices. If each fly has three choices, the total number of possible moves would be 3^8, but with derangements, it&#39;s much lower. But if the graph is two K4s, then for each K4, the number of derangements is 9, leading to 81 total.But wait, the problem says &quot;each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite to it.&quot; So, if the graph is two K4s, each K4 corresponds to a tetrahedron, which is not a face. Faces are squares. So, there&#39;s a contradiction here. Earlier, we thought that the face diagonals graph splits the cube into two tetrahedrons, each a K4. But tetrahedrons are not faces of the cube. Therefore, maybe this approach is incorrect.Wait, let&#39;s go back. The cube has six faces, each face has two diagonals. Each diagonal connects two vertices. The face diagonals graph is formed by all these diagonals. But each diagonal is entirely within a face, which is a square. However, when we take all face diagonals, they form two tetrahedrons? Let me think.Take the front face (z=0). Its diagonals are (0,0,0)-(1,1,0) and (1,0,0)-(0,1,0). Similarly, the back face (z=1) has diagonals (0,0,1)-(1,1,1) and (1,0,1)-(0,1,1). The top face (y=1) has diagonals (0,1,0)-(1,1,1) and (1,1,0)-(0,1,1). The bottom face (y=0) has diagonals (0,0,0)-(1,0,1) and (1,0,0)-(0,0,1). The left face (x=0) has diagonals (0,0,0)-(0,1,1) and (0,1,0)-(0,0,1). The right face (x=1) has diagonals (1,0,0)-(1,1,1) and (1,1,0)-(1,0,1).Now, connecting all these diagonals, we can see that vertices are connected across different faces. For example, (0,0,0) is connected via front face diagonal to (1,1,0), via left face diagonal to (0,1,1), and via bottom face diagonal to (1,0,1). Similarly, (1,1,0) is connected to (0,0,0), (1,0,1), and (0,1,1). So, indeed, the four vertices (0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) form a complete graph K4, each connected to the others via face diagonals. Similarly, the other four vertices (1,1,1), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0) form another K4. Therefore, the face diagonals graph is indeed two disjoint K4s.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding derangements within each K4, since there are no edges between the two K4s. Therefore, the total number of derangements is the product of the derangements in each K4. As each K4 has 9 derangements, the total is 9*9=81. Therefore, the answer is 81.However, the problem states &quot;in how many ways can the flies change position so that there is no vertex with 2 or more flies.&quot; If the cube&#39;s face diagonals graph is two disjoint K4s, then yes, the derangements are 9 per K4, leading to 81. But I want to verify this with an example.Let me take a smaller case. Consider one K4 with four flies. The number of derangements is 9. Let&#39;s list them. The derangements of four elements are all permutations with no fixed points. They consist of the derangements which are either a single 4-cycle or two 2-cycles. For four elements, the number of derangements is 9. Let&#39;s confirm:- The number of 4-cycles: (4-1)! = 6- The number of derangements with two 2-cycles: 3Total: 6 + 3 = 9.So, in each K4, there are 9 derangements. Therefore, for two K4s, 9*9=81. Therefore, the answer should be 81.But let&#39;s think again: when we split the cube into two tetrahedrons, each fly in a tetrahedron must stay within that tetrahedron when moving, because there are no edges between the two K4s. Therefore, the movement is confined within each tetrahedron, so the total number of derangements is indeed 81. However, is this correct?Wait, but in the cube, a fly can move along a face diagonal, which is within a face. But each face is part of both tetrahedrons. For example, the front face has two vertices in each tetrahedron. Wait, no. Earlier, we saw that the front face (z=0) has vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0). In our tetrahedron split, (0,0,0) and (1,1,0) are in the first tetrahedron, while (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) are in the second. Therefore, the front face diagonals connect (0,0,0)-(1,1,0) in the first tetrahedron and (1,0,0)-(0,1,0) in the second. Therefore, each face diagonal is entirely within a tetrahedron. Therefore, when a fly moves along a face diagonal, it stays within its tetrahedron. Therefore, the two tetrahedrons are indeed separate, and movements don&#39;t cross between them.Therefore, the total number of derangements is 9*9=81. Therefore, the answer should be 81.But wait, according to the problem statement, each fly is on a vertex of the cube. When the whistle blows, each fly moves to a vertex in the same face as the previous one but diagonally opposite. So, each fly must move along a face diagonal of the face it was on. However, each fly is on three faces. Therefore, each fly has three choices. However, in our analysis, the movement is constrained within the tetrahedron (K4). Therefore, the possible movements are limited to the three other vertices in the same tetrahedron, which correspond to the three face diagonals of the three faces the fly is on.Therefore, the initial problem is indeed equivalent to derangements within two separate K4s, giving 9*9=81. Therefore, the answer is 81.However, I need to verify this with an example.Take a simple case: the first tetrahedron has vertices A, B, C, D. The number of derangements is 9. Each derangement is a permutation where no fly stays in place. For example, one derangement is swapping A-B and C-D. Another is swapping A-C and B-D. Another is swapping A-D and B-C. These are the three derangements with two 2-cycles. Then, there are six derangements that are 4-cycles. So, each K4 has 9 derangements. Therefore, two K4s lead to 81 derangements. Therefore, the answer is 81.Therefore, I think the correct answer is boxed{81}.Final Answerboxed{81}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves a cube with a fly on each vertex. When a whistle blows, each fly moves to a vertex diagonally opposite on the same face. We need to determine the number of ways the flies can move such that no vertex has more than one fly.1. Understanding the Cube Structure:   - A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces.   - Each vertex is part of three faces.   - Each fly can move to one of three vertices diagonally opposite on the three faces it belongs to.2. Graph Representation:   - The cube&#39;s vertices can be represented as binary triplets (x, y, z) where x, y, z ∈ {0, 1}.   - Moving along a face diagonal flips two coordinates, leading to vertices in the same tetrahedron.3. Tetrahedron Split:   - The cube&#39;s vertices can be split into two tetrahedrons, each forming a complete graph (K4).   - Each tetrahedron contains four vertices, and each vertex is connected to the other three via face diagonals.4. Derangements in K4:   - A derangement is a permutation with no fixed points.   - For a K4 graph (4 vertices), the number of derangements is 9. This includes permutations with two 2-cycles or a single 4-cycle.5. Total Derangements:   - Since the cube is split into two disjoint K4s, the total number of derangements is the product of derangements in each K4.   - Each K4 has 9 derangements, leading to a total of (9 times 9 = 81).Thus, the number of ways the flies can change position such that no vertex has two or more flies is (boxed{81}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🔑:</span>1. Separate the cube into two tetrahedra:   - A cube can be divided into two tetrahedra by considering the vertices of the cube. Each tetrahedron will have 4 vertices.   - Let&#39;s label the vertices of the cube as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ). One possible way to separate the cube into two tetrahedra is by considering vertices ( A, B, C, D ) for the first tetrahedron and ( E, F, G, H ) for the second tetrahedron.2. Determine the possible movements for the flies:   - Each fly moves to a vertex in the same face but diagonally opposite to it. This means each fly will move to a vertex that is not adjacent to its current position.   - For each tetrahedron, the flies can either form two cycles of length 2 or one cycle of length 4.3. Calculate the number of ways for 2 cycles of length 2:   - For each tetrahedron, we need to choose 2 pairs of vertices out of 4 vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 pairs is given by:     [     frac{binom{4}{2}}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3     ]   - This calculation accounts for the fact that the order of the pairs does not matter.4. Calculate the number of ways for 1 cycle of length 4:   - For a cycle of length 4, we need to consider the chirality (handedness) of the cycle. There are 2 possible cycles for each set of 4 vertices (one clockwise and one counterclockwise).   - The number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 edges that will not be traversed (and are opposite each other) is:     [     frac{binom{4}{2}}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3     ]   - We multiply this by 2 to account for the chirality:     [     3 times 2 = 6     ]5. Combine the results for both tetrahedra:   - For each tetrahedron, we have 3 ways for 2 cycles of length 2 and 6 ways for 1 cycle of length 4.   - Therefore, the total number of ways for each tetrahedron is:     [     3 + 6 = 9     ]   - Since there are two tetrahedra, the total number of ways for the flies to change position is:     [     9 times 9 = 81     ]Conclusion:[boxed{81}]</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-1fc33dbb data-v-db1da8c8><div class="review" data-v-db1da8c8><div class="review-title" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>❓:</span>Determine all positive integers n with the property that the third root of n is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits.</div><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is to determine all positive integers n such that the cube root of n is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits. Hmm. So, if I have a number n, and if I take its cube root, that should be equal to the number you get when you remove the last three digits of n. Let me try to translate that into an equation. Let&#39;s say that the cube root of n is some integer k. So, n = k^3. Then, removing the last three digits of n should give us k. Wait, how do you remove the last three digits of a number? Removing the last three digits is the same as dividing by 1000 and taking the integer part, right? So, if n is a number, then removing the last three digits would give us floor(n / 1000). But in this problem, they probably want that removing the last three digits exactly gives k, not just the floor. So, maybe n is a number such that when you divide it by 1000, you get k, which is an integer. So, n = k * 1000 + something, but the something has to be the last three digits. However, since n is equal to k^3, maybe we can write that k^3 = 1000k + m, where m is some number less than 1000? Because if you remove the last three digits, which is equivalent to m, then the remaining part is k. So, k^3 must be equal to 1000k + m, where m is between 0 and 999. Wait, but m is the last three digits, so it&#39;s the remainder when n is divided by 1000. Therefore, m = n mod 1000. So, the equation would be:k^3 = 1000k + m, where 0 ≤ m &lt; 1000.But since n = k^3, and n is a positive integer, k must also be a positive integer. So, our equation is k^3 = 1000k + m, with m being the last three digits of k^3, which is the same as m = k^3 mod 1000. Wait, but substituting that back into the equation would give k^3 = 1000k + (k^3 mod 1000). Hmm, that might be a bit circular. Let&#39;s see if we can rephrase this.Alternatively, if we remove the last three digits of n, which is k^3, we get k. So, n is k^3, and when we divide k^3 by 1000, we get k. That is, k = floor(k^3 / 1000). But actually, since removing the last three digits is equivalent to integer division by 1000, it&#39;s not just the floor, but exactly k. So, k^3 must be equal to 1000k + m, where m is a three-digit number (including leading zeros) such that 0 ≤ m &lt; 1000. Therefore, we can write:k^3 - 1000k = mSince m must be less than 1000, we have:k^3 - 1000k &lt; 1000So,k^3 - 1000k - 1000 &lt; 0Hmm, solving this inequality for k. Let&#39;s try to find the possible integer values of k.Alternatively, rearranging:k^3 - 1000k = m &lt; 1000So,k^3 - 1000k &lt; 1000Let&#39;s factor the left side:k(k^2 - 1000) &lt; 1000So, k times (k^2 - 1000) is less than 1000. Let&#39;s analyze this.First, note that k must be a positive integer. Let&#39;s consider possible values of k.If k is too small, say k=1, then k(k^2 - 1000) = 1*(1 - 1000) = -999, which is less than 1000. But m has to be non-negative, right? Because m is the last three digits. So m must be between 0 and 999. Therefore, k(k^2 - 1000) must be non-negative? Because m = k^3 - 1000k must be non-negative. Wait, m can be 0, so m &gt;= 0. Therefore, k^3 - 1000k &gt;= 0Therefore, k^3 &gt;= 1000kDividing both sides by k (since k is positive), we get:k^2 &gt;= 1000Therefore, k &gt;= sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62. So, k must be at least 32.But also, from the earlier inequality, k(k^2 - 1000) &lt; 1000So, k^3 - 1000k &lt; 1000So, k^3 - 1000k - 1000 &lt; 0We need to find integers k &gt;= 32 such that k^3 - 1000k - 1000 &lt; 0.Wait, but when k is 32, let&#39;s compute k^3 - 1000k:32^3 = 32768, 1000*32 = 32000, so 32768 - 32000 = 768. Then, 768 - 1000 = -232 &lt; 0. So, k=32: 32^3 - 1000*32 - 1000 = -232 &lt; 0.But m = k^3 - 1000k must be between 0 and 999. Wait, hold on: if k^3 - 1000k = m &gt;=0, then we have k^3 - 1000k &gt;=0, which we already determined k &gt;=32. But for k=32, k^3 -1000k =768, which is m=768. So, 768 is between 0 and 999, so that&#39;s valid.But the problem is that if k=32, then n = k^3 = 32768. If we remove the last three digits of 32768, we get 32.768 -&gt; 32, which is equal to k. So that works? Wait, 32768 is a 5-digit number. The last three digits are 768. Removing them gives 32, which is k. So yes, 32^3 is 32768, removing the last three digits gives 32, which is k. So that works.Wait, but hold on, when k=32, m=768, which is the last three digits. So n=32768, which is 32 followed by 768. So that works. So 32 is a solution.Similarly, let&#39;s check k=31. Wait, but k must be at least 32, because k^2 &gt;=1000. So k=31: 31^2=961 &lt;1000, so k=31 is invalid.Now, let&#39;s check higher values of k. Let&#39;s try k=33. 33^3=35937, 35937 - 1000*33 =35937-33000=2937. But 2937 is greater than 1000, which would imply m=2937, but m must be less than 1000. Therefore, this is invalid. Therefore, k=33 is invalid.Wait, so k=33 gives m=2937, which is too big. So, m must be less than 1000. Therefore, k^3 -1000k &lt;1000, which for k=33, 35937 - 33000=2937&gt;1000. So, no good.Similarly, k=34: 34^3=39304, 39304 -34000=5304&gt;1000. So, invalid.So, seems like k=32 is a candidate.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s another k where k^3 -1000k is between 0 and 999? Let&#39;s check k=10: 1000-10000=-9000, which is negative, invalid. k=32 is 32768-32000=768. k=33 is 35937-33000=2937&gt;1000. So, as k increases beyond 32, k^3 -1000k increases rapidly. So, perhaps only k=32 is valid?Wait, but let&#39;s check for k=0: 0-0=0, but n=0 is not positive. So, k=32 is the only one?But wait, let me check k=32 again. n=32^3=32768. Removing the last three digits gives 32, which is k. So yes, that&#39;s correct.Is there another possible k where k^3 -1000k is between 0 and 999?Wait, perhaps k=100: 100^3=1,000,000. 1,000,000 -1000*100=1,000,000-100,000=900,000. Which is way higher than 1000. So, invalid.Wait, but maybe k is a four-digit number? Wait, if k is a four-digit number, say k=1000, then k^3 is 1,000,000,000. Removing the last three digits would give 1,000,000, which is 1000. But k=1000, so that would work? Wait, n=1000^3=1,000,000,000. Removing the last three digits (which are 000) gives 1,000,000. But 1,000,000 is not equal to k=1000. So, that doesn&#39;t work.Wait, so even if k is four digits, removing the last three digits of n=k^3 would give a number much larger than k.Wait, but maybe k has more digits? Let&#39;s suppose k is a two-digit number. Wait, k=32 is two-digit. If k is three-digit, say k=100, then k^3=1,000,000, removing last three digits gives 1,000. But 1,000 ≠100. So, no. Similarly, k=123, k^3=1860867, removing last three digits gives 1860, which is not 123.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a k where k^3 has exactly three more digits than k. For example, k=32 is two-digit, k^3=32768 is five-digit. So, removing the last three digits would leave 32, which is two-digit. So that works. If k is three-digit, then k^3 would be up to nine digits (if k=999, k^3=997002999). So, removing the last three digits would leave a six-digit number, which is not equal to k. So, no. If k is one-digit, then k^3 is at most 729 (9^3), which is three digits. Removing the last three digits would leave 0, which is not equal to k. So, only when k is two-digit, and k^3 is five-digit. Wait, 10^3=1000, which is four digits. Removing the last three digits gives 1, which is 10/10, but not 10. So, no. 32^3=32768. Five digits. Removing last three digits gives 32. Which is k. So that works. 33^3=35937. Five digits. Removing last three digits gives 35 (from 35937, removing 937 gives 35). But 35≠33. So, no. So, 32 is the only two-digit number where k^3 is a five-digit number, and removing the last three digits gives k.But wait, let&#39;s check k=00. But n must be positive. So, k=0 is invalid.Wait, but let&#39;s check k=31. 31^3=29791. Removing the last three digits gives 29 (since 29791 becomes 29.791). But k=31≠29. So, invalid.k=30: 27000. Remove last three digits: 27. k=30≠27.k=10: 1000. Remove last three digits: 1. 10≠1.So, 32 seems unique.Wait, but let&#39;s check if there are any higher k where k^3 -1000k is between 0 and 999. Let&#39;s try k=32: 32768 -32000=768, which is between 0 and 999. k=33: 35937 -33000=2937&gt;999. So, no. k=34: 39304 -34000=5304&gt;999. So, k=32 is the only one.Wait, but let&#39;s check k=1: 1 -1000= -999, which is less than 0, so invalid. So, only k=32.Therefore, the only positive integer n is 32768, which is 32^3, and removing the last three digits (768) gives 32.But let me verify once again. Let&#39;s compute 32^3: 32*32=1024, 1024*32=32768. Yes. Removing the last three digits: 32768 → 32 (since 768 are the last three digits). So, 32 is indeed the cube root. Therefore, n=32768 is the solution.But the problem says &quot;determine all positive integers n&quot;. So, is 32768 the only one?Let me check if there could be others. Suppose there&#39;s a k such that k^3 = 1000k + m, where m is between 0 and 999. So, k^3 -1000k must be in [0,999]. Let&#39;s analyze the function f(k)=k^3 -1000k. We can look for integer solutions where f(k) is in [0,999].We already found k=32, f(32)=768. Let&#39;s check k=31: f(31)=29791 -31000= -1209. Which is negative. k=32:768. k=33:35937 -33000=2937&gt;999. Therefore, only k=32 is in the valid range.Therefore, the only solution is n=32^3=32768.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a k where k^3 is a number with more digits, but when you remove the last three, you get k. For example, if k is three-digit, maybe k^3 is a six-digit number, so removing the last three digits gives a three-digit number, which could be k. Let&#39;s test that. Let k=100. k^3=1,000,000. Remove last three digits: 1000. 1000≠100. No. k=123: k^3=1860867. Remove last three digits:1860. 1860≠123. Similarly, k=999:997002999. Remove last three digits:997002. Which is not 999. So, no.If k is four-digit, k=1000:1,000,000,000. Remove last three digits:1,000,000. Not equal to 1000. So, no. So, seems like no other k beyond two-digit would work.But wait, let&#39;s check k=32. Is there a k=032? If k is three-digit, like 032, but that&#39;s just 32. Leading zeros aren&#39;t considered in integers. So, k must be a positive integer without leading zeros.Therefore, the only possible n is 32768. So, the answer is boxed{32768}Final Answerboxed{32768}&lt;/think&gt;To determine all positive integers ( n ) such that the cube root of ( n ) is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits, we start by letting ( k ) be the cube root of ( n ). This means ( n = k^3 ). Removing the last three digits of ( n ) should give ( k ), which implies that ( k ) must be the integer part of ( frac{n}{1000} ).We can express this relationship mathematically as:[k^3 = 1000k + m]where ( 0 leq m &lt; 1000 ). This equation can be rearranged to:[k^3 - 1000k = m]Since ( m ) must be a non-negative integer less than 1000, we have:[0 leq k^3 - 1000k &lt; 1000]We analyze the inequality ( k^3 - 1000k geq 0 ):[k^3 geq 1000k implies k^2 geq 1000 implies k geq sqrt{1000} approx 31.62]Thus, ( k ) must be at least 32. Checking ( k = 32 ):[32^3 = 32768 quad text{and} quad 32768 - 1000 times 32 = 32768 - 32000 = 768]Here, ( m = 768 ) is valid since it is between 0 and 999. Removing the last three digits of 32768 gives 32, which matches ( k ).Checking values of ( k ) greater than 32, such as 33:[33^3 = 35937 quad text{and} quad 35937 - 1000 times 33 = 35937 - 33000 = 2937]Here, ( m = 2937 ) is invalid as it exceeds 999. Similarly, larger values of ( k ) will result in ( m ) values greater than 999.Thus, the only valid solution is ( k = 32 ), leading to ( n = 32^3 = 32768 ).The final answer is:[boxed{32768}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking for all positive integers n such that the cube root of n is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits. Hmm. So, if I understand correctly, if we take n and remove its last three digits, we get the cube root of n. Let me try to formalize that.Let me denote the cube root of n as some number m. So, m³ = n. The problem states that if we remove the last three digits of n, we get m. Removing the last three digits of a number is equivalent to dividing by 1000 and taking the integer part, right? So, n divided by 1000, floored, equals m. But since n is m³, we can write m = floor(m³ / 1000). Wait, but actually, if removing the last three digits gives exactly m, then n must be exactly m followed by three zeros, right? Because removing the last three digits would give m, so n is m multiplied by 1000 plus some three digits. But if n is equal to m³, then m³ must be equal to 1000m plus some three-digit number. Wait, but the problem says removing the last three digits gives m, so n is m followed by three digits. But those three digits can be any digits, not necessarily zeros. Wait, no, if you remove the last three digits, it&#39;s like integer division by 1000. So, n = m * 1000 + k, where k is a number between 0 and 999 (inclusive). But also, n = m³. So, combining these two equations:m³ = 1000m + kwhere 0 ≤ k ≤ 999.But since k is non-negative, that means m³ ≥ 1000m. So, m³ - 1000m ≥ 0 ⇒ m(m² - 1000) ≥ 0. Since m is positive, this implies m² - 1000 ≥ 0 ⇒ m² ≥ 1000 ⇒ m ≥ √1000 ≈ 31.62. So m must be at least 32.Also, since k ≤ 999, we have m³ = 1000m + k ≤ 1000m + 999. Therefore, m³ - 1000m ≤ 999. Let&#39;s write this as m³ - 1000m ≤ 999. So, m³ - 1000m - 999 ≤ 0.We need to find integers m ≥ 32 such that m³ - 1000m - 999 ≤ 0. Let&#39;s see how big m can be.Let me try m = 32. Compute 32³ - 1000*32 - 999. 32³ is 32768. 1000*32 is 32000. So 32768 - 32000 = 768. Then 768 - 999 = -231. So that&#39;s negative. So m=32 satisfies the inequality.m=33: 33³ = 35937. 1000*33=33000. 35937 - 33000 = 2937. Then 2937 - 999 = 1938. Which is positive. So the inequality is not satisfied. Wait, but m=33 gives m³ - 1000m = 35937 - 33000 = 2937, and k = 2937. But k is supposed to be less than or equal to 999. So, that would mean k=2937, which is more than 999, so it&#39;s invalid. Hence m=33 is too big.Wait, but earlier, the inequality m³ - 1000m ≤ 999 was derived. So m=32 gives 32768 - 32000 = 768 ≤ 999, which works. m=33 gives 35937 - 33000 = 2937 &gt; 999, which doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, m must be between 32 and some upper limit. Wait, but actually, m=32 is the only one where m³ - 1000m is less than or equal to 999. Let&#39;s check m=31. Wait, m=31 was already below the lower bound. Because m must be at least 32. Wait, m=31: 31² = 961 &lt; 1000, so m=31 is too small. So possible m is 32.Wait, but wait, let me check m=32. Then n = 32³ = 32768. If we remove the last three digits of 32768, which are 768, we get 32. So yes, 32 is the cube root of 32768, and removing the last three digits gives 32. So that works. Then m=32 is a solution. Are there any other m?Wait, perhaps m=0? But n has to be positive. m=0 would lead to n=0, which is not positive. So no. Then m=32 is the only solution? Wait, but let me verify for m=10. Let&#39;s see, m=10: n=1000. Then removing the last three digits gives 1, but 1 is not 10. So that doesn&#39;t work. Wait, m=10 is too small. Similarly, m=32 is the first m where m³ is a four-digit number (32³ is 32768), so removing the last three digits gives 32. So that works.Wait, but let me check m=100. Then n=100³ = 1,000,000. Removing the last three digits would give 1000, which is not 100. So that&#39;s not a solution. Wait, but maybe m=1000? Then n=1000³=1,000,000,000. Removing the last three digits gives 1,000,000, which is 1000, so that works? Wait, n would be 1,000,000,000. The cube root is 1000. Removing the last three digits of 1,000,000,000 (which are 000) gives 1,000,000. Wait, that&#39;s not 1000. Wait, removing the last three digits of 1,000,000,000 would be 1,000,000, right? Which is 1,000,000 vs cube root 1000. So that doesn&#39;t work. So m=1000 is not a solution.Wait, maybe I need to check numbers where m³ is m followed by three digits. So, for example, 32³ = 32768, which is 32 followed by 768. So removing the last three digits gives 32, which is m. So that works. Similarly, if there is a larger m where m³ is m followed by three digits. For example, if m=100, then m³=1,000,000, which is 100 followed by 000, but removing the last three digits gives 1000, not 100. Wait, no. Wait, 1,000,000 is &quot;1000000&quot;. Removing the last three digits would be 1000, not 100. So that&#39;s not equal to m. So m=100 is not a solution. Similarly, m=999: m³ would be a large number, but removing the last three digits would give some number, but not 999.So maybe only m=32 works? Wait, let&#39;s check m=32. Then n=32³=32768. Removing the last three digits (768) gives 32. So that&#39;s correct. Let&#39;s check m=33. n=33³=35937. Removing the last three digits (937) gives 35, which is not 33. So that&#39;s not correct. m=34: 34³=39304. Removing the last three digits (304) gives 39, which is not 34. So nope. Similarly, m=31: 31³=29791. Removing the last three digits (791) gives 29, which is not 31. So m=32 is the only one? Hmm. Wait, let me check m=99: 99³=970299. Removing the last three digits (299) gives 970, which is not 99. Nope. How about m=10: 1000. Removing three digits (000) gives 1, which is not 10. So m=32 is the only one? Let me check m=5: 125. Remove three digits, but 125 is only three digits. Removing three digits would leave nothing. So nope. So maybe 32 is the only solution.Wait, but why? Let me formalize this. Suppose that n is a number such that n = m³, and when we remove the last three digits of n, we get m. Removing the last three digits is equivalent to dividing by 1000 and taking the floor. So, m = floor(n / 1000). But since n = m³, that implies m = floor(m³ / 1000). So, m³ must be between 1000m and 1000(m + 1). So, 1000m ≤ m³ &lt; 1000(m + 1). Therefore, 1000 ≤ m² &lt; 1000(m + 1)/m. Wait, let&#39;s divide all parts by m (assuming m &gt; 0):1000 ≤ m² &lt; 1000(m + 1)/m.Simplify the right-hand side: 1000(m + 1)/m = 1000(1 + 1/m). So, 1000 ≤ m² &lt; 1000(1 + 1/m).So, m² must be at least 1000, so m ≥ √1000 ≈ 31.62, so m ≥ 32, as before.And m² &lt; 1000(1 + 1/m). Let&#39;s see. For m=32:Left side: 32²=1024.Right side: 1000*(1 + 1/32) = 1000*(33/32) = 1000*1.03125=1031.25.So, 1024 &lt; 1031.25. So, 32 satisfies the inequality.For m=33:Left side: 33²=1089.Right side: 1000*(1 + 1/33) ≈ 1000*1.0303≈1030.3.But 1089 is not less than 1030.3. So, m=33 does not satisfy the inequality. Similarly, for larger m, m² will be even larger, so the inequality m² &lt; 1000(1 + 1/m) will not hold.Therefore, only m=32 satisfies both inequalities. Therefore, the only solution is n=32³=32768.Wait, but let&#39;s check m=32. The cube is 32768. Removing the last three digits (768) leaves 32, which is m. So that works. So, n=32768 is the only number with this property.Hence, the answer is boxed{32768}.Final Answerboxed{32768}&lt;/think&gt;Given a positive integer ( n ), we need to determine ( n ) such that the cube root of ( n ) is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits. Let ( m ) be the cube root of ( n ), so ( n = m^3 ). Removing the last three digits of ( n ) gives ( m ), which implies ( n ) can be written as ( 1000m + k ) where ( 0 leq k &lt; 1000 ). Therefore, we have:[m^3 = 1000m + k]Since ( 0 leq k &lt; 1000 ), it follows that:[1000m leq m^3 &lt; 1000(m + 1)]Dividing by ( m ) (assuming ( m &gt; 0 )):[1000 leq m^2 &lt; 1000 left(1 + frac{1}{m}right)]The left inequality ( 1000 leq m^2 ) implies ( m geq sqrt{1000} approx 31.62 ), so ( m geq 32 ). The right inequality ( m^2 &lt; 1000 left(1 + frac{1}{m}right) ) needs to be checked for ( m = 32 ):For ( m = 32 ):- ( m^2 = 1024 )- Right-hand side: ( 1000 left(1 + frac{1}{32}right) = 1031.25 )Since ( 1024 &lt; 1031.25 ), ( m = 32 ) satisfies the inequality. Checking ( m = 33 ) and larger values shows they do not satisfy the right inequality.Thus, the only solution is ( m = 32 ), leading to ( n = 32^3 = 32768 ). Removing the last three digits of ( 32768 ) gives ( 32 ), confirming the solution.The final answer is (boxed{32768}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking for all positive integers n such that the cube root of n is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits. Hmm. So, if I understand correctly, if we take n and chop off its last three digits, we get the cube root of n. Let me try to parse this.Let me rephrase the problem in mathematical terms. Suppose n is a positive integer. Let k be the cube root of n. Then, according to the problem, k is equal to n with its last three digits removed. So, n is a number that when you remove its last three digits, you get its cube root. So, n is a four-digit number or more? Because if you remove three digits, you need at least four digits. So, n must have at least four digits. Wait, actually, if n is a three-digit number, removing three digits would leave nothing, which doesn&#39;t make sense. So, n must have at least four digits. So, n is at least 1000, and k is the cube root of n, which is obtained by removing the last three digits. So, k is n divided by 1000, but rounded down? Wait, no. Wait, for example, if n is 123456, then removing the last three digits would be 123. So, k is 123, and n would have to be 123^3. But 123^3 is 1860867, which is a seven-digit number. So, removing the last three digits of 1860867 gives us 1860, which is not equal to 123. So, that example doesn&#39;t work. Hmm.Wait, let me think again. Let me formalize this. Let&#39;s suppose n is a number such that when we remove the last three digits, we get k, which is the cube root of n. So, in other words, n = k^3, and k is equal to floor(n / 1000). Wait, but n is equal to k^3. So, substituting, we have k = floor(k^3 / 1000). So, k^3 must be a number such that when you divide it by 1000 and take the floor, you get k. So, k &lt;= k^3 / 1000 &lt; k + 1. Multiplying all parts by 1000, we get 1000k &lt;= k^3 &lt; 1000(k + 1). So, 1000k &lt;= k^3 &lt; 1000k + 1000. So, simplifying the first inequality: 1000k &lt;= k^3 =&gt; 1000 &lt;= k^2. So, k &gt;= sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62. So, k must be at least 32. For the upper inequality: k^3 &lt; 1000k + 1000. Let&#39;s write that as k^3 - 1000k - 1000 &lt; 0. Hmm. Let&#39;s find k where this is true.Let me compute for k=32:32^3 - 1000*32 -1000 = 32768 - 32000 -1000 = 32768 - 33000 = -232 &lt; 0. So, satisfies.k=33:33^3 - 1000*33 -1000 = 35937 - 33000 -1000 = 35937 - 34000 = 1937 &gt; 0. So, not satisfy.Wait, so the inequality k^3 - 1000k -1000 &lt; 0 holds for k=32, but not for k=33. So, the possible k is between 32 and... but k must be integer, so k=32. Let&#39;s check k=31 first. Wait, earlier inequality said k &gt;=32, since 1000 &lt;= k^2 =&gt; k &gt;=32.But let&#39;s confirm with k=31:k=31: 31^3=29791, then removing last three digits would be n=29791, remove last three digits: 29. But 29 is not equal to 31. So, no. So k must be at least 32. Then for k=32:n =32^3=32768. Removing the last three digits: 32768 -&gt; 32 (since last three digits are 768). So, 32. Which is equal to k=32. So, that works. Then k=32 is a solution. Then, next k=33:n=33^3=35937. Remove last three digits: 35 (since 937 are the last three digits). 35 !=33. So, no. Similarly, k=34: 34^3=39304. Remove last three digits: 39, which is not 34. Doesn&#39;t work. Wait, but according to the inequality earlier, k can only be 32, since for k=33 the inequality k^3 -1000k -1000 &lt;0 is not true. So, maybe only k=32. Let me check for k=32:Yes, 32768. Remove last three digits: 32, which is the cube root. So that works. Let&#39;s check k=31 again, even though the inequality says k &gt;=32. For k=31, n=29791. Remove last three digits: 29. But 29 !=31, so it&#39;s invalid. So, perhaps only k=32 is the solution.Wait, but let&#39;s check higher k. Wait, when k=100, n=1000000. Remove last three digits: 1000. Which is 1000, which is not equal to 100. So, doesn&#39;t work. So, perhaps k=32 is the only one. Wait, but maybe there are larger k where n= k^3, and when we remove the last three digits, we get k. So, is there another k where k^3 has at least three more digits than k? For example, if k is a four-digit number, then n=k^3 is a 12-digit number (if k=1000, n=1,000,000,000). Then removing the last three digits would give 1,000,000, which is 1000000, which is not equal to k=1000. So, that&#39;s not going to work. Wait, perhaps k is a three-digit number. Let&#39;s check.Take k=100. Then n=1,000,000. Remove last three digits: 1000. 1000 !=100. Not equal. k=123. n=1860867. Remove last three digits: 1860. 1860 !=123. Doesn&#39;t work. Hmm. So, seems like k=32 is the only possible one. Let me check k=10:n=1000. Remove last three digits: 1. 1 !=10. No. k=32 seems unique. Wait, but let me see if there&#39;s another k where k = floor(k^3 /1000). So, floor(k^3 /1000) =k. So, k^3 /1000 &gt;=k and &lt;k+1. So, k^3 &gt;=1000k and k^3 &lt;1000(k+1). The first inequality gives k^2 &gt;=1000, so k&gt;=32 (since 31^2=961 &lt;1000, 32^2=1024&gt;1000). The second inequality is k^3 &lt;1000k +1000. Let&#39;s rearrange it as k^3 -1000k -1000 &lt;0. Let&#39;s check for k=32: 32^3=32768; 1000k +1000= 32*1000 +1000=33000; 32768 -33000= -232 &lt;0. So, satisfies. For k=33:33^3=35937; 1000*33 +1000=34000; 35937-34000=1937&gt;0. So, does not satisfy. So, the inequality is only true for k=32. Therefore, k=32 is the only solution. Therefore, n=32^3=32768. So, the answer is 32768. Let me check once again. 32768, removing the last three digits: 32 and 768. So, 32, which is the cube root. Yes. So, that works. Let&#39;s check if there are any other possible numbers. Suppose someone says, maybe a number with more digits. Let&#39;s say n is a six-digit number. Then, removing the last three digits would give a three-digit number. So, if n is a six-digit number, k would be three digits. Let&#39;s see. Let k be a three-digit number, so k is from 100 to 999. Then n=k^3. So, n would be from 1,000,000 to 999^3≈997,002,999. So, n can be up to a nine-digit number. So, for example, if k=100, n=1,000,000. Remove last three digits: 1000, which is not 100. If k=101, n=1,030,301. Remove last three digits: 1030, which is not 101. So, that&#39;s not going to work. Similarly, if k=999, n=997,002,999. Remove last three digits: 997,002. Which is not 999. So, no. So, seems like only k=32 works. Maybe check k=32 in higher digit counts. Wait, k=32000. But that would be n=(32000)^3=32,768,000,000,000. Remove last three digits: 32,768,000,000. Which is 32768000000, which is way bigger than 32000. So, that&#39;s not equal. So, no. So, the only solution is 32768. Therefore, the answer is boxed{32768}.Final Answerboxed{32768}&lt;/think&gt;Given a positive integer ( n ), we need to determine ( n ) such that the cube root of ( n ) is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits.Let ( k ) be the cube root of ( n ). This means ( n = k^3 ). The problem states that removing the last three digits of ( n ) gives ( k ). Therefore, ( k ) must be the number formed by the digits of ( n ) excluding the last three digits. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:[ k = leftlfloor frac{n}{1000} rightrfloor ]Substituting ( n = k^3 ) into the equation, we get:[ k = leftlfloor frac{k^3}{1000} rightrfloor ]This implies:[ 1000k leq k^3 &lt; 1000(k + 1) ]Solving the inequalities:1. ( 1000k leq k^3 ) simplifies to ( k^2 geq 1000 ), so ( k geq sqrt{1000} approx 31.62 ). Hence, ( k geq 32 ).2. ( k^3 &lt; 1000(k + 1) )Testing ( k = 32 ):- ( 32^3 = 32768 )- Removing the last three digits of 32768 gives 32, which matches ( k ).Testing ( k = 33 ):- ( 33^3 = 35937 )- Removing the last three digits of 35937 gives 35, which does not match ( k ).For ( k geq 33 ), the inequality ( k^3 &lt; 1000(k + 1) ) does not hold, confirming that ( k = 32 ) is the only solution.Thus, the positive integer ( n ) is ( 32^3 = 32768 ).[boxed{32768}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find all positive integers n such that the cube root of n is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits. Hmm, let me try to understand the problem first. Let me paraphrase it: If I take the number n, and I remove its last three digits, I get the cube root of n. So for example, if n was a number like 123456, removing the last three digits would give me 123, and that should be the cube root of 123456. But obviously, 123 cubed is not 123456. So I need to find all numbers n where this is true.Let me formalize this. Let’s let k be the cube root of n. Then according to the problem, if I remove the last three digits of n, I get k. So removing the last three digits is equivalent to dividing by 1000 and taking the integer part, right? Because each digit in a decimal system represents a power of 10, so the last three digits are the ones, tens, and hundreds places. So if n is a number, say, with digits abcdef, then removing the last three digits would give me abc, which is equal to k. And then k cubed should be abcdef.Wait, but n is equal to k cubed. So, n = k³. But if we remove the last three digits of n, we get k. So another way to write this is that n divided by 1000, floored to an integer, is k. But since n = k³, then k³ / 1000 ≈ k, but actually, since removing the last three digits is equivalent to integer division by 1000, then k = floor(n / 1000). But n = k³, so substituting, k = floor(k³ / 1000). Hmm. So k must be approximately equal to k³ / 1000. Let me write this as an equation. But maybe instead of dealing with floors, perhaps n is exactly equal to k followed by three zeros plus something. But since removing the last three digits gives k, then n must be k multiplied by 1000 plus some three-digit number. But n is also equal to k³. So, k³ = 1000k + m, where m is a three-digit number (i.e., 0 ≤ m ≤ 999). Therefore, we have:k³ = 1000k + m, with 0 ≤ m ≤ 999.But m is the last three digits of n, so n = k³ = 1000k + m. Therefore, m = k³ - 1000k. But since m must be between 0 and 999 inclusive, then 0 ≤ k³ - 1000k ≤ 999.So this gives us two inequalities:1. k³ - 1000k ≥ 0 =&gt; k³ ≥ 1000k =&gt; k² ≥ 1000 =&gt; k ≥ sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62. So k must be at least 32.2. k³ - 1000k ≤ 999 =&gt; k³ - 1000k ≤ 999. Let&#39;s compute this for k starting at 32.But maybe it&#39;s better to write the equation as k³ - 1000k = m, where m is between 0 and 999. So solving for k in integers where k ≥ 32, and k³ - 1000k is between 0 and 999. Let&#39;s compute k³ - 1000k for k starting at 32:First, k = 32:32³ = 32*32*32 = 32*1024 = 327681000k = 32000So 32³ - 1000*32 = 32768 - 32000 = 768. That&#39;s m = 768. Which is within 0-999. So n = 32768. If we remove the last three digits, we get 32 (since 32768 -&gt; 32_768). And 32³ = 32768. So this works. So 32 is a solution.Next, k = 33:33³ = 33*33*33. Let&#39;s compute 33² = 1089, so 1089*33 = 359371000k = 33000m = 35937 - 33000 = 2937. But 2937 is more than 999. So this doesn&#39;t work. So m is too big.k = 34:34³ = 34*34*34. 34² = 1156, so 1156*34 = 393041000k = 34000m = 39304 - 34000 = 5304. Still way over 999.Similarly, k = 35:35³ = 35*35*35 = 42,8751000k = 35,000m = 42,875 - 35,000 = 7,875. Also too big.Wait, so k=32 gives m=768 which is okay, but starting from k=33, m becomes 2937, which is way over 999. So maybe there are no solutions beyond k=32?But let&#39;s check k=31 just to be sure. The lower bound was approximately 31.62, so k=31:31³ = 297911000k = 31000m = 29791 - 31000 = -1209. Which is negative, so that&#39;s invalid. So k must be at least 32.So k=32 gives a valid m, and k=33 onwards gives m exceeding 999. So the only solution is k=32, which gives n=32768.Wait, but let me check higher k just in case. Suppose k=100:100³ = 1,000,0001000k = 100,000m = 1,000,000 - 100,000 = 900,000. Which is way larger than 999.k=10:10³=1000, 1000*10=10,000. m=1000 -10,000 negative. So nope.But since k must be at least 32, and when k increases, k³ - 1000k grows rapidly. Let me analyze the function f(k) = k³ - 1000k.We can take derivative to see its growth, but since k is integer, maybe just observe that after k=32, the term k³ will dominate 1000k, so f(k) increases as k increases. So once f(k) exceeds 999 for k=33, it will keep increasing, so no further solutions.But wait, is that the case? Let me check k=32 gives 768, k=33 gives 2937, which is over 999, so that&#39;s too big. So once k exceeds 32, m exceeds 999. Therefore, the only solution is k=32.Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine all positive integers n&quot;. So maybe 32768 is the only solution. Let me verify once again.If we take n=32768, removing the last three digits gives 32, and 32³=32768. Correct. Any other numbers?Wait, let me test k=0. If k=0, then n=0³=0, but the problem states positive integers, so n=0 is excluded. k=1: n=1, removing last three digits would be 0 (since 1 is 0001 or something?), but 0 is not 1. So no. Similarly, k=10: n=1000. Removing last three digits gives 1, but 1³=1≠1000. So nope. So the only possible k is 32, leading to n=32768.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another k where k³ - 1000k is between 0 and 999. Since we saw that for k=32 it works, and for k=33 and above, the m is already 2937 which is way above 999, and increasing k further makes m even larger. So no, there are no other solutions.Hence, the only positive integer n is 32768.Final AnswerThe positive integer ( n ) is boxed{32768}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine all positive integers ( n ) such that the cube root of ( n ) is obtained by removing its last three decimal digits, we start by letting ( k ) be the cube root of ( n ). This means ( n = k^3 ) and removing the last three digits of ( n ) gives ( k ). Removing the last three digits of ( n ) is equivalent to dividing ( n ) by 1000 and taking the integer part. Therefore, we have:[k = leftlfloor frac{n}{1000} rightrfloor]Since ( n = k^3 ), substituting this into the equation gives:[k = leftlfloor frac{k^3}{1000} rightrfloor]This implies:[k^3 = 1000k + m quad text{where} quad 0 leq m leq 999]Rearranging, we get:[k^3 - 1000k = m]We need ( k ) such that ( 0 leq k^3 - 1000k leq 999 ). 1. For ( k geq 32 ):   - ( k = 32 ): ( 32^3 = 32768 )     - ( 1000 times 32 = 32000 )     - ( 32768 - 32000 = 768 ), which is between 0 and 999.   - ( k = 33 ): ( 33^3 = 35937 )     - ( 1000 times 33 = 33000 )     - ( 35937 - 33000 = 2937 ), which exceeds 999.For ( k geq 33 ), the value ( k^3 - 1000k ) continues to increase, thus exceeding 999. Checking ( k = 31 ) and lower values results in negative ( m ), which is invalid.Thus, the only valid solution is ( k = 32 ), leading to ( n = 32^3 = 32768 ).The positive integer ( n ) is (boxed{32768}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-db1da8c8></div><p class="review-content" data-v-db1da8c8><span class="icon" data-v-db1da8c8>🔑:</span>1.
