I need to find the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles using these points as vertices. Hmm, okay, let&#39;s start breaking this down.First, triangles are formed by three points. Since the lines are parallel, any three points that are all on line a or all on line b won&#39;t form a triangle—they&#39;ll be colinear. So every triangle must have at least two points from one line and one from the other, or all three points from different lines. Wait, but there are only two lines, so all three points would have to be two from one line and one from the other. Wait, no, three points can&#39;t all be on different lines because there are only two lines. So actually, every triangle must consist of two points from one line and one point from the other. Is that right? Yeah, because if you have three points, either two are on a and one on b, or two on b and one on a. So all triangles must be such.Now, the question is about acute-angled triangles. So I need to figure out under what conditions three points (two from one line, one from another) form an acute-angled triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, an acute triangle is one where all three angles are less than 90 degrees. Alternatively, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, if for a triangle with sides a, b, c (where c is the longest side), if a² + b² &gt; c², then the triangle is acute.But maybe there&#39;s a better way to think about it in terms of coordinates. Let me consider setting up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s assume lines a and b are horizontal for simplicity, since they are parallel. Let me place line a along the x-axis and line b along the line y = d, where d is the distance between the two lines.So, coordinates of points on line a would be (x_i, 0) and on line b would be (x&#39;_j, d), where i and j range from 1 to 50 each. Now, a triangle is formed by two points from one line and one from the other. Let&#39;s first consider two points on line a and one on line b. Let&#39;s denote them as A(x₁, 0), B(x₂, 0), and C(x&#39;, d). Then, we need to determine under what conditions triangle ABC is acute.Similarly, if we take two points on line b and one on line a, the analysis should be similar.So let&#39;s focus on two points on line a and one on line b first. Let&#39;s compute the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC. The sides are AB, AC, and BC. Since A and B are on line a, AB is |x₁ - x₂|. The other two sides, AC and BC, can be computed using the distance formula. Let me compute AC: sqrt((x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d²), and BC: sqrt((x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d²).Now, for triangle ABC to be acute, all three angles must be less than 90 degrees. So we need to check for each angle whether the corresponding condition holds.Alternatively, using the law of cosines, a triangle is acute if the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.So for triangle ABC, we need:AB² &lt; AC² + BC²,AC² &lt; AB² + BC²,BC² &lt; AB² + AC².Let me check these inequalities.First, AB² = (x₁ - x₂)^2,AC² = (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d²,BC² = (x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d².So, first inequality: AB² &lt; AC² + BC².Substituting:(x₁ - x₂)^2 &lt; [(x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d²] + [(x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d²]Simplify the RHS:(x&#39; - x₁)^2 + (x&#39; - x₂)^2 + 2d²So, (x₁ - x₂)^2 &lt; (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + (x&#39; - x₂)^2 + 2d²But let&#39;s expand (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + (x&#39; - x₂)^2:= x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁² + x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂²= 2x&#39;² - 2x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) + (x₁² + x₂²)And (x₁ - x₂)^2 = x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂²So substituting back:x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂² &lt; 2x&#39;² - 2x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) + (x₁² + x₂²) + 2d²Simplify both sides by subtracting x₁² + x₂²:-2x₁x₂ &lt; 2x&#39;² - 2x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) + 2d²Divide both sides by 2:- x₁x₂ &lt; x&#39;² - x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) + d²Bring all terms to left-hand side:- x₁x₂ - x&#39;² + x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) - d² &lt; 0Factor:x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) - x&#39;² - x₁x₂ - d² &lt; 0= x&#39;x₁ + x&#39;x₂ - x&#39;² - x₁x₂ - d² &lt; 0= -x&#39;² + x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) - x₁x₂ - d² &lt; 0Notice that -x&#39;² + x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) - x₁x₂ can be written as -(x&#39;² - x&#39;(x₁ + x₂) + x₁x₂) = - (x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂)Wait, let&#39;s check:(x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) = x&#39;² - x&#39;x₂ - x&#39;x₁ + x₁x₂So, -(x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) = -x&#39;² + x&#39;x₁ + x&#39;x₂ - x₁x₂Which matches the expression above. So the inequality becomes:- (x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) - d² &lt; 0Or,- (x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) &lt; d²Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):(x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) &gt; -d²So, the first inequality AB² &lt; AC² + BC² simplifies to (x&#39; - x₁)(x&#39; - x₂) &gt; -d².Hmm, interesting. Now, let&#39;s check the second inequality: AC² &lt; AB² + BC².So, (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d² &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d²Subtract d² from both sides:(x&#39; - x₁)^2 &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₂)^2Expand both sides:Left side: x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²Right side: x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂²Simplify right side:x₁² + x&#39;² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₂Subtract left side from both sides:0 &lt; (x₁² + x&#39;² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₂) - (x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²)Simplify:0 &lt; 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₂ + 2x&#39;x₁Divide both sides by 2:0 &lt; x₂² - x₁x₂ - x&#39;x₂ + x&#39;x₁Factor:x₂² - x₂(x₁ + x&#39;) + x&#39;x₁This can be written as (x₂ - x₁)(x₂ - x&#39;)Hmm, let me check:(x₂ - x₁)(x₂ - x&#39;) = x₂² - x&#39;x₂ - x₁x₂ + x&#39;x₁Yes, that&#39;s exactly the expression. So the inequality becomes:(x₂ - x₁)(x₂ - x&#39;) &gt; 0Similarly, the third inequality BC² &lt; AB² + AC² would give:(x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d² &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d²Subtract d²:(x&#39; - x₂)^2 &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₁)^2Expanding:x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂² &lt; x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²Simplify right side:2x₁² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁Subtract left side:0 &lt; 2x₁² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ - (x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂²)Wait, maybe better to subtract left side from right side:Right side - left side = [2x₁² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁] - [x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂²]= 2x₁² + 2x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ - x&#39;² + 2x&#39;x₂ - x₂²= 2x₁² + x₂² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ + 2x&#39;x₂ - x&#39;²Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let&#39;s follow the same method as before.Starting with BC² &lt; AB² + AC²:(x&#39; - x₂)^2 + d² &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₁)^2 + d²Cancel d²:(x&#39; - x₂)^2 &lt; (x₁ - x₂)^2 + (x&#39; - x₁)^2Expand:x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂² &lt; x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²Simplify RHS:2x₁² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ + 2x₂²Wait, no. Let me compute step by step:(x₁ - x₂)^2 = x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂²(x&#39; - x₁)^2 = x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²So, adding them: x₁² - 2x₁x₂ + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₁ + x₁²= 2x₁² + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁Subtract left side (x&#39;² - 2x&#39;x₂ + x₂²):2x₁² + x₂² + x&#39;² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ - x&#39;² + 2x&#39;x₂ - x₂²Simplify:2x₁² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ + 2x&#39;x₂Factor:2x₁² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ + 2x&#39;x₂ = 2x₁(x₁ - x₂) - 2x&#39;(x₁ - x₂) = 2(x₁ - x₂)(x₁ - x&#39;)Wait, 2x₁² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x&#39;x₁ + 2x&#39;x₂ = 2x₁² - 2x₁x₂ - 2x₁x&#39; + 2x₂x&#39;Factor:= 2x₁² - 2x₁(x₂ + x&#39;) + 2x₂x&#39;But perhaps factor differently:= 2x₁² - 2x₁x&#39; - 2x₁x₂ + 2x₂x&#39;= 2x₁(x₁ - x&#39; - x₂) + 2x₂x&#39;Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, factor out 2:= 2[ x₁² - x₁x₂ - x₁x&#39; + x₂x&#39; ]= 2[ x₁(x₁ - x₂ - x&#39;) + x₂x&#39; ]Alternatively, maybe factor terms:x₁² - x₁x₂ - x₁x&#39; + x₂x&#39; = x₁(x₁ - x₂ - x&#39;) + x₂x&#39;Hmm, maybe this is not helpful. Wait, perhaps group terms:x₁² - x₁x₂ - x₁x&#39; + x₂x&#39; = x₁² - x₁x₂ - x₁x&#39; + x₂x&#39;= x₁(x₁ - x₂ - x&#39;) + x₂x&#39;Not sure. Maybe another approach. Let&#39;s suppose that (x₁ - x₂)(x₁ - x&#39;) &gt;0. Wait, similar to the previous case.Alternatively, maybe the inequality BC² &lt; AB² + AC² simplifies to (x₁ - x₂)(x&#39; - x₁) &gt;0? Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s denote variables for clarity. Let me set variables:Let A = (x1, 0), B = (x2, 0), C = (x&#39;, d)Then, angle at A: between AB and AC.Vectors AB = (x2 - x1, 0), AC = (x&#39; - x1, d)The angle at A is the angle between AB and AC. To check if it&#39;s acute, the dot product should be positive.Dot product of AB and AC is (x2 - x1)(x&#39; - x1) + 0*d = (x2 - x1)(x&#39; - x1)So, if (x2 - x1)(x&#39; - x1) &gt; 0, then angle at A is acute.Similarly, angle at B: between BA and BC.Vectors BA = (x1 - x2, 0), BC = (x&#39; - x2, d)Dot product: (x1 - x2)(x&#39; - x2) + 0*d = (x1 - x2)(x&#39; - x2)So, angle at B is acute if (x1 - x2)(x&#39; - x2) &gt; 0.Angle at C: between CA and CB.Vectors CA = (x1 - x&#39;, -d), CB = (x2 - x&#39;, -d)Dot product: (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + (-d)(-d) = (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + d²So, angle at C is acute if (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + d² &gt; 0But since angles in a triangle must sum to 180 degrees, if two angles are acute, the third must be as well. Wait, no, that&#39;s not true. If two angles are less than 90, the third could be greater. For example, in a triangle with angles 80, 80, 20, the third is acute. Wait, but if two angles are 45, 45, then the third is 90. So, if two angles are acute, the third could be right or obtuse.Wait, but in reality, for a triangle to be acute, all three angles must be less than 90. So even if two angles are acute, the third might not be. Therefore, we need all three angles to be acute. Therefore, all three dot products must be positive? Wait, the dot product being positive means the angle is less than 90 degrees. So if the dot product is positive, the angle is acute, and if it&#39;s zero, it&#39;s right, and if it&#39;s negative, it&#39;s obtuse.Therefore, to have all three angles acute, all three dot products must be positive.Therefore, for triangle ABC with two points on a and one on b, the conditions are:1. (x2 - x1)(x&#39; - x1) &gt; 0 (angle at A is acute)2. (x1 - x2)(x&#39; - x2) &gt; 0 (angle at B is acute)3. (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + d² &gt; 0 (angle at C is acute)Similarly, if the triangle is formed by two points on line b and one on line a, the conditions would be analogous.So, let&#39;s parse each condition.First, for angle at A: (x2 - x1)(x&#39; - x1) &gt; 0. Let&#39;s denote x2 &gt; x1 without loss of generality. So if x2 &gt; x1, then (x2 - x1) is positive. Then, (x&#39; - x1) must be positive as well. Therefore, x&#39; &gt; x1. Similarly, for angle at B: (x1 - x2)(x&#39; - x2) &gt; 0. Since (x1 - x2) is negative (since x2 &gt; x1), then (x&#39; - x2) must also be negative. Therefore, x&#39; &lt; x2.Therefore, combining both conditions, we have x1 &lt; x&#39; &lt; x2. Wait, so if we have two points on line a, A and B, with x1 &lt; x2, then the point C on line b must lie between x1 and x2 for angles at A and B to be acute.Wait, but x&#39; is a point on line b. So if we fix A and B on line a, then the point C on line b must be between A and B&#39;s projections onto line b for the angles at A and B to be acute. Since lines a and b are parallel, projecting A and B onto line b would just be vertically above them. So if line b is parallel and shifted vertically, then the x-coordinate of C must lie between x1 and x2. So, in other words, if A is at (x1, 0) and B is at (x2, 0), then C must be at (x&#39;, d) where x1 &lt; x&#39; &lt; x2.But then, the third condition is (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + d² &gt; 0. Let&#39;s compute that. Let&#39;s substitute x1 &lt; x&#39; &lt; x2.Then (x1 - x&#39;) is negative, (x2 - x&#39;) is positive. So their product is negative. Therefore, (x1 - x&#39;)(x2 - x&#39;) + d² = negative + d². So this expression is d² - (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;).So we need d² - (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &gt; 0, which is equivalent to (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d².Therefore, combining all three conditions, for two points A and B on line a with x1 &lt; x2, and a point C on line b with x&#39; between x1 and x2, we need (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d².So the area of the rectangle formed by x&#39; - x1 and x2 - x&#39; must be less than d². Wait, but since x&#39; is between x1 and x2, (x&#39; - x1) and (x2 - x&#39;) are both positive, so their product is the area of a rectangle with sides (x&#39; - x1) and (x2 - x&#39;). So this product is the square of the geometric mean, which is maximized when x&#39; is the midpoint of x1 and x2, giving ( (x2 - x1)/2 )^2. So the maximum possible value of (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) is ((x2 - x1)/2)^2.Therefore, the condition (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d² is equivalent to ((x2 - x1)/2)^2 &lt; d², or |x2 - x1| &lt; 2d. Therefore, if the distance between A and B on line a is less than 2d, then there exists a point C on line b between them such that (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d². Wait, but actually, even if |x2 - x1| &gt;= 2d, there might still be points x&#39; where (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d². For example, if |x2 - x1| is very large, but x&#39; is near x1 or near x2, then the product would be small.Wait, let&#39;s think of (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) as a quadratic function in x&#39;. Let me set t = x&#39;, so the expression is (t - x1)(x2 - t) = -t² + (x1 + x2)t - x1x2. This is a quadratic opening downward, with maximum at t = (x1 + x2)/2, and the maximum value is ((x2 - x1)/2)^2. Therefore, the maximum of the product is ((x2 - x1)/2)^2, achieved at the midpoint. Therefore, the equation (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) = d² will have two solutions when ((x2 - x1)/2)^2 &gt; d², i.e., when |x2 - x1| &gt; 2d. Therefore, if |x2 - x1| &gt; 2d, then there are two points x&#39; where (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) = d², and between these two points, the product is greater than d², and outside, it&#39;s less. Wait, since the quadratic opens downward, the values of t where (t - x1)(x2 - t) &gt; d² are between the two roots. Wait, no. If the quadratic is -t² + (x1 + x2)t - x1x2 - d² = 0, then the solutions are where (t - x1)(x2 - t) = d², which, if |x2 - x1| &gt; 2d, would have two real roots. The region where (t - x1)(x2 - t) &gt; d² is between the two roots. Therefore, to have (t - x1)(x2 - t) &lt; d², x&#39; must be outside the interval [root1, root2].Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to rephrase.Given two points A(x1, 0) and B(x2, 0) on line a, with x1 &lt; x2, and line b at y = d, then the points C(x&#39;, d) on line b that make triangle ABC acute are those where x&#39; is between x1 and x2, and (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d².But how does this translate to the number of such points C?Wait, perhaps the key idea is that if the distance between A and B is less than 2d, then all points C between A and B on line b will satisfy (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d², since the maximum possible product is ((x2 - x1)/2)^2, which would be less than d² if x2 - x1 &lt; 2d.Alternatively, if the distance between A and B is greater than or equal to 2d, then there&#39;s a central region between two points on line b where the product (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) is greater than d², hence violating the third condition, but points outside that central region (but still between x1 and x2) would satisfy the third condition.Wait, this is confusing. Let&#39;s consider specific cases.Case 1: Distance between A and B is less than 2d.Suppose x2 - x1 &lt; 2d. Then, the maximum value of (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) is ((x2 - x1)/2)^2 &lt; (2d / 2)^2 = d². Therefore, (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d² for all x&#39; between x1 and x2. Therefore, in this case, all points C on line b between A and B will satisfy all three conditions (since x&#39; is between x1 and x2, angles at A and B are acute, and (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d² so angle at C is also acute). Therefore, for pairs A, B with distance less than 2d, all points C between them on line b will form an acute triangle.Case 2: Distance between A and B is equal to 2d.Then, maximum product is (2d / 2)^2 = d². Therefore, the midpoint C would give (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) = d², so at the midpoint, angle at C is right. So, all other points C between A and B except the midpoint would have (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d², hence angle at C is acute. So, only the midpoint would form a right triangle, others would be acute.Case 3: Distance between A and B is greater than 2d.Then, maximum product ((x2 - x1)/2)^2 &gt; d². Therefore, there will be two points C1 and C2 on line b between A and B where (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) = d². Between C1 and C2, the product is greater than d², so angle at C is obtuse. Outside of C1 and C2 (but still between A and B), the product is less than d², so angle at C is acute.However, since angles at A and B are acute only if x&#39; is between A and B, but within that interval, depending on x&#39;, angle at C could be acute or obtuse. Therefore, for pairs A, B with distance greater than 2d, the points C on line b that form an acute triangle are those outside the interval [C1, C2], but still between A and B. Therefore, two intervals: from A to C1 and from C2 to B. Each of these intervals would have points C where angle at C is acute.Therefore, the number of acute triangles formed by A, B, and C depends on the distance between A and B.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we should arrange the points such that as many pairs A, B as possible have distance less than 2d, so that all points C between them form acute triangles. If the distance is more than 2d, then only some C&#39;s will work.But the problem states that the points are distinct and marked on the lines, but we can choose their positions? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;50 distinct points marked on a and 50 distinct points marked on b&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify that the points are in any particular order or configuration. So perhaps we can arrange the points on lines a and b in such a way as to maximize the number of acute triangles. So the problem is asking for the greatest possible number, so we can choose the positions of the points.Therefore, the maximal number would be achieved by arranging the points such that as many pairs on each line are within distance less than 2d, so that all the points on the other line between them can form acute triangles.But how does the distance d relate to the positions? Wait, since we can choose the positions of the points, perhaps we can set d such that all pairs of points on one line are within distance less than 2d. But actually, d is the distance between the two parallel lines. Wait, but in the problem statement, the lines are given as parallel, but the distance between them is fixed? Or can we choose the distance d as part of the problem? Wait, no, the problem says &quot;Let a and b be parallel lines with 50 distinct points marked on a and 50 distinct points marked on b&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify the distance between them. Therefore, perhaps we can choose the distance d to optimize the number of acute triangles. However, since the problem is about the maximum possible number, regardless of the distance. Wait, but in the coordinate system, the actual value of d might affect the count. Hmm.Wait, actually, perhaps the distance d can be considered as arbitrary, but since we are to maximize over all possible configurations, including the distance between the lines. Therefore, we can choose d to be as small as possible so that 2d is larger than the maximum distance between any two consecutive points on line a or line b. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the points are placed in any particular way. Therefore, maybe we can arrange the points on each line in such a way that all adjacent points are within distance less than 2d, but since we can choose d as part of the configuration. Wait, but if we can choose d, then we can set d to be very large, making 2d larger than any distance between points on the lines, but that might not help. Alternatively, set d very small, such that 2d is smaller than the minimal distance between any two points on the lines. Wait, but the points are distinct, so the minimal distance is greater than zero.Wait, perhaps this is a projective geometry problem where we can scale the configuration. Since the problem is about the maximum number of acute triangles, the actual value of d might not matter because we can scale the configuration. For example, if we scale the entire configuration by a factor, the angles remain the same. Therefore, the number of acute triangles is independent of the actual distance d. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that d = 1/2, so that 2d = 1. Then, arranging the points such that all pairs of points on each line are within distance less than 1. But with 50 points on a line, if we arrange them all within an interval of length less than 1, then the distance between any two points is less than 1, which is equal to 2d. Wait, but if d = 1/2, then 2d = 1. Therefore, if we arrange all 50 points on line a within a length of 1, then any two points on line a will be within distance less than 1, so 2d. Then, any point on line b (which is at distance d = 1/2) will satisfy the condition that the product (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; d² = 1/4 for any two points x1, x2 on line a.Wait, but if two points on line a are at distance less than 2d = 1 apart, then the maximum product ((x2 - x1)/2)^2 &lt; (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so (x&#39; - x1)(x2 - x&#39;) &lt; 1/4. Therefore, in this case, all points C on line b between x1 and x2 will satisfy the third condition (angle at C is acute). Therefore, if we arrange all 50 points on line a within an interval of length less than 1, then every pair of points on line a will have all points on line b between them forming acute triangles.But line b also has 50 points. If we arrange all points on line b within the same interval, but shifted by d = 1/2, then the distance between the two lines is 1/2. However, this might not matter as long as the points on line b are within the projection of the interval on line a.Wait, but if we arrange all points on line a within a very small interval, say [0, ε], and all points on line b within [0, ε] as well, then the distance between the lines is d. But in this case, if d is fixed, say d = 1/2, but the points on both lines are within [0, ε], then the distance between any two points on the same line is less than ε, which can be made smaller than 2d by choosing ε &lt; 1. Therefore, all pairs on line a would have distance less than 2d, so all points on line b between them would form acute triangles. Similarly for pairs on line b.But how does this maximize the number of acute triangles?Wait, the total number of triangles is the number of ways to choose two points on one line and one on the other. So total triangles would be C(50, 2)*50 + C(50, 2)*50 = 2*C(50, 2)*50. But we need to find how many of these are acute.If all pairs on line a are within distance less than 2d, then all points on line b between them would form acute triangles. But how many points are on line b between any two points on line a? If all points on line a are in [0, ε] and all points on line b are in [0, ε], then for any two points x1, x2 on line a (with x1 &lt; x2), the points on line b between x1 and x2 are those in (x1, x2). If all points on line b are within [0, ε], then the number of points on line b between x1 and x2 is approximately proportional to the length x2 - x1. But if ε is very small, and all points are densely packed, then between any two points on line a, there are many points on line b.But in reality, the problem states that there are 50 distinct points on each line. So we can arrange the points on each line in any order. To maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points such that as many pairs as possible on each line have all points on the other line between them, hence forming acute triangles.The key idea here is that if we arrange all points on both lines in convex position, sorted along the line, then for any two points on one line, the number of points on the other line between them is maximized. Wait, but convex position on a line just means sorted order. If we arrange all points on line a in increasing order x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; x50, and similarly on line b as x&#39;_1 &lt; x&#39;_2 &lt; ... &lt; x&#39;50, then for any two points xi &lt; xj on line a, the number of points on line b between xi and xj is the number of x&#39;_k such that xi &lt; x&#39;_k &lt; xj.To maximize this number, we need the points on line b to interlace as much as possible with the points on line a. For example, if we interleave the points on line a and line b such that between every two consecutive points on line a, there are many points on line b. But since both lines have 50 points, the maximum number of points on line b between any two consecutive points on line a would be roughly 50 divided by 50, which is 1. But that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps arranging the points on both lines in the same order, so that for any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them. Wait, but that&#39;s impossible unless all points on line b are between the leftmost and rightmost points of line a. Similarly, if we arrange all points on both lines to lie within the same interval, then for any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them. Wait, that seems possible.Suppose we arrange all 50 points on line a in an interval [0, 1], and all 50 points on line b also in [0, 1]. Then, for any two points on line a, say at positions 0.3 and 0.7, all 50 points on line b (which are between 0 and 1) are between 0.3 and 0.7? No, only those points on line b that are between 0.3 and 0.7 would be between them. So if line b&#39;s points are spread out over [0,1], then the number of points on line b between any two points on line a depends on the specific positions.Alternatively, if we arrange all points on both lines to coincide in the same positions. For example, if line a has points at positions x1, x2, ..., x50, and line b has points at the same positions but shifted vertically by d. Then, for any two points xi and xj on line a, the points on line b between them are those xk where xi &lt; xk &lt; xj. If all points are sorted, then the number of such points is (j - i - 1). Therefore, for each pair (i, j) on line a, there are (j - i -1) points on line b between them.But how does this help in counting the number of acute triangles? For each pair (i, j) on line a, all points on line b between them would form acute triangles. Similarly, for each pair (i, j) on line b, all points on line a between them would form acute triangles.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to maximize the number of such pairs where the points on the other line between them are as many as possible.Wait, the total number of acute triangles would be the sum over all pairs on line a of the number of points on line b between them, plus the sum over all pairs on line b of the number of points on line a between them.Therefore, if we arrange both lines&#39; points in the same order, then the total number of acute triangles would be equal to twice the sum over all pairs (i, j) of the number of points between them on the other line.But how to compute this sum?For example, if the points on both lines are sorted in the same order, x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; x50 on line a, and x&#39;_1 &lt; x&#39;_2 &lt; ... &lt; x&#39;_50 on line b. Then, for a pair (xi, xj) on line a, the number of points on line b between them is the number of x&#39;_k such that xi &lt; x&#39;_k &lt; xj. If the points on line b are interleaved with those on line a, then this number depends on the interleaving.Alternatively, if we interleave the points such that between every two consecutive points on line a, there is one point from line b. For example, line a: x1, x3, x5, ..., x99 (if 50 points), but wait, 50 points. Maybe line a at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. Then, between any two consecutive points on line a, there&#39;s one point from line b. But in this case, for a pair (xi, xj) on line a where j = i + 1, there is one point on line b between them. For pairs further apart, there are more points. Wait, but this is just a specific arrangement.Alternatively, suppose all points on line a are positioned at x = 1, 2, ..., 50, and all points on line b are positioned at x = 1, 2, ..., 50 as well, but on the line y = d. Then, for any pair (i, j) on line a where i &lt; j, the number of points on line b between them is j - i - 1. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a pairs would be the sum over all i &lt; j of (j - i -1). Similarly for line b pairs.But then, the total number would be 2 * sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i -1). Let&#39;s compute this sum.For line a, sum_{i=1 to 49} sum_{j=i+1 to 50} (j - i -1). Let&#39;s substitute k = j - i -1. For each i, j ranges from i+1 to 50, so k ranges from 0 to 50 - i -1. So sum_{i=1 to 49} sum_{k=0 to 50 - i -1} k.Which is sum_{i=1 to 49} [ (50 - i -1)(50 - i)/2 ].This seems complicated, but let&#39;s compute it.Alternatively, note that for each pair (i, j) where j - i -1 = m, the number of such pairs is (50 - (m +1)) for m from 0 to 48. Wait, for m = 0: j - i -1 = 0 =&gt; j = i +1. There are 49 such pairs (i=1 to 49). For m = 1: j - i -1 =1 =&gt; j = i + 2. There are 48 such pairs. And so on, up to m = 48: j - i -1 =48 =&gt; j = i + 49. There is 1 such pair.Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{m=0}^{48} m*(50 - (m +1)) = sum_{m=0}^{48} m*(49 - m).Compute this sum:sum_{m=0}^{48} m*(49 - m) = sum_{m=0}^{48} (49m - m²) = 49*sum_{m=0}^{48} m - sum_{m=0}^{48} m²= 49*(48*49)/2 - (48)(49)(97)/6Wait, compute each term:sum_{m=0}^{48} m = sum_{m=1}^{48} m = (48)(49)/2 = 1176sum_{m=0}^{48} m² = sum_{m=1}^{48} m² = (48)(49)(97)/6 = Let&#39;s compute that:48/6 = 8, so 8*49*97 = 8*4753 = 38,024Wait, 49*97: 49*100=4900, minus 49*3=147, so 4900 -147=4753. Then 8*4753=38,024.Therefore, the sum is 49*1176 - 38,024Compute 49*1176: 1176*50 = 58,800, minus 1176 = 58,800 -1,176 = 57,624Then, 57,624 - 38,024 = 19,600Therefore, the sum over all pairs on line a is 19,600. Similarly for line b, another 19,600. So total acute triangles would be 39,200.But is this the maximum possible?Wait, but in this arrangement, all pairs (i, j) on line a contribute (j - i -1) acute triangles, assuming that the points on line b are at integer positions. However, this is under the assumption that for each pair (i, j) on line a, all points on line b between them satisfy the acute conditions. But in reality, we need to ensure that the distance between i and j is less than 2d, but in this case, since we can set d as we like, maybe we can choose d such that all distances between points on line a are less than 2d. Wait, but in this arrangement, the distance between consecutive points on line a is 1 unit. If we set d to be greater than 0.5, then 2d &gt;1, so the distance between consecutive points is less than 2d. Therefore, all pairs of points on line a with distance 1 unit (i.e., consecutive points) would allow all points on line b between them (which are 0 in this integer arrangement) to form acute triangles. Wait, no, in this arrangement, the points on line b are at the same x-coordinates as line a. So for example, if line a has points at x=1,2,...,50 and line b has points at x=1,2,...,50 on y=d. Then, for two points on line a at x=1 and x=2, the points on line b between them would be none, because the points on line b are at x=1 and x=2 as well. Wait, so in this case, between x=1 and x=2 on line a, there are no points on line b. Hence, the number of acute triangles formed by pairs on line a and points on line b would be zero? That can&#39;t be.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding here. If the points on line b are at the same x-coordinates as line a, then for two adjacent points on line a, there is no point on line b between them. Therefore, the number of acute triangles would be zero for such pairs. But for pairs that are further apart, say x=1 and x=3 on line a, the points on line b at x=2 would be between them. So in this case, the number of acute triangles would be the number of points on line b between them, which is 1 (x=2). Similarly, for x=1 and x=4 on line a, there are two points on line b between them (x=2 and x=3). So, in this arrangement, the number of acute triangles formed by two points on line a and one on line b is equal to the number of points on line b that lie strictly between them. Similarly for the other way.Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would be the sum over all pairs (i, j) on line a of the number of points on line b between i and j, plus the sum over all pairs (k, l) on line b of the number of points on line a between k and l.But if the points on both lines are at the same x-coordinates, then the number of points on line b between i and j is (j - i -1), and similarly for line a. Therefore, as computed earlier, each sum is 19,600, leading to a total of 39,200 acute triangles.However, is this the maximum possible?Alternatively, if we interleave the points on lines a and b such that between every two points on line a, there are as many points on line b as possible. For example, if line a has points at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b has points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. Then, between any two consecutive points on line a, there is one point on line b. For pairs two apart on line a (e.g., 1 and 5), there are two points on line b between them (2 and 4). Similarly, in this case, the number of points on line b between two points on line a is floor((j - i)/2). Wait, not exactly. For example, between x=1 and x=5 on line a, which are four units apart, the points on line b are at 2, 4, so two points. Hmm.But in this interleaved arrangement, the number of points on line b between any two points on line a is roughly half the distance between them. Whereas in the previous arrangement where both lines have the same positions, the number of points on line b between two points on line a is equal to the number of integer points between them, which is distance minus 1.Therefore, which arrangement gives a higher total? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we have two lines with points interleaved. For example, line a at odd integers, line b at even integers. Then, between any two points on line a, there&#39;s either 0 or 1 or more points on line b. For example, between x=1 and x=3 on line a, there&#39;s one point on line b (x=2). Between x=1 and x=5 on line a, there are two points on line b (x=2,4). In general, for a distance of 2k on line a (between x and x + 2k), there are k points on line b between them.Therefore, the number of points on line b between two points on line a separated by distance 2k is k. So if line a has points at 1,3,...,99, then the distance between the i-th and j-th point is 2*(j - i). So the number of points on line b between them is (j - i -1). Wait, no. For example, between 1 and 3 (distance 2), there is 1 point (2). So j - i =1, points on line b:1. Between 1 and 5 (distance 4), j - i=2, points on line b:2. So the number of points on line b between them is (j - i).Wait, if the distance between two points on line a is 2*(j - i), then the number of points on line b between them is (j - i). Therefore, the number of points on line b between two points i and j on line a is (j - i). Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a would be sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i). Similarly, the total for line b would be the same.For 50 points on each line, arranged at positions 1,3,...,99 on line a and 2,4,...,100 on line b, the total number of acute triangles would be sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{j=i+1}^{50} (j - i) * 1 (since each pair (i,j) contributes (j - i) points on line b between them).Compute this sum:For line a, sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{j=i+1}^{50} (j - i). Let k = j - i, then for each i, k ranges from 1 to 50 - i. So sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{k=1}^{50 - i} k = sum_{i=1}^{49} [ (50 - i)(50 - i +1)/2 - 0 ] = sum_{i=1}^{49} [ (51 - i)(50 - i)/2 ]This is equal to sum_{m=1}^{49} [ (m +1)(m)/2 ] where m = 50 - i.= sum_{m=1}^{49} [ m(m +1)/2 ] = sum_{m=1}^{49} (m² + m)/2 = [ sum_{m=1}^{49} m² + sum_{m=1}^{49} m ] / 2We know sum_{m=1}^n m = n(n +1)/2 and sum_{m=1}^n m² = n(n +1)(2n +1)/6.So for n=49:sum_{m=1}^{49} m = 49*50/2 = 1225sum_{m=1}^{49} m² = 49*50*99/6 = 49*50*99/6 = (49/6)*50*99 = but compute step by step:First, 49*50 = 24502450*99 = 2450*(100 -1) = 245,000 - 2,450 = 242,550Divide by 6: 242,550 / 6 = 40,425So sum_{m=1}^{49} m² = 40,425Therefore, sum becomes (40,425 + 1225)/2 = 41,650 /2 = 20,825Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a is 20,825 and similarly from line b another 20,825, totaling 41,650.Comparing this to the previous arrangement where both lines have points at the same positions, resulting in 39,200 acute triangles, the interleaved arrangement gives a higher total.Therefore, interleaving the points seems better.But is this the maximum?Wait, in this interleaved arrangement, each pair (i, j) on line a with j &gt; i contributes (j - i) acute triangles, since there are (j - i) points on line b between them. Similarly for line b.Alternatively, suppose we arrange the points such that the points on line b are densely packed between every two points on line a. For example, if line a has 50 points spaced out, and line b has 50 points all located between two specific points on line a. But then, most pairs on line a would have no points on line b between them, except those spanning the interval where line b&#39;s points are. This would likely result in fewer acute triangles.Therefore, to maximize the total, we need to spread out the points on line b as much as possible between the points on line a. Similarly for line a between line b&#39;s points.The interleaved arrangement seems optimal because it maximizes the number of points on the other line between any two points on one line.In the previous example with 50 points on each line, interleaved such that line a has odd positions and line b has even positions, the total number of acute triangles is 41,650.But perhaps there&#39;s a better way. Let&#39;s suppose that the points on both lines are arranged in a way that every point on line b is between any two points on line a. Wait, but with 50 points on each line, that&#39;s impossible unless all points on line b are between the leftmost and rightmost points of line a.But even so, how would you arrange them to maximize the betweenness.Alternatively, consider that the maximum number of acute triangles occurs when every pair of points on one line has all 50 points on the other line between them. But this is impossible unless all points on one line are between two points on the other line. For example, if all 50 points on line a are to the left of all 50 points on line b. Then, any two points on line a would have no points on line b between them, but any two points on line b would have all 50 points on line a between them. Therefore, the number of acute triangles would be C(50, 2)*50 = 61,250 (from line b pairs and line a points). But this can&#39;t be right, because the angle conditions would require that the points on line a are between the projections of the two points on line b.Wait, no. If all points on line a are to the left of all points on line b, then for two points on line b, say x&#39;_1 &lt; x&#39;_2, all points on line a are to the left of x&#39;_1, so there are no points on line a between x&#39;_1 and x&#39;_2, hence no acute triangles from line b pairs. Therefore, this arrangement would result in zero acute triangles.Alternatively, if all points on line b are between two points on line a. Suppose line a has two points, one at x=0 and one at x=1, and line b has all 50 points between 0 and1. Then, any two points on line a (just the two points) would have all 50 points on line b between them, resulting in C(2, 2)*50 = 50 acute triangles. But since line a has 50 points, this is not applicable.Wait, but if line a has 50 points spread out, and line b has all 50 points between two specific points on line a. Then, pairs of points on line a that span this interval would have all 50 points on line b between them, contributing 50 acute triangles per such pair. Other pairs would have zero.But with 50 points on line a, the number of pairs spanning the interval is C(48, 1) = 48 pairs (choosing one endpoint to the left and one to the right). Therefore, total acute triangles would be 48*50 = 2,400. Which is less than the previous total. Hence, this is worse.Therefore, the interleaved arrangement seems better.Alternatively, suppose we arrange both lines&#39; points in the same order, but alternating as much as possible. For example, line a: x1, x2, x3, ..., x50; line b: x1 + ε, x2 + ε, ..., x50 + ε, where ε is very small. Then, for any two points on line a, xi &lt; xj, the points on line b between them are those from xi + ε to xj + ε. Since ε is very small, the number of points on line b between xi and xj is the same as the number of points on line a between xi and xj, i.e., j - i -1. Therefore, this arrangement would be similar to the previous case where points on line b are at the same positions as line a, but shifted slightly. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would still be around 39,200, which is less than the interleaved case.Hence, the interleaved arrangement seems better.Therefore, perhaps the maximum number of acute triangles is achieved when the points on the two lines are interleaved as much as possible. In the case of 50 points on each line, arranging line a at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b at positions 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. Then, as computed earlier, the total number of acute triangles would be 20,825 * 2 = 41,650.But wait, let&#39;s verify this computation again.In the interleaved case, line a has points at 1, 3, ..., 99 (50 points) and line b at 2, 4, ..., 100 (50 points). For any two points on line a, say at positions 2i -1 and 2j -1 where i &lt; j, the number of points on line b between them is (j - i). For example, between 1 and 3 (i=1, j=2), there&#39;s one point at 2. Between 1 and 5 (i=1, j=3), two points at 2 and 4.Therefore, for each pair (i, j) on line a, where i &lt; j, the number of points on line b between them is (j - i). The total number of such pairs is C(50, 2) = 1225. The sum over all pairs of (j - i) is equal to sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{j=i+1}^{50} (j - i).Let&#39;s compute this sum:For each i from 1 to 49, j ranges from i+1 to 50. Let k = j - i. So for each i, k ranges from 1 to 50 - i. Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{k=1}^{50 - i} k = sum_{i=1}^{49} [ (50 - i)(50 - i +1)/2 ].Which is the same as sum_{m=1}^{49} [ m(m +1)/2 ] where m = 50 - i.As computed earlier, this sum is equal to 20,825. Similarly for line b.Therefore, total acute triangles are 20,825 * 2 = 41,650.But wait, let&#39;s test with smaller numbers to see if this holds.For example, suppose each line has 2 points. Line a at 1 and 3, line b at 2 and 4.Pairs on line a: (1,3). Number of points on line b between them:1 (point 2). Similarly, pairs on line b: (2,4). Points on line a between them:1 (point 3). Total acute triangles:1 +1 =2. But total possible triangles: C(2,2)*2 + C(2,2)*2= 2 +2=4. So acute triangles are half of them.But in reality, let&#39;s check. Triangle with points 1,3 (line a) and 2 (line b). Is this triangle acute? Let&#39;s compute the angles.Coordinates: A(1,0), B(3,0), C(2, d).AB distance:2. AC distance: sqrt(1 + d²). BC distance: sqrt(1 + d²).Law of cosines for angle at C: AB² vs AC² + BC². 4 vs 2(1 + d²). So 4 &lt; 2 + 2d² =&gt; 2 &lt; 2d² =&gt; d² &gt;1 =&gt; d &gt;1. If d &gt;1, then angle at C is acute. Angles at A and B: since C is between A and B, the angles at A and B are acute if d is non-zero. Wait, but according to the dot product conditions earlier, angles at A and B are acute if C is between A and B, which it is. Then, angle at C is acute if d² &gt; ((x&#39; - x1)(x2 -x&#39;)), which in this case is (2 -1)(3 -2)=1*1=1. So angle at C is acute if d² &gt;1. So if d &gt;1, then all angles are acute.If d=1, angle at C is right. If d &lt;1, angle at C is obtuse.But the problem states that the lines are parallel, but doesn&#39;t specify the distance. So to maximize the number of acute triangles, we can choose d as large as needed. If we set d &gt; sqrt( (x&#39; - x1)(x2 -x&#39;) ), which in this case sqrt(1), so d&gt;1. Therefore, by setting d sufficiently large, we can ensure that all such triangles are acute. Wait, but in reality, if we scale the entire configuration, the angles remain the same. Therefore, the actual value of d doesn&#39;t matter—it&#39;s the relative positions that matter.Wait, no. Because if we scale the configuration, the distance d scales as well. So angles are preserved under scaling. Therefore, the number of acute triangles is independent of the actual distance d. Therefore, if we arrange the points such that all the conditions (x&#39; - x1)(x2 -x&#39;) &lt; d² are satisfied, then all those triangles will be acute. But since we can choose the positions of the points, we can arrange them such that d is large enough so that (x&#39; -x1)(x2 -x&#39;) &lt; d² for all relevant x&#39;.Wait, but this is confusing. The positions of the points and the distance d are related. If we fix the positions of the points on the lines, then d is fixed. But if we can choose both the positions and d, then we can set d to be large enough so that all the products (x&#39; -x1)(x2 -x&#39;) &lt; d², which would be possible because for any fixed positions, d can be made large enough. However, in that case, the angles at C would all be acute. But angles at A and B also depend on the positions.Wait, but earlier we saw that for angles at A and B to be acute, x&#39; must be between x1 and x2. And angle at C is acute if (x&#39; - x1)(x2 -x&#39;) &lt; d². Therefore, if we choose d sufficiently large, then (x&#39; -x1)(x2 -x&#39;) &lt; d² is always true, because the left side is fixed and the right side can be increased by increasing d. Therefore, by choosing d large enough, we can ensure that all triangles where C is between A and B are acute. Hence, the maximum number of acute triangles would simply be the number of such triangles where C is between A and B.Therefore, if we can choose d to be large enough, then the number of acute triangles is equal to the number of triangles where C is between A and B, plus those where C is between B and A (but since they are on parallel lines, this is symmetric). Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would be the number of triples where two points are on one line, one point on the other line, and the single point is between the two points on the first line.Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of such triples where the single point is between the two points on the other line. Hence, to maximize this count, we should arrange the points such that as many as possible of these betweenness relations hold.Therefore, the maximum number is achieved when the points on both lines are interleaved in such a way that for any two points on one line, there are as many points as possible on the other line between them.Hence, this brings us back to the interleaved arrangement. For example, if we arrange the points on both lines alternately, then between any two consecutive points on one line, there is one point from the other line. For non-consecutive points, there are more points from the other line in between.Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would be maximized when the points are interleaved. In such a case, the number of acute triangles is equal to twice the sum over all pairs (i, j) on one line of the number of points on the other line between them.In the case of 50 points on each line, arranged in an interleaved fashion, the number of points on the other line between any two points on one line is equal to the number of intervals between them. For example, between positions 1 and 3 on line a, there&#39;s one point on line b. Between 1 and 5, two points, etc.This results in the total sum being 20,825 for each line, as computed earlier, leading to a total of 41,650 acute triangles.But let&#39;s check if this is indeed the maximum.Suppose we have two lines with points arranged in a complete interleaved manner, such that between any two points on one line, there is exactly one point from the other line. For example, line a: 1, 3, 5,...; line b: 2, 4, 6,... Then, for any two consecutive points on line a, there&#39;s one point from line b in between. For two points with one point in between on line a, there are two points from line b in between, and so on.In this arrangement, the number of points on line b between two points on line a separated by k positions is k. Hence, the total number of acute triangles from line a is sum_{k=1}^{49} k*(50 - k). Because there are (50 - k) pairs of points on line a separated by k positions, each contributing k acute triangles from line b.Wait, this might be another way to compute the same sum.Sum_{k=1}^{49} k*(50 -k) = sum_{k=1}^{49} (50k -k²) = 50*sum_{k=1}^{49} k - sum_{k=1}^{49} k²We know sum_{k=1}^{49} k = (49)(50)/2 = 1225Sum_{k=1}^{49} k² = 40,425 as before.Therefore, the sum is 50*1225 -40,425 = 61,250 -40,425 = 20,825. Which matches the previous result. Therefore, this computation is correct.Similarly, for line b, we get another 20,825.Therefore, the total is 41,650.But is there a way to arrange the points to get a higher total?Suppose instead of strictly interleaving, we arrange the points in a more dense cluster. For example, line a has points clustered in the first half, and line b has points clustered in the second half. Then, pairs spanning the overlap might have many points between them, but pairs within the cluster would have fewer.However, this likely results in a lower total sum, because many pairs would have few or no points between them.Alternatively, another arrangement: line a has points at positions 1, 2, ..., 50, and line b has points at positions 51, 52, ..., 100. Then, for any two points on line a, there are no points on line b between them, and vice versa. Therefore, total acute triangles would be zero. So that&#39;s bad.Another arrangement: line a has points at 1, 2, ..., 25, 76, 77, ..., 100, and line b has points at 26, 27, ...,75. Then, pairs on line a that include one from the left cluster and one from the right cluster would have many points on line b between them, contributing 50 points each. But there are 25*25 = 625 such pairs, each contributing 50 acute triangles, totaling 31,250. Pairs within the left or right cluster would have no points on line b between them. Similarly for line b, pairs spanning the gap would have 25 points on line a between them, leading to another 31,250. Total acute triangles: 62,500. Which is higher than the interleaved case.Wait, this seems higher. Let&#39;s verify.If line a has two clusters: left cluster with 25 points at 1-25, right cluster with 25 points at 76-100. Line b has 50 points at 26-75.Then, any pair on line a with one from left and one from right cluster (total 25*25=625 pairs) would have all 50 points on line b between them, contributing 50 acute triangles each: 625*50=31,250.Similarly, any pair on line b with one from left cluster (26-50) and one from right cluster (51-75) would have 25 points on line a between them (76-100 vs 1-25). Wait, no. Points on line a are at 1-25 and 76-100. So for a pair on line b at 26 and 75, the points on line a between them would be 1-25 and 76-100. But 26-75 on line b are between 1-25 and 76-100 on line a? No, actually, in this arrangement, the points on line a are split into two clusters, left and right, and line b is in the middle.Therefore, for a pair on line b, say 26 and 75, there are no points on line a between them because line a&#39;s points are either less than 26 or greater than 75. Therefore, there are no points on line a between 26 and75. Therefore, such pairs on line b would contribute zero acute triangles.Wait, this is a problem. So maybe the acute triangles from line b would be only pairs within the left cluster or within the right cluster.But line b has points at 26-75, which is a single cluster. Therefore, pairs on line b would have points on line a between them only if the line a points are between them. However, line a&#39;s points are at 1-25 and76-100, which are outside the range of line b&#39;s points (26-75). Therefore, there are no points on line a between any two points on line b. Hence, all pairs on line b would contribute zero acute triangles.Similarly, pairs on line a within the left cluster or right cluster would have no points on line b between them, contributing zero. Only cross-cluster pairs on line a contribute.Therefore, total acute triangles:31,250 from line a cross-cluster pairs.But that&#39;s lower than the interleaved arrangement&#39;s total of 41,650.Wait, but wait, another arrangement. Suppose line a has points at 1-50 and line b has points at 51-100. Then, pairs on line a have no points on line b between them, and vice versa. Total acute triangles:0.Alternatively, if line a has points at 1-25 and 51-75, and line b has points at26-50 and76-100. Then, cross-cluster pairs on line a (1-25 and51-75) would have points on line b between them (26-50), contributing 25*25=625 pairs *25 points=15,625. Similarly for line b pairs (26-50 and76-100) contributing another 15,625. Total:31,250. Still less than interleaved.Alternatively, another arrangement where line a has points in three clusters and line b has points in between. But this complicates things.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the maximum number of acute triangles occurs when every pair of points on one line has as many points as possible from the other line between them. The maximum possible number of points between two points on one line is 50 (all points on the other line). This would require that all points on the other line are between every pair of points on the first line. However, this is only possible if all points on the other line are between the two extreme points on the first line. But since there are 50 points on each line, this would require that the other line&#39;s points are between the leftmost and rightmost points of the first line. If we arrange the first line&#39;s points such that the leftmost and rightmost points are far apart, and all points on the other line are in between, then any pair on the first line that includes the leftmost and rightmost points would have all 50 points on the other line between them. However, other pairs on the first line would have fewer points.For example, suppose line a has two points at x=0 and x=100, and 48 points in between. Line b has 50 points between 0 and100. Then, the pair (0,100) on line a would have all 50 points on line b between them, contributing 50 acute triangles. Other pairs on line a would have varying numbers of points on line b between them. However, this arrangement&#39;s total would depend on the distribution.But the maximum contribution would be if all pairs on line a have all 50 points on line b between them. But this is impossible unless all points on line a are the same, which they can&#39;t be. Therefore, only pairs that span the entire range of line b would have all 50 points between them.Therefore, such an arrangement would not maximize the total.Alternatively, the interleaved arrangement maximizes the number of points on the other line between pairs by spreading them out evenly.Therefore, perhaps the interleaved arrangement gives the maximum total.Alternatively, here&#39;s another approach. For two sets of points on two parallel lines, the number of acute triangles is maximized when the points are arranged such that every pair of points on one line has as many points as possible from the other line between them. To maximize the total, we need to maximize the sum over all pairs (i, j) on each line of the number of points on the other line between i and j.This sum is known in combinatorics as the total number of inversions or the total number of intervals. It is maximized when the two sets of points are interleaved as evenly as possible.For two sets of n points each, the maximum total,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles that can be formed with vertices on two parallel lines, each with 50 distinct points. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.First, parallel lines a and b each have 50 points. All triangles must have three vertices, so at least one point from each line? Wait, no. If they are all on one line, they can&#39;t form a triangle. So every triangle must have at least one point from each line. But since there are two lines, each triangle must have two points on one line and one on the other. Because three points on two lines can&#39;t all be on the same line (since that would be colinear). So triangles must be either 2 points from line a and 1 from line b, or 2 from line b and 1 from line a.Now, we need to count all such triangles and then figure out how many of them are acute-angled. But the problem is asking for the greatest possible number, so depending on how the points are arranged, the number of acute triangles might vary. So the configuration of the points on the lines can affect the number of acute triangles. Therefore, the problem is about arranging the 50 points on each line in such a way that when connected, as many triangles as possible are acute.Wait, but the points are marked on each line, but the lines are parallel. So maybe the positions of the points on each line relative to each other will determine the angles of the triangles. Hmm. Let&#39;s think about this.Suppose we have two horizontal parallel lines, a and b. Let&#39;s fix their positions. Let me imagine line a above line b. The distance between the lines will matter for the angles, but since the problem doesn&#39;t specify coordinates, maybe we can assume the distance is fixed, but perhaps the configuration of points can be arranged to maximize acute triangles.But how do the positions of the points affect the angles of the triangle? Let&#39;s take a triangle with two points on line a and one point on line b. Let&#39;s name the points: points A and B on line a, and point C on line b. The triangle ABC. The angles in this triangle depend on the positions of A, B, and C.Since lines a and b are parallel, the segment AB is horizontal (assuming lines are horizontal), and the segments AC and BC connect to point C on the lower line. The angles at A and B will be angles between the horizontal line a and the slanting lines to C. The angle at C will be between the two slanting lines.To determine if a triangle is acute, all three angles must be less than 90 degrees. So in triangle ABC, we need to ensure that all angles at A, B, and C are acute.Similarly, for a triangle with two points on line b and one on line a, the same applies.So the problem reduces to arranging the points on lines a and b such that as many of these triangles as possible have all three angles acute.But how to compute this? Let&#39;s recall some geometry. In a triangle, if all sides satisfy the triangle inequality, and specifically, for a triangle to be acute, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.But perhaps there&#39;s a better way to analyze the angles here. Since two of the points are on one line and the third is on the other, maybe we can use coordinate geometry.Let&#39;s assign coordinates. Let’s set line a as the x-axis, so all points on line a have coordinates (x, 0), and line b is parallel to line a, so let&#39;s set it as y = h for some height h. Then points on line b have coordinates (x, h).Now, take two points on line a: A = (a, 0) and B = (b, 0), and one point on line b: C = (c, h). Then triangle ABC has coordinates A(a, 0), B(b, 0), C(c, h).Similarly, for two points on line b and one on line a: C = (c, h), D = (d, h), and E = (e, 0). Then triangle CDE is similar.So, for triangle ABC, we can compute the vectors AB, AC, and BC to find the angles.But maybe there&#39;s a geometric property we can use. Since lines a and b are parallel, the lines AC and BC will form two sides of the triangle. The angle at C is formed by the lines AC and BC. The angles at A and B depend on the positions of C relative to A and B.Wait, if points A and B are on line a, and C is on line b, then the triangle ABC has one vertex on line b and two on line a. The angle at C is determined by the lines from C to A and C to B. The angles at A and B are determined by the lines from A to B and A to C, and from B to A and B to C.Given that lines a and b are parallel, maybe we can use some properties of transversals and parallel lines. The angles at A and B would involve the angle between the horizontal line (along a) and the slanting line to C.Alternatively, maybe using coordinates is better. Let&#39;s set specific coordinates to make it easier. Let’s suppose line a is the x-axis (y=0) and line b is the line y=1 (so h=1). Then, points on a are (x_i, 0) and on b are (y_j, 1).Take two points on a: (x1, 0) and (x2, 0), and one point on b: (y, 1). Let&#39;s compute the angles of triangle formed by these points.First, compute the vectors:At point A (x1, 0):The vectors are AB = (x2 - x1, 0) and AC = (y - x1, 1).The angle at A is the angle between AB and AC. Similarly, at point B (x2, 0), the angle is between BA = (x1 - x2, 0) and BC = (y - x2, 1). At point C (y, 1), the angle is between CA = (x1 - y, -1) and CB = (x2 - y, -1).To check if all angles are acute, we can compute the dot products. If the dot product of two vectors forming an angle is positive, the angle is acute; if it&#39;s zero, it&#39;s right; if negative, it&#39;s obtuse.Wait, actually, the sign of the dot product tells us about the angle. The dot product formula is:u ⋅ v = |u||v|cosθSo, if u ⋅ v &gt; 0, then cosθ &gt; 0, so θ is acute (0 &lt; θ &lt; 90). If u ⋅ v = 0, θ is right. If u ⋅ v &lt; 0, θ is obtuse.Therefore, for each angle, we can compute the dot product of the vectors forming the angle. If all three dot products are positive, the triangle is acute.But since we need all three angles to be acute, we need all three dot products to be positive.So let&#39;s compute the dot products for each angle in triangle ABC.First, at point A:Vectors AB = (x2 - x1, 0) and AC = (y - x1, 1). The dot product is (x2 - x1)(y - x1) + 0*1 = (x2 - x1)(y - x1). For this to be positive, (x2 - x1)(y - x1) &gt; 0.Similarly, at point B:Vectors BA = (x1 - x2, 0) and BC = (y - x2, 1). The dot product is (x1 - x2)(y - x2) + 0*1 = (x1 - x2)(y - x2). Which is the same as (x2 - x1)(x2 - y). So for positivity, (x1 - x2)(y - x2) &gt; 0, which is equivalent to (x2 - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; 0. Wait, maybe it&#39;s getting confusing.Alternatively, since x1 and x2 are points on line a, we can assume without loss of generality that x1 &lt; x2. Then, the vector AB is (positive, 0), and BA is (negative, 0).Then, at point A, the vectors AB (right) and AC (to point C). The dot product is (x2 - x1)(y - x1). Since x2 &gt; x1, the sign depends on (y - x1). If y &gt; x1, then positive; if y &lt; x1, negative.Similarly, at point B, the vectors BA (left) and BC (to point C). The dot product is (x1 - x2)(y - x2) = -(x2 - x1)(y - x2). Since x2 - x1 is positive, the sign is determined by -(y - x2). So if y &lt; x2, then -(y - x2) = x2 - y, which is positive. So if y &lt; x2, the dot product is positive; else, negative.At point C, vectors CA and CB. Let&#39;s compute their dot product.Vector CA is (x1 - y, -1) and CB is (x2 - y, -1). The dot product is (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + (-1)(-1) = (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + 1.For this to be positive, (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + 1 &gt; 0.So, in order for the angle at C to be acute, we need (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + 1 &gt; 0.Therefore, the three conditions for triangle ABC to be acute are:1. (x2 - x1)(y - x1) &gt; 0 (Angle at A)2. -(x2 - x1)(y - x2) &gt; 0 (Angle at B)3. (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + 1 &gt; 0 (Angle at C)But since x2 &gt; x1 (we assumed that), x2 - x1 &gt; 0. So condition 1 simplifies to y - x1 &gt; 0 =&gt; y &gt; x1.Condition 2: -(x2 - x1)(y - x2) &gt; 0. Since x2 - x1 &gt; 0, this is equivalent to -(y - x2) &gt; 0 =&gt; y - x2 &lt; 0 =&gt; y &lt; x2.So conditions 1 and 2 together imply that x1 &lt; y &lt; x2.Condition 3: (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + 1 &gt; 0. Let&#39;s expand this:(x1 - y)(x2 - y) = x1x2 - x1y - x2y + y²So, x1x2 - y(x1 + x2) + y² + 1 &gt; 0.Alternatively, we can write it as (y - x1)(y - x2) + 1 &gt; 0.But since (y - x1)(y - x2) is the product of (y - x1) and (y - x2). Since from conditions 1 and 2, y is between x1 and x2, so y - x1 &gt; 0 and y - x2 &lt; 0, so their product is negative. Therefore, (y - x1)(y - x2) = negative number. Let&#39;s denote D = (y - x1)(y - x2). Then, D + 1 &gt; 0 =&gt; D &gt; -1.Therefore, condition 3 is that (y - x1)(y - x2) &gt; -1.But since (y - x1) and (y - x2) are distances? Wait, but we need to relate this to the actual coordinates. Wait, in our coordinate system, the vertical distance between the lines is 1 (since we set h=1). If the vertical distance is different, this would affect the calculation. But we arbitrarily set h=1 for simplicity.Wait, in reality, the vertical distance h between the two lines will affect the calculation. If the lines are further apart, the term involving h would come into play. But since the problem didn&#39;t specify, maybe we can set h=1 to make calculations easier, but actually, h is fixed, so perhaps we need to consider h as a variable. Hmm, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the distance between the lines. But in order to have triangles, the lines must be separated, but maybe the answer doesn&#39;t depend on the actual distance? Wait, but in our condition 3, the term +1 comes from the dot product of the vertical component. If h is not 1, then the vertical component would be h instead of 1.Wait, let me check. If line b is at y = h, then the vectors CA and CB would have a vertical component of -h. So, their dot product would be (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + h². Therefore, condition 3 would be (x1 - y)(x2 - y) + h² &gt; 0.So, if h is the vertical distance between the lines, then the third condition becomes (y - x1)(y - x2) &lt; h².Therefore, in general, (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². Wait, since (x1 - y)(x2 - y) = (y - x1)(y - x2) = -(y - x1)(x2 - y). So, (x1 - y)(x2 - y) = - (y - x1)(x2 - y). Therefore, condition 3 is - (y - x1)(x2 - y) + h² &gt; 0 =&gt; (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h².So, (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h².But (y - x1)(x2 - y) is equal to (x2 - x1)(y - x1) - (y - x1)^2? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute.Wait, (y - x1)(x2 - y) = yx2 - y² - x1x2 + x1y = y(x2 + x1) - y² - x1x2. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, note that (y - x1)(x2 - y) is the product of the horizontal distances from y to x1 and x2, but since y is between x1 and x2, both (y - x1) and (x2 - y) are positive. Therefore, their product is positive. Therefore, condition 3 is (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h².So, the three conditions become:1. y &gt; x1 (from angle at A)2. y &lt; x2 (from angle at B)3. (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h² (from angle at C)Therefore, combining 1 and 2, we have x1 &lt; y &lt; x2, and then the third condition is that the product of the distances from y to x1 and x2 must be less than h squared.Therefore, given two points x1 and x2 on line a, the points y on line b that lie between x1 and x2 and satisfy (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h² will form an acute triangle with x1 and x2.Similarly, for two points on line b and one on line a, the same logic applies.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points on lines a and b such that for as many pairs (x1, x2) on line a, there are as many y on line b between x1 and x2 such that (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h², and vice versa for pairs on line b.But how does the arrangement of points affect this? If we can arrange the points such that the intervals (x1, x2) on line a overlap with many points y on line b such that (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h², then we can have many acute triangles.But perhaps arranging the points in a certain order can maximize this.Wait, but since the problem states that the points are &quot;distinct points marked on a&quot; and &quot;distinct points marked on b&quot;. So we can choose their positions? Or are they fixed? Wait, the problem says &quot;Find the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles&quot;, so we can arrange the points on lines a and b in any order to maximize the number. Therefore, the positions of the 50 points on each line can be chosen optimally.Therefore, our task reduces to arranging 50 points on line a and 50 points on line b (each line with 50 distinct points) such that the number of triples (two on one line, one on the other) forming acute triangles is maximized.So first, let&#39;s consider how to arrange the points. Since the condition involves points on line b lying between pairs on line a and satisfying (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h², we need to maximize the number of such y for each pair (x1, x2). Similarly for pairs on line b.But how? Let&#39;s analyze the third condition: (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h².Let me denote d1 = y - x1 and d2 = x2 - y. Then, d1*d2 &lt; h².But d1 + d2 = x2 - x1. Let’s denote L = x2 - x1. Then, the product d1*d2 is maximized when d1 = d2 = L/2, and the maximum product is (L/2)^2. So, for the product d1*d2 to be less than h², we need (L/2)^2 &lt; h² =&gt; L &lt; 2h. Therefore, if the distance between x1 and x2 is less than 2h, then all points y between x1 and x2 will satisfy d1*d2 &lt;= (L/2)^2 &lt; h², so (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². Therefore, if L &lt; 2h, then all y between x1 and x2 satisfy the third condition. If L &gt;= 2h, then there exists y between x1 and x2 such that d1*d2 &gt;= h², so those y would not satisfy the third condition.Wait, this seems important. So for a pair of points x1 and x2 on line a, separated by distance L = x2 - x1:- If L &lt; 2h, then all y on line b between x1 and x2 will satisfy (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². Therefore, all such y will form an acute triangle with x1 and x2.- If L &gt;= 2h, then only those y where (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h² will form acute triangles. The values of y that satisfy this are the ones closer to the center. Specifically, solving d1*d2 &lt; h², with d1 + d2 = L.So, solving d1*d2 &lt; h². Let’s set d1 = t, then d2 = L - t. Then, t(L - t) &lt; h² =&gt; -t² + Lt - h² &lt; 0 =&gt; t² - Lt + h² &gt; 0.The quadratic equation t² - Lt + h² = 0 has roots at t = [L ± sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2. Therefore, the inequality t² - Lt + h² &gt; 0 holds when t &lt; [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2 or t &gt; [L + sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2. But since t must be between 0 and L (since y is between x1 and x2), then the solutions are t &lt; [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2 or t &gt; [L + sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2. Therefore, the regions near x1 and x2 where d1 &lt; [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2 or d2 &lt; [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2.Wait, but that&#39;s a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can visualize the product (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². If we fix x1 and x2, this is a quadratic inequality in y. The maximum of the quadratic occurs at y = (x1 + x2)/2, and the maximum value is (L/2)^2. So, if L &lt; 2h, then the maximum is (L/2)^2 &lt; h², so all y between x1 and x2 satisfy the inequality. If L &gt;= 2h, then the inequality is satisfied for y in two intervals: from x1 to x1 + h and from x2 - h to x2. Wait, let me check.Suppose L &gt;= 2h. Then, solving (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h².Let me set x1 = 0 and x2 = L for simplicity, so we have y(L - y) &lt; h².This is equivalent to -y² + Ly - h² &lt; 0.The roots of the equation -y² + Ly - h² = 0 are y = [L ± sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2.Therefore, the inequality -y² + Ly - h² &lt; 0 holds when y &lt; [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2 or y &gt; [L + sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2.But since y is between 0 and L, the solution is two intervals: [0, [L - sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2) and ([L + sqrt(L² - 4h²)]/2, L].So, the regions near x1 and x2 where y is within [x1, x1 + (L - sqrt(L² - 4h²))/2) and (x2 - (L - sqrt(L² - 4h²))/2, x2]. But since sqrt(L² - 4h²) = sqrt{(L - 2h)(L + 2h)}, which is less than L, so (L - sqrt(L² - 4h²))/2 is a positive number.But maybe there&#39;s a simpler way to see this. Let&#39;s approximate for large L. If L is much larger than h, then sqrt(L² - 4h²) ≈ L - 2h²/L. Therefore, (L - sqrt(L² - 4h²))/2 ≈ (L - (L - 2h²/L))/2 ≈ (2h²/L)/2 ≈ h²/L. So the interval near x1 is approximately h²/L, which is small. Similarly near x2. So for large L, the regions where y satisfies the inequality are small intervals near x1 and x2.But in any case, for a pair of points x1, x2 on line a with distance L:- If L &lt; 2h, all y between x1 and x2 satisfy the inequality, so all such y form acute triangles.- If L &gt;= 2h, only y near x1 and x2 (within certain distances) satisfy the inequality, so fewer y&#39;s form acute triangles.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles with two points on a and one on b, we need as many pairs (x1, x2) on a with L &lt; 2h as possible, so that all y between them contribute to acute triangles. For pairs with L &gt;= 2h, only some y&#39;s contribute.Similarly, for triangles with two points on b and one on a, the same applies. So the strategy would be to arrange points on each line such that as many pairs as possible are within distance less than 2h, and for those pairs that are further apart, arrange points on the other line near the endpoints to satisfy the inequality.But since h is fixed (distance between the lines), how can we set h? Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify h, so perhaps h is arbitrary. Wait, but the answer cannot depend on h because it&#39;s not given. Therefore, maybe h is considered to be 1 unit, and the coordinates are scaled accordingly. But in that case, h is a constant, so the value 2h is fixed.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved combinatorially, without considering the specific geometric positions. Maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange the points such that every triangle is acute, but that seems impossible because, for example, if three points are colinear, the triangle is degenerate, but even if they are not colinear, triangles can have obtuse angles.But the problem states &quot;all of whose vertices are marked,&quot; so we need to consider all possible triangles with vertices on the marked points, and count how many are acute. The question is asking for the maximum possible number over all configurations of points.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s a way to arrange the points so that most triangles are acute.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number is achieved when all possible triangles with two points on one line and one on the other are acute. But that&#39;s not possible because, as we saw, depending on the distance between the two points on the same line, some triangles will be obtuse.But maybe if we arrange the points such that every pair of points on one line are within distance less than 2h. Then, for every pair on one line, all points on the other line between them would form acute triangles.But how to arrange 50 points on a line such that every pair is within distance less than 2h? That would require the entire set of points on each line to lie within an interval of length less than 2h. But since lines are infinite, but the problem says &quot;marked on a&quot;, so maybe the points can be placed anywhere on the lines, regardless of order. Wait, but if we cluster all points on each line within a segment of length less than 2h, then any two points on one line would be within less than 2h apart, so all y on the other line between them would satisfy (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². Therefore, all such triangles would be acute.Wait, but if we cluster all points on line a within a segment of length less than 2h, and similarly for line b, then for any two points on line a, all points on line b between them would form acute triangles. But line b has 50 points. If we arrange line b&#39;s points spread out over a longer interval, then for pairs on line a, the points on line b between them would be limited.But if we cluster both lines&#39; points within intervals of length less than 2h, then any two points on one line are within less than 2h apart, so all points on the other line between them would form acute triangles. However, since both lines are clustered, the points on the other line might not all lie between every pair on the first line.Wait, for example, suppose all points on line a are clustered in a small interval, say from 0 to S &lt; 2h, and all points on line b are also clustered in a small interval from 0 to T &lt; 2h. Then, take two points on line a: since they&#39;re within S, which is &lt;2h, then any point on line b between them will form an acute triangle. But if line b&#39;s points are also clustered near 0 to T, then if line a&#39;s points are from 0 to S and line b&#39;s from 0 to T, then for two points on line a, say at positions x1 and x2 near S, the points on line b would need to be between x1 and x2. But if line b&#39;s points are all near 0 to T, and x1 and x2 are near S, then line b&#39;s points would not lie between x1 and x2 unless T &gt;= x1 and T &gt;= x2. But if S and T are both less than 2h, but arranged such that the intervals overlap, then some points on line b would lie between some pairs on line a.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the optimal arrangement is to interleave the points on both lines. For example, arrange the points on line a and line b in such a way that their projections on the horizontal axis are interleaved, so that between any two points on one line, there are many points on the other line.Alternatively, arrange the points in a grid-like fashion where each point on line a is aligned with a point on line b, but shifted slightly. But I need to think more carefully.Wait, suppose we arrange both lines&#39; points in the same order along the x-axis. For example, line a has points at positions 1, 2, 3, ..., 50, and line b has points at positions 1 + ε, 2 + ε, ..., 50 + ε, where ε is a small positive number. Then, for any two points on line a, say at i and j, the points on line b between them would be from approximately i + ε to j + ε. Since the distance between i and j is j - i, which for adjacent points is 1, so if ε is small, the distance between i and j is 1, so 1 &lt; 2h (if h is 1 unit, then 2h=2), so if the vertical distance h is 1, then 1 &lt; 2, so all pairs of adjacent points on line a would allow all points on line b between them to form acute triangles. But for non-adjacent pairs on line a, say distance 2, then 2 &lt; 2h would require h &gt; 1, but if h=1, then 2h=2, so 2=2h, which is the threshold. Hmm, but for h=1, pairs on line a with distance L=2 would have maximum product (L/2)^2 =1, which equals h², so the inequality becomes (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt;1. At the midpoint, (y -x1)(x2 - y)=1, so equality. So triangles formed with midpoint y would have a right angle at C. Therefore, to have acute triangles, we need to exclude the midpoint. So for L=2, h=1, the points y on line b that are strictly between x1 and x2 (excluding midpoint) would satisfy (y -x1)(x2 - y) &lt;1.But if we arrange the points on line b such that they are not at the midpoints, then we can have acute triangles. However, if points on line b are densely packed between x1 and x2, then some of them would be near the midpoint, causing obtuse angles.Alternatively, if we stagger the points on line b so that they are not aligned with the midpoints of pairs on line a.But this is getting too vague. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that in order to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to maximize the number of triples (two on one line, one on the other) that satisfy the three conditions.Given that, perhaps the optimal configuration is when the points on each line are arranged in convex position, such that no three points are colinear, but since they are on a line, convex position doesn&#39;t apply. Alternatively, arrange the points such that for any two points on one line, there are as many points as possible on the other line lying between them.But the number of points on the other line between two points depends on the order of the points. If the points on both lines are sorted in the same order, then for any two points on line a, the number of points on line b between them is maximized when the points on line b are interleaved with those on line a.Wait, for example, if we arrange the points on line a at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (50 points), and points on line b at positions 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 (50 points). Then, between any two consecutive points on line a, there is exactly one point on line b. But if we have more points on line b between each pair on line a, then we can have more acute triangles.But since there are 50 points on each line, if we interleave them such that between every two points on line a, there are k points on line b, then k could be maximized. However, with 50 points on each line, the maximum number of interleaved points would require alternating positions.But let&#39;s think in terms of permutations. If we arrange the points on both lines in the same order, then the number of points on line b between two points on line a is roughly the difference in their ranks. If we arrange them in a way that maximizes the number of overlapping intervals.Wait, perhaps the problem reduces to counting the number of triples where two points are on one line and one is on the other, and the single point is between the two points on the other line. Then, if we can maximize the number of such betweenness relations, we can maximize the number of acute triangles.Because, as per the earlier conditions, for a triple (x1, x2, y) where y is between x1 and x2 on the projection, then angles at A and B are acute (if y is between x1 and x2), but we still need to check the angle at C. However, as we saw, if the distance between x1 and x2 is less than 2h, then all y between them will satisfy the third condition. If the distance is greater, then only y near the ends will. But if we arrange points such that all pairs on each line are within distance less than 2h, then all y between them will satisfy the third condition.Therefore, to ensure that all triples where y is between x1 and x2 form acute triangles, we need the distance between any two points on a line to be less than 2h. How can we do that? By clustering all points on each line within an interval of length less than 2h. But how?Since the lines are parallel and the points are distinct, we can place all 50 points on line a within a very small interval, say [0, ε], where ε &lt; 2h. Similarly, place all 50 points on line b within [0, ε]. Then, any two points on line a will be within ε of each other, so less than 2h, so all y on line b between them (which would be all points on line b, since they&#39;re all within [0, ε]) would form acute triangles. But wait, if all points on line a are in [0, ε] and all points on line b are also in [0, ε], then for any two points x1 and x2 on line a (which are within [0, ε]), the points y on line b that are between x1 and x2 are those in the intersection of [x1, x2] and [0, ε]. But since all y are in [0, ε], if x1 and x2 are also in [0, ε], then [x1, x2] is within [0, ε], so all points y on line b are between x1 and x2 if and only if y is in [x1, x2]. But since line b&#39;s points are spread throughout [0, ε], the number of y between x1 and x2 depends on how many points are in that interval.Wait, but if we arrange both lines&#39; points in the same interval [0, ε], but interleaved, then between any two points on line a, there can be multiple points on line b.But to maximize the number of triples where y is between x1 and x2, we need to maximize the number of such y for each pair x1, x2.If we arrange the points on both lines in the same interval, sorted in the same order, then for each pair x1 &lt; x2 on line a, all y on line b such that x1 &lt; y &lt; x2 will be between them. If the points on line b are interleaved with those on line a, then the number of y between x1 and x2 can be maximized.For example, suppose we arrange the points on both lines in an alternating fashion: a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., a50, b50 on the x-axis. But since the lines are parallel and separated vertically, their x-axis positions can overlap. Wait, but in reality, each line has its own y-coordinate, so overlapping x-axis positions are allowed.Therefore, if we arrange the points such that for every point on line a, there is a corresponding point on line b at the same x-coordinate, but on different y-coordinates. Then, for any two points on line a, there are no points on line b between them unless there are points on line b with x-coordinates between them. But if we interleave the x-coordinates of line b&#39;s points with those of line a, then between any two consecutive points on line a, there is a point on line b.However, with 50 points on each line, if we interleave them perfectly, we can have 49 points on line b between the 50 points on line a. Wait, no. If we interleave 50 points on line a with 50 points on line b, we would have 100 positions: a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., a50, b50. But since there are only 50 points on each line, the maximum interleaving would require alternating a and b points. However, since they are on separate lines, their x-coordinates can be the same? No, wait, the points are on different lines, so even if they have the same x-coordinate, they are different points. So for example, line a has points at x1, x2, ..., x50, and line b has points at the same x-coordinates. But in that case, projecting onto the x-axis, they are overlapping. Then, for any two points on line a, say at xi and xj, the points on line b between them would be the ones with x-coordinates between xi and xj. If the points on both lines are sorted in the same order, then between xi and xj on line a, there are j - i - 1 points on line a, and similarly for line b. But if the x-coordinates are the same, then the points on line b between xi and xj are exactly those with x-coordinates between xi and xj. Therefore, if we arrange the x-coordinates of both lines to be the same set, sorted, then for any two points on line a, the number of points on line b between them is equal to the number of points on line b with x-coordinates in that interval. If we interleave the points, such that line a and line b alternate in x-coordinates, then between any two adjacent points on line a, there is one point from line b. But since there are 50 points on each line, interleaving would require 100 positions, but we can only place 50 on each line. So perhaps not all can be interleaved.Alternatively, if we arrange the points such that the x-coordinates of line a and line b are interlaced as much as possible. For example, line a has points at 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b has points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. Then, between any two points on line a (e.g., 1 and 3), there is one point from line b (2). Similarly, between 3 and 5, there&#39;s 4, etc. But in this case, each pair of consecutive points on line a has exactly one point from line b between them. So for each such pair, we get one acute triangle. But there are 49 such consecutive pairs, each contributing one point on line b. However, we can do better by arranging the points such that more points on line b lie between pairs on line a.Alternatively, if we arrange the points in a grid-like structure where each point on line a is surrounded by multiple points on line b. But since both lines have 50 points, perhaps arranging them in a way that maximizes the number of incidences where a point on one line lies between two points on the other line.This seems related to combinatorial geometry problems, like the maximum number of incidences between points and intervals. Maybe using the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem or similar. But I might be overcomplicating.Wait, maybe the maximum number is achieved when the points on both lines are in general position, such that every pair of points on one line has as many points as possible on the other line between them. To maximize this, we can arrange the points on each line in such a way that they form a grid, maximizing the number of overlaps.Alternatively, think of the problem as two sets of points on the real line (the x-axis projections for each parallel line), and we want to maximize the number of triples (A, B, C) where A and B are on one line, C is on the other line, and C lies between A and B.This is equivalent to, for two sets S and T on the real line, maximizing the number of pairs (A, B) in S and C in T such that C lies between A and B.This is a classic problem in combinatorics. The maximum number is achieved when S and T are interleaved as much as possible.According to the well-known result, if we have two sets S and T of n points each on the real line, the maximum number of such triples is n²(n-1)/2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Wait, for each point C in T, the number of pairs (A, B) in S such that C lies between A and B is equal to the number of pairs where A &lt; C &lt; B or B &lt; C &lt; A. If S is sorted as x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn, then for a given C, the number of pairs (A, B) where A &lt; C &lt; B is equal to the number of elements less than C multiplied by the number of elements greater than C. Similarly for the other direction.Therefore, to maximize the total number of such triples, we need to arrange S and T such that for each C in T, the product of the number of S points less than C and greater than C is maximized. This is similar to the problem of maximizing the sum over all C in T of (left_S(C) * right_S(C)), where left_S(C) is the number of S points left of C, and right_S(C) is the number right of C.To maximize this sum, the arrangement of S and T should be such that the points of T are interleaved with the points of S as evenly as possible.In other words, merge the two sorted lists of S and T in an alternating fashion. For example, if S and T are each of size n, interleave them as s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn. This way, each ti is between si and si+1, so for each ti in T, left_S(ti) = i and right_S(ti) = n - i, so the product is i(n - i). Summing over all ti, this gives sum_{i=1 to n} i(n - i) = n sum i - sum i² = n(n(n+1)/2) - n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Let me compute this.Wait, no. Wait, if we have S = {s1, s2, ..., sn} and T = {t1, t2, ..., tn} interleaved as s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn, then each ti is between si and si+1 (assuming the interleave is perfect). But in reality, with n points on each line, the merged sequence would have 2n points. However, in this case, each ti is between si and si+1. Therefore, for each ti, left_S(ti) = i (since there are i points of S to the left of ti: s1, s2, ..., si), and right_S(ti) = n - i (points si+1, ..., sn). Therefore, the product is i(n - i). Summing over all ti, we have sum_{i=1 to n-1} i(n - i) + for tn, which would be after sn, so left_S(tn) = n, right_S(tn) = 0, product 0. Wait, but in the interleaved arrangement, tn comes after sn, so there&#39;s no si+1 after sn. So actually, each ti for i from 1 to n is between si and si+1, but sn+1 doesn&#39;t exist. Therefore, tn would be after sn, so left_S(tn) = n, right_S(tn) = 0, product 0. Therefore, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n-1} i(n - i) + 0 = sum_{i=1 to n-1} i(n - i).Similarly, for each si in S, the number of pairs (C, D) in T such that C &lt; si &lt; D is left_T(si) * right_T(si). Since the points are interleaved, s1 is before t1, so left_T(s1) = 0, right_T(s1) = n. Product 0. s2 is after t1 but before t2, so left_T(s2) = 1, right_T(s2) = n - 1. Product 1*(n - 1). Similarly, up to sn, which is after tn-1 but before tn, so left_T(sn) = n - 1, right_T(sn) = 1. Product (n - 1)*1. Therefore, sum over si is sum_{i=1 to n} left_T(si)*right_T(si) = sum_{i=1 to n} (i - 1)(n - (i - 1) - 1) = sum_{i=1 to n} (i - 1)(n - i). This is equivalent to sum_{k=0 to n-1} k(n - 1 - k) = sum_{k=0 to n-1} k(n - 1 - k).Therefore, the total number of triples where two points are on one line and one on the other, with the single point between the two, is sum_{i=1 to n-1} i(n - i) + sum_{k=0 to n-1} k(n - 1 - k). But this seems complicated.Wait, actually, the total number of such triples is for each line: two points on that line, one on the other line between them. So for line a, the number is sum over all pairs (A, B) on a of the number of points on b between A and B. Similarly for line b.In the interleaved arrangement, for line a:Each pair (si, sj) with i &lt; j has (j - i - 1) points of T between them. Wait, no. If interleaved as s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn, then between si and sj (i &lt; j), there are (j - i - 1) points of T. For example, between s1 and s2, there is t1. Between s1 and s3, there are t1 and t2. So, in general, between si and sj, there are (j - i - 1) points of T.But the number of pairs (A, B) on line a with k points of T between them is (n - k - 1) for k from 0 to n - 1.Therefore, the total number of triples for line a is sum_{k=0 to n - 1} (n - k - 1) * k. Similarly for line b.Wait, but this might not be the case. Let me think. If the points are interleaved as s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn, then the number of points on T between si and sj is (j - i - 1). For example, between s1 and s2: j - i - 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, no. Wait, between s1 and s2, there is t1. So number of T points between them is 1. Similarly, between s1 and s3, there are t1 and t2, so 2. So in general, between si and sj where j &gt; i, there are (j - i - 1) T points. Therefore, the number of T points between si and sj is (j - i - 1).Therefore, for each line a, the number of triples is the sum over all i &lt; j of (j - i - 1). Similarly for line b.So total number of triples is 2 * sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i - 1).But let&#39;s compute this sum. For line a:sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=i+1 to n} (j - i - 1). Let&#39;s let k = j - i - 1. For each i, j goes from i + 1 to n, so k goes from 0 to n - i - 1. Therefore, sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{k=0 to n - i - 1} k.Which is sum_{i=1 to n} [ (n - i - 1)(n - i) ) / 2 ].This simplifies to sum_{m=0 to n - 1} [ m(m + 1)/2 ] where m = n - i - 1. Wait, changing variables: let m = n - i - 1, then when i = 1, m = n - 2; when i = n, m = -1. Hmm, this is getting messy.Alternatively, note that the total number of triples for line a is sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i - 1). Let&#39;s compute this.For j = i + 1: (j - i - 1) = 0. So no contribution.For j = i + 2: 1. There are (n - 2) such pairs.For j = i + 3: 2. There are (n - 3) such pairs....For j = i + k: (k - 1). There are (n - k) such pairs.So the sum is sum_{k=2 to n} (k - 1)(n - k + 1). Wait, no. Wait, for each k from 2 to n, the number of pairs with j - i = k is (n - k). And each contributes (k - 1). Therefore, sum_{k=2 to n} (k - 1)(n - k).Similarly, sum_{k=2 to n} (k - 1)(n - k) = sum_{m=1 to n-1} m(n - m - 1), where m = k - 1.= sum_{m=1 to n-1} [m(n - 1) - m²]= (n - 1) sum_{m=1 to n-1} m - sum_{m=1 to n-1} m²= (n - 1) * [ (n - 1)n / 2 ] - [ (n - 1)n(2n - 1)/6 ]= (n - 1)n(n - 1)/2 - (n - 1)n(2n - 1)/6= (n - 1)n [ (3(n - 1) - (2n - 1)) / 6 ]= (n - 1)n [ (3n - 3 - 2n + 1) / 6 ]= (n - 1)n [ (n - 2) / 6 ]= n(n - 1)(n - 2)/6.Wait, that&#39;s the same as combination formula C(n, 3). So the total number of triples for line a is C(n, 3), and similarly for line b, so total triples is 2*C(n, 3).But wait, this contradicts my earlier thought. If we interleave the points, the total number of triples where a point on one line lies between two points on the other line is 2*C(n,3). For n=50, that would be 2*(50*49*48)/6 = 50*49*16.But wait, but if we arrange the points in a completely interleaved fashion, then between any two points on one line, there&#39;s a point on the other line. Wait, no. If you have 50 points on each line, interleaved alternately, then between any two consecutive points on line a, there is one point from line b. Therefore, for line a, the number of pairs (i, i+1) is 49, each contributing one point from line b. But the total number of triples would be 49*1 + ... For non-consecutive pairs, if they have more points between them. Wait, but in the calculation above, we arrived at 2*C(n, 3). Let&#39;s check with n=2. For n=2, C(2,3)=0, but if we have two points on each line, interleaved as a1, b1, a2, b2. Then for line a, the pair (a1, a2) has one point b1 between them (but in the projection, between a1 and a2 is b1 and b2). Wait, no. If a1 is at position 1, b1 at 2, a2 at 3, b2 at 4. Then between a1(1) and a2(3) on line a, the points on line b between them are b1(2). So one point. Therefore, triples from line a: 1, and from line b: similarly 1. Total triples: 2. But 2*C(2,3)=0, which doesn&#39;t match. Therefore, my previous calculation must be wrong.Wait, clearly there&#39;s a mistake. The formula C(n, 3) for the number of triples arises in different contexts, but here it seems misplaced. Let&#39;s re-examine.If we have two sets S and T each of size n, and we interleave them perfectly on the real line, then for each of the n - 1 gaps between consecutive points in S, there is one point from T. Similarly, for each gap in T, one point from S. Therefore, the number of triples where a point from T lies between two points from S is n - 1. Similarly, vice versa. But that only counts consecutive pairs. However, non-consecutive pairs may also have points between them.For example, in the interleaved arrangement S = {s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn}, the pair (s1, s3) in S has t1 and t2 between them. Therefore, the number of points from T between s1 and s3 is 2. Similarly, the number of triples for this pair is 2. So for all pairs (si, sj) in S, the number of T points between them is (j - i - 1). Therefore, the total number is sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i - 1).For n=3:Pairs in S: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).Number of T points between them:Between s1 and s2: t1 -&gt; 1Between s1 and s3: t1, t2 -&gt; 2Between s2 and s3: t2 -&gt; 1Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.Similarly for T, total triples: 4 + 4 = 8. For n=3, 2*C(3,3)=2*1=2, which is different. Therefore, my previous assertion that it&#39;s 2*C(n,3) is incorrect.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the sum sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i - 1).For n=3:i=1, j=2: 0i=1, j=3: 3 - 1 - 1 =1i=2, j=3: 0Wait, this contradicts the earlier count. Wait, if the points are interleaved as s1, t1, s2, t2, s3, t3, then between s1 and s2 is t1, between s2 and s3 is t2, between s1 and s3 are t1 and t2. But according to the formula sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i - 1), for n=3:i=1, j=2: 2 - 1 - 1 = 0i=1, j=3: 3 - 1 - 1 = 1i=2, j=3: 3 - 2 - 1 = 0Total: 1. But actual count is 2 (t1 and t2 between s1 and s3). So the formula is not matching. Therefore, my approach is flawed.Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let&#39;s think in terms of the merged sequence.When we interleave S and T, each pair (si, sj) in S has (number of T points between them) equal to the number of T points in the interval (si, sj).If S and T are interleaved as s1, t1, s2, t2, ..., sn, tn, then:- Between s1 and s2: t1- Between s1 and s3: t1, t2- Between s1 and s4: t1, t2, t3...- Between s1 and sn: t1, t2, ..., tn-1- Similarly, between s2 and s3: t2- Between s2 and s4: t2, t3...Therefore, the total number of T points between pairs in S is:For s1: sum_{k=1 to n-1} kFor s2: sum_{k=1 to n-2} k...For sn-1: 1Total sum is sum_{i=1 to n-1} sum_{k=1 to n - i} k} = sum_{i=1 to n-1} [ (n - i)(n - i + 1)/2 ]This is a more complex sum. Let&#39;s compute it for n=3:sum_{i=1 to 2} [ (3 - i)(3 - i + 1)/2 ]i=1: (2)(3)/2 = 3i=2: (1)(2)/2 = 1Total: 4, which matches the manual count.For n=2:sum_{i=1 to 1} [ (2 - 1)(2 - 1 + 1)/2 ] = (1)(2)/2 = 1. Which matches: between s1 and s2, there is t1.But according to the previous example, for n=2, total triples from S would be 1, from T also 1, total 2.Similarly, for n=3, total triples from S would be 4, from T also 4, total 8.But how to compute this sum for general n.The total number of T points between pairs in S is sum_{i=1 to n-1} [ (n - i)(n - i + 1)/2 ]Let’s make a substitution m = n - i. When i=1, m=n-1; when i=n-1, m=1.So sum_{m=1 to n-1} [ m(m + 1)/2 ] = sum_{m=1 to n-1} [ (m² + m)/2 ] = [ sum_{m=1 to n-1} m² + sum_{m=1 to n-1} m ] / 2We know that sum_{m=1 to k} m = k(k+1)/2 and sum_{m=1 to k} m² = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6.So for k = n - 1:sum_{m=1 to n-1} m = (n - 1)n / 2sum_{m=1 to n-1} m² = (n - 1)n(2n - 1)/6Therefore,sum = [ (n - 1)n(2n - 1)/6 + (n - 1)n / 2 ] / 2= [ (n - 1)n(2n - 1 + 3) / 6 ] / 2= [ (n - 1)n(2n + 2) / 6 ] / 2= [ (n - 1)n(2)(n + 1) / 6 ] / 2= [ (n - 1)n(n + 1) / 3 ] / 2= (n - 1)n(n + 1)/6Therefore, the total number of T points between pairs in S is (n - 1)n(n + 1)/6.Similarly, the total number of S points between pairs in T is also (n - 1)n(n + 1)/6.Therefore, the total number of triples is 2 * (n - 1)n(n + 1)/6 = (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3.For n=2, this gives (1*2*3)/3 = 2, which matches.For n=3, (2*3*4)/3 = 8, which matches.For n=50, the total number of triples would be (49*50*51)/3 = 49*50*17 = 49*850 = 41650.But wait, this is the total number of triples where a point on one line is between two points on the other line, assuming perfect interleaving.But remember, in our problem, we need these triples to also satisfy the third condition, i.e., (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h². In the case where all pairs on each line are within distance less than 2h, then all these triples would form acute triangles. Therefore, if we can arrange the points such that all pairs on each line are within 2h apart, then the total number of acute triangles would be equal to the total number of such triples, which is (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3.But how can we ensure that all pairs on each line are within distance less than 2h? If we cluster all points on each line within an interval of length less than 2h. For example, set all points on line a within [0, 2h - ε] and all points on line b within [0, 2h - ε]. Then, any two points on line a are within 2h - ε, so less than 2h, thus satisfying L &lt; 2h. Therefore, all y between them on line b would satisfy the third condition, making all such triples acute.But in order to cluster all points within an interval of length less than 2h, we need to have the distance between the farthest points on each line less than 2h. So if we arrange all 50 points on line a within [0, S], where S &lt; 2h, and similarly for line b.However, in this case, the number of points on line b between two points on line a depends on the overlap between their intervals. If both lines are clustered within the same interval [0, S], then between any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them only if line b&#39;s points are within [x1, x2]. But if all points on both lines are within [0, S], then for any two points x1 and x2 on line a, the points on line b between them are those in [x1, x2]. If line b&#39;s points are spread throughout [0, S], then the number of points between x1 and x2 is proportional to the length of [x1, x2]. To maximize this, we need to overlap the points as much as possible.But if we interleave the points on both lines within the interval [0, S], sorted in the same order, then between any two points on line a, there are multiple points on line b. For example, if both lines have 50 points densely packed within [0, S], sorted in increasing order, then between any two points on line a, there are approximately 50 points on line b between them, but in reality, since there are only 50 points on each line, the exact number depends on the overlap.But perhaps the maximum number of acute triangles is achieved when the points are interleaved as much as possible within the interval, ensuring that every pair on one line has as many points as possible on the other line between them, and all pairs are within distance less than 2h.Therefore, if we can arrange the points in such a way, the total number of acute triangles would be the total number of triples where a point is between two others on the other line, which we calculated as (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3. For n=50, this gives (49*50*51)/3 = 41650. Since we have two types of triangles (two on a, one on b, and two on b, one on a), and this formula accounts for both, the total number is 41650.But wait, in our earlier example with n=2, this formula gives 2 triangles, which matches: two triangles, one with two points on a and one on b, and vice versa. For n=3, 8 triangles, which also makes sense.However, the problem states &quot;distinct points marked on a and 50 distinct points marked on b&quot;. If we arrange the points in the interleaved manner, but the vertical distance h is such that all pairs on a are within 2h, then all triples counted by this formula are acute. Therefore, the maximum number of acute triangles is 2*C(n,3) + 2*C(n,2), wait, no.Wait, no, according to the previous calculation, the total number of acute triangles is (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3. For n=50, that&#39;s 49*50*51/3 = 49*50*17 = 41650.But let me verify with a small n. Take n=2:Lines a and b each have 2 points. If arranged as a1, b1, a2, b2 on the x-axis (projection), then the distance between a1 and a2 is 1 (assuming spacing 1). If the vertical distance h=1, then 2h=2. Since the horizontal distance between a1 and a2 is 1 &lt; 2h=2, then all points on b between a1 and a2 (which is b1) form acute triangles. Similarly, points on a between b1 and b2 (which is a2) form acute triangles. So total acute triangles:For line a: pairs (a1, a2) with b1 between them: 1 triangle.For line b: pairs (b1, b2) with a2 between them: 1 triangle.Total: 2. Which matches the formula (2 - 1)*2*(2 + 1)/3 = 1*2*3/3 = 2.Another example, n=3:Total acute triangles: 8.According to the formula: (3 - 1)*3*(3 + 1)/3 = 2*3*4/3 = 8.If arranged as a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, then the acute triangles would be:From line a:(a1, a2) with b1(a1, a3) with b1, b2(a2, a3) with b2Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.From line b:(b1, b2) with a2(b1, b3) with a2, a3(b2, b3) with a3Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.Total: 8.So it matches.Therefore, in general, the formula (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3 gives the total number of acute triangles when the points are perfectly interleaved and all pairs on each line are within distance less than 2h. Hence, this should be the maximum.Therefore, for n=50, the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles is (50 - 1)*50*(50 + 1)/3 = 49*50*51/3.Calculating this:49*50 = 24502450*51 = 2450*50 + 2450*1 = 122500 + 2450 = 124,950124,950 / 3 = 41,650.Therefore, the maximum number is 41,650.However, the problem states &quot;all of whose vertices are marked,&quot; so we need to ensure that all these triangles are indeed acute. In our analysis, we assumed that all such triples would form acute triangles because the pairs on each line are within distance less than 2h. Therefore, for each triple, the third condition (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt; h² is automatically satisfied because (y - x1)(x2 - y) &lt;= (L/2)^2 &lt; h² if L &lt; 2h. Wait, if L &lt; 2h, then (L/2)^2 &lt; h², so the maximum value of the product is less than h², hence all y satisfy the third condition.Therefore, if we cluster all points on each line within an interval of length less than 2h, then all pairs on each line have L &lt; 2h, hence all y between them satisfy the third condition, hence all such triples form acute triangles. Therefore, the total number is indeed (n - 1)n(n + 1)/3.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{41650}.Final Answerboxed{41650}&lt;/think&gt;Given two parallel lines (a) and (b) with 50 distinct points each, we need to find the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles formed by these points. To form an acute-angled triangle, we need three vertices such that all angles are less than 90 degrees. For two points on one line and one point on the other line, the configuration must satisfy certain geometric conditions. Key steps:1. Interleaving Points: Arrange the points on both lines such that they are interleaved. This maximizes the number of points on one line between any two points on the other line.2. Distance Condition: Ensure that the distance between any two points on the same line is less than twice the vertical distance (h) between the lines. This ensures that all resulting triangles are acute.3. Combinatorial Calculation: The number of acute triangles is calculated by considering pairs of points on each line and the points between them on the other line. This results in the formula (frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{3}) for each line, leading to the total number of acute triangles.For (n = 50):[text{Total number of acute triangles} = frac{(50-1) cdot 50 cdot (50+1)}{3} = frac{49 cdot 50 cdot 51}{3} = 41650]Thus, the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles is (boxed{41650}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8501f5e2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>🔑:</span>To find the greatest possible number of acute-angled triangles with vertices marked on two parallel lines (a) and (b), each containing 50 distinct points, we need to consider the geometric properties of such triangles.1. Label the Points:   Let (P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{50}) be the points on line (a) and (Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{50}) be the points on line (b).2. Forming Triangles:   Any triangle formed by these points will have one vertex on line (a) and two vertices on line (b), or vice versa. However, for the triangle to be acute-angled, the vertices must be chosen such that the angle between the lines joining the points is acute.3. Counting Acute Triangles:   To maximize the number of acute-angled triangles, we need to consider the arrangement of points. The key insight is that the number of acute-angled triangles is maximized when the points are interspersed in a specific manner.4. Using Symmetry and Combinatorics:   We can use combinatorial arguments to count the number of such triangles. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 100 (50 on each line) is given by the binomial coefficient:   [   binom{100}{3}   ]   However, not all of these triangles will be acute. We need to consider the specific arrangement that maximizes the number of acute triangles.5. Maximizing Acute Triangles:   By considering the arrangement where points are interspersed with some space between them, we can use the formula provided in the hints. The number of acute triangles is given by:   [   2 sum_{i=0}^{n} i(n-i)   ]   where (n = 50).6. Simplifying the Sum:   We need to evaluate the sum:   [   sum_{i=0}^{50} i(50-i)   ]   This can be simplified as:   [   sum_{i=0}^{50} (50i - i^2)   ]   Separating the sums, we get:   [   50 sum_{i=0}^{50} i - sum_{i=0}^{50} i^2   ]   Using the formulas for the sum of the first (n) integers and the sum of the squares of the first (n) integers:   [   sum_{i=0}^{50} i = frac{50 cdot 51}{2} = 1275   ]   [   sum_{i=0}^{50} i^2 = frac{50 cdot 51 cdot 101}{6} = 42925   ]   Substituting these values, we get:   [   50 cdot 1275 - 42925 = 63750 - 42925 = 20825   ]   Therefore, the number of acute triangles is:   [   2 cdot 20825 = 41650   ]7. Final Formula:   The formula provided in the hints simplifies to:   [   frac{n^3 - n}{3}   ]   Substituting (n = 50):   [   frac{50^3 - 50}{3} = frac{125000 - 50}{3} = frac{124950}{3} = 41650   ]The final answer is (boxed{41650}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-9aa12d53 data-v-8501f5e2><div class="review" data-v-8501f5e2><div class="review-title" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>❓:</span>Given that the even function f(x) satisfies the equation f(x+6) - f(x) = 2f(3) for any x in mathbb{R}, find the value of f(2019).</div><div class="divider" data-v-8501f5e2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of f(2019) for an even function f(x) that satisfies the equation f(x + 6) - f(x) = 2f(3) for any real number x. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what all this means.First, an even function means that f(-x) = f(x) for all x. So the graph is symmetric about the y-axis. That might come in handy later.Next, the functional equation: f(x + 6) - f(x) = 2f(3). This holds for any real number x. So, if I take any x, add 6 to it, evaluate the function at x+6, subtract the function at x, and the result is twice f(3). Interesting. So this suggests that the difference between f at x+6 and f at x is a constant, 2f(3). That makes me think of arithmetic sequences, where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Maybe f has a linear component?But f is even, so it can&#39;t just be a linear function unless it&#39;s a constant function. Wait, if f were linear, then f(x) = mx + b. But evenness would require f(-x) = -mx + b = mx + b, which implies that m = 0. So f would be a constant function. Let me check if that works.If f is constant, say f(x) = C for all x. Then f(x + 6) - f(x) = C - C = 0. So according to the equation, 0 = 2f(3) = 2C. That implies C = 0. So the only constant function solution is f(x) = 0. Then f(2019) would be 0. But is that the only solution? Maybe there are non-constant solutions as well.So maybe f is not constant. Let&#39;s think again. The functional equation is similar to a recurrence relation. For example, if we consider x as an integer, then f(x + 6) = f(x) + 2f(3), which is like a linear recurrence. But here x is any real number, not just integers. So the function has to satisfy this equation for all real x, which complicates things. But maybe the function is linear plus periodic? Or maybe it&#39;s a quadratic function?Wait, let&#39;s test quadratic functions. Suppose f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x + 6) = a(x + 6)² + b(x + 6) + c = a(x² + 12x + 36) + b(x + 6) + c = ax² + (12a + b)x + 36a + 6b + c. Then f(x + 6) - f(x) = [ax² + (12a + b)x + 36a + 6b + c] - [ax² + bx + c] = 12a x + 36a + 6b. According to the functional equation, this must equal 2f(3) = 2[a(9) + b(3) + c] = 18a + 6b + 2c. So we have 12a x + 36a + 6b = 18a + 6b + 2c. Let&#39;s rearrange terms. The left side is 12a x + (36a + 6b), the right side is (18a + 6b) + 2c. For these to be equal for all x, the coefficients of x must be zero, and the constants must be equal. So:12a = 0 ⇒ a = 0.Then, substituting a = 0 into the constants: 36a + 6b = 18a + 6b + 2c ⇒ 6b = 6b + 2c ⇒ 0 = 2c ⇒ c = 0.So the quadratic function would reduce to f(x) = bx. But since the function is even, f(-x) = -bx = bx ⇒ -bx = bx for all x, which implies b = 0. So again, the only solution is f(x) = 0. Hmm, so quadratic functions also only give the zero function.So maybe f is a periodic function? Let&#39;s see. If the difference f(x + 6) - f(x) is a constant, then perhaps f is linear plus periodic. Let&#39;s suppose f(x) = px + g(x), where g(x) is periodic with period 6. Then f(x + 6) = p(x + 6) + g(x + 6) = px + 6p + g(x). Then f(x + 6) - f(x) = 6p. According to the equation, this should equal 2f(3) = 2(p*3 + g(3)) = 6p + 2g(3). So 6p = 6p + 2g(3) ⇒ 2g(3) = 0 ⇒ g(3) = 0. But since g is periodic with period 6, g(3) = g(3 + 6k) for any integer k. But if we need g(3) = 0, then unless g is identically zero, this might not hold. Also, f must be even, so f(-x) = -px + g(-x) = px + g(x). Which would require that -px + g(-x) = px + g(x). So rearranging, g(-x) - g(x) = 2px. If g is periodic with period 6, then g(-x) = g(-x + 6k) for some integer k, but this seems complicated. Unless p = 0 and g is even. If p = 0, then f(x) = g(x), which is periodic and even. Then the equation becomes g(x + 6) - g(x) = 2g(3). But since g is periodic with period 6, g(x + 6) = g(x), so the equation becomes 0 = 2g(3) ⇒ g(3) = 0. So any even function with period 6 and g(3) = 0 would satisfy the equation. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify anything else about f, so unless there is more constraints, there might be multiple solutions. But the problem asks for the value of f(2019). If f is periodic with period 6, then f(2019) = f(2019 mod 6). Let&#39;s compute 2019 divided by 6. 6*336=2016, so 2019=6*336 +3, so 2019 mod6=3. Therefore, f(2019)=f(3). But from the functional equation, if we set x=3, then f(3 +6) - f(3)=2f(3). So f(9) - f(3)=2f(3) ⇒ f(9)=3f(3). But if f is periodic with period 6, then f(9)=f(3). Therefore, f(3)=3f(3) ⇒ 2f(3)=0 ⇒ f(3)=0. Hence, f(2019)=f(3)=0. So regardless of the function, if it&#39;s periodic with period 6 and even, and satisfies the equation, then f(2019)=0. However, earlier we saw that even a linear function forced f to be zero. Wait, but in the periodic case, we can have non-zero functions? Wait, if f is periodic with period 6, then f(x +6)=f(x). Then the equation becomes f(x) - f(x)=0=2f(3). Hence, f(3)=0. But even with that, f can be any even, periodic function with period 6 and f(3)=0. For example, f(x) = sin(πx/3), but that&#39;s odd. Wait, no, it needs to be even. So maybe f(x) = cos(πx/3) - cos(πx/3) at x=3? Wait, cos(π*3/3)=cos(π)= -1. So f(3)= -1. But we need f(3)=0. So maybe f(x)=cos(πx/3) +1. Then f(3)=cos(π)+1= -1 +1=0. Then f(x) is even, since cosine is even, and adding 1 keeps it even. Then f(x +6)=cos(π(x+6)/3) +1=cos(πx/3 + 2π) +1=cos(πx/3) +1=f(x). Then f(x+6)-f(x)=0=2f(3)=0, which works. So f(x)=cos(πx/3)+1 is such a function, and f(3)=0. Then f(2019)=f(3)=0. So indeed, even though the function isn&#39;t zero everywhere, f(2019) is zero. So perhaps regardless of the specific function, as long as it&#39;s even and satisfies the given equation, f(2019) must be zero.Alternatively, perhaps we can solve this without assuming periodicity. Let&#39;s try to find a general solution. Let&#39;s consider the functional equation f(x +6) = f(x) + 2f(3). Let&#39;s see if we can find a recursive relation here. For example, for any x, f(x +6) - f(x) =2f(3). Let&#39;s substitute x with x +6: f(x +12) - f(x +6) =2f(3). Then, adding these two equations: f(x +12) - f(x) =4f(3). Similarly, substituting x with x +12: f(x +18) - f(x +12)=2f(3), so f(x +18) - f(x)=6f(3). Continuing this, for any integer n, f(x +6n) - f(x)=2n f(3). Since 2019 = 6*336 + 3, so n=336. Therefore, f(2019) - f(3) =2*336*f(3). Therefore, f(2019)=f(3) + 672 f(3)=673 f(3).But we also know that f is even, so f(-x)=f(x). Let&#39;s try to find f(3). Maybe set x= -3 in the original equation. Then f(-3 +6) - f(-3)=2f(3). But f(-3 +6)=f(3), and f(-3)=f(3). So f(3) - f(3)=0=2f(3). Hence, 0=2f(3) ⇒ f(3)=0. Therefore, f(2019)=673*0=0.Oh, that&#39;s straightforward! So by substituting x=-3 into the functional equation, we can directly find that f(3)=0, and then using the relation f(x +6n)=f(x) +2n f(3), which gives f(2019)=f(3) +2*336*f(3)= (1 + 672)*0=0.Therefore, the answer is 0.Final Answerboxed{0}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the even function ( f(x) ) satisfies the equation ( f(x+6) - f(x) = 2f(3) ) for any ( x in mathbb{R} ), we need to find the value of ( f(2019) ).First, we note that ( f(x) ) is an even function, meaning ( f(-x) = f(x) ) for all ( x ). Next, we substitute ( x = -3 ) into the given functional equation:[f(-3 + 6) - f(-3) = 2f(3)]Since ( f ) is even, this simplifies to:[f(3) - f(3) = 2f(3) implies 0 = 2f(3) implies f(3) = 0]Now, we use the functional equation to express ( f(2019) ). Note that ( 2019 = 6 times 336 + 3 ). Using the relation ( f(x + 6n) = f(x) + 2n f(3) ), we substitute ( x = 3 ) and ( n = 336 ):[f(2019) = f(3 + 6 times 336) = f(3) + 2 times 336 times f(3)]Since ( f(3) = 0 ), this simplifies to:[f(2019) = 0 + 2 times 336 times 0 = 0]Thus, the value of ( f(2019) ) is (boxed{0}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the value of f(2019) given that f is an even function and it satisfies the equation f(x + 6) - f(x) = 2f(3) for any real number x. Hmm, alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, since f is even, that means f(-x) = f(x) for all x. So whatever properties we find for positive x will also apply to negative x. That might come in handy later.Now, the main equation given is f(x + 6) - f(x) = 2f(3). This is a functional equation that relates the value of the function at x + 6 to its value at x. It reminds me of a recurrence relation or a difference equation. Maybe we can solve it similarly by finding a general expression for f(x).Let&#39;s consider substituting different values of x into this equation to see if we can find a pattern or a relationship that can help us determine f(2019).First, let&#39;s try x = 0. Plugging that in:f(0 + 6) - f(0) = 2f(3)f(6) - f(0) = 2f(3)But since f is even, f(6) = f(-6). Not sure if that helps immediately, but let&#39;s note this equation: f(6) = f(0) + 2f(3). (1)Next, let&#39;s try x = 3:f(3 + 6) - f(3) = 2f(3)f(9) - f(3) = 2f(3)f(9) = 3f(3) (2)Similarly, x = 6:f(6 + 6) - f(6) = 2f(3)f(12) - f(6) = 2f(3)But from equation (1), f(6) = f(0) + 2f(3), so substituting:f(12) - (f(0) + 2f(3)) = 2f(3)f(12) = f(0) + 4f(3) (3)Continuing this pattern, maybe we can find a general formula for f(6k) where k is an integer.Wait, if we keep plugging x = 6, 12, 18, etc., each time we step up by 6, the function value increases by 2f(3). So for each increment of 6 in x, f(x + 6) = f(x) + 2f(3). That&#39;s a linear recurrence relation. If we think of x as a multiple of 6, say x = 6k, then f(6(k + 1)) = f(6k) + 2f(3). This suggests that f(6k) is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2f(3).So, starting from k=0: f(0) = f(0)k=1: f(6) = f(0) + 2f(3)k=2: f(12) = f(6) + 2f(3) = f(0) + 4f(3)k=3: f(18) = f(12) + 2f(3) = f(0) + 6f(3)And so on. So in general, f(6k) = f(0) + 2k f(3) for integer k.Similarly, if we consider x = 3, 9, 15, etc., we saw that f(9) = 3f(3). Let&#39;s check x = 9:f(9 + 6) - f(9) = 2f(3) =&gt; f(15) - f(9) = 2f(3) =&gt; f(15) = f(9) + 2f(3) = 3f(3) + 2f(3) = 5f(3)Similarly, x = 15: f(21) = 5f(3) + 2f(3) = 7f(3)So it seems that for x = 6k + 3, where k is an integer, f(6k + 3) = (2k + 1)f(3). For example, k=0: f(3) = 1f(3), k=1: f(9) = 3f(3), k=2: f(15) = 5f(3), etc.So, putting this together, maybe the function f has a periodic structure with period 6? Wait, but the differences are linear, not periodic. Wait, actually, the values at multiples of 6 are increasing linearly, and the values at 6k +3 are odd multiples of f(3). So perhaps f is linear in some transformed variable? Wait, but the function is even. So maybe there&#39;s a quadratic component?Alternatively, perhaps f(x) is a quadratic function? Let&#39;s assume that f(x) is quadratic. Let&#39;s try a quadratic function: f(x) = ax² + bx + c. But since it&#39;s even, f(-x) = f(x). So ax² - bx + c = ax² + bx + c. Therefore, -bx = bx for all x, which implies that b = 0. So f(x) must be of the form ax² + c.So f(x) is a quadratic function with no linear term. Let&#39;s try that. Let&#39;s assume f(x) = ax² + c. Then let&#39;s plug into the equation f(x +6) - f(x) = 2f(3).Compute f(x +6) - f(x):a(x +6)² + c - [ax² + c] = a[(x² +12x +36) - x²] = a(12x +36)So, 12a x + 36a = 2f(3). But the right-hand side is 2*(a*3² + c) = 2*(9a + c) = 18a + 2c.So we have 12a x + 36a = 18a + 2c for all x. Hmm, but this equation must hold for all x. However, the left side has a term with x, while the right side is constant. The only way this can be true is if the coefficient of x is zero and the constant terms are equal.Therefore:12a = 0 ⇒ a = 0Then substitute a =0 into the constant term:36a = 18a + 2c ⇒ 0 = 0 + 2c ⇒ c =0So the only quadratic function that satisfies this is f(x) =0. Then f(2019) =0. But is this the only solution?Wait, maybe f is not necessarily quadratic. The problem didn&#39;t specify that f is a polynomial. So assuming f is quadratic might be restrictive.Alternatively, maybe the general solution is a linear function plus a periodic function with period 6? Wait, let&#39;s think about the functional equation f(x +6) - f(x) = 2f(3). This is similar to a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.The homogeneous equation is f(x +6) - f(x) =0, so solutions are functions periodic with period 6. Then a particular solution can be a linear function, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.Suppose f(x) = mx + n. Then f(x +6) - f(x) = m(x +6) + n - (mx +n) =6m. So 6m = 2f(3). But f(3) =3m +n. Therefore, 6m = 2(3m +n) ⇒6m =6m +2n ⇒2n =0 ⇒n=0. So f(x) =mx.But then f(x) is linear, but since it&#39;s even, f(-x) = -mx = mx for all x. Therefore, m=0. So f(x)=0. Again, only the zero function. So similar to the quadratic case, assuming a linear function leads to f(x)=0.But the problem doesn&#39;t state that f is linear or quadratic. So maybe the only solution is the zero function? But let&#39;s check.Suppose f is non-zero. Let&#39;s see if such a function exists. Suppose f is a non-zero even function satisfying f(x +6) - f(x) =2f(3) for all x.But if f is non-zero, then the difference f(x+6) - f(x) is constant. So the function f has a constant difference over intervals of 6. This suggests that f is a linear function plus a periodic function with period 6. But since the difference is constant, the periodic function must have period 6, but also the linear part must satisfy the evenness condition.Wait, if f(x) = ax + p(x), where p(x) is periodic with period 6, then f(x +6) -f(x) = a(x +6) + p(x+6) - ax - p(x) =6a + [p(x+6) - p(x)] =6a +0 =6a. So 6a =2f(3) =2*(3a + p(3)). Therefore, 6a =6a +2p(3) ⇒2p(3)=0 ⇒p(3)=0.But since p is periodic with period 6, p(3)=p(3 -6)=p(-3). But f is even, so f(-3)=f(3). But f(-3)= -a*3 + p(-3) = -3a + p(-3). But f(-3)=f(3)=3a + p(3). Therefore:-3a + p(-3) =3a + p(3)But p(-3) =p(-3 +6)=p(3), since p has period 6. Therefore:-3a + p(3) =3a + p(3) ⇒-3a=3a ⇒6a=0 ⇒a=0.Therefore, f(x)=p(x), a periodic function with period 6. Then f(x+6) -f(x)=0=2f(3). Hence, 0=2f(3)⇒f(3)=0.But f is even and periodic with period 6, and f(3)=0. Then f(2019) can be calculated by noting that 2019 divided by 6 gives 336*6=2016, so 2019=6*336 +3. Therefore, f(2019)=f(3)=0.But in this case, the function could be any even periodic function with period 6 and f(3)=0. For example, f(x)=0 for all x, or f(x)=sin(πx/3) which is periodic with period 6, even, and sin(π*3/3)=sin(π)=0. So sin(πx/3) would satisfy the equation. However, let&#39;s check:If f(x) = sin(πx/3), which is indeed periodic with period 6, even function? Wait, sin(π(-x)/3) = -sin(πx/3), which is not equal to sin(πx/3) unless sin(πx/3)=0. So actually, sin(πx/3) is an odd function, not even. So that example doesn&#39;t work. Hmm.Wait, maybe cos(πx/3). Let&#39;s check: cos(πx/3) is even, since cosine is even. Let&#39;s check if it satisfies the functional equation. Compute f(x+6) - f(x) = cos(π(x+6)/3) - cos(πx/3) = cos(πx/3 + 2π) - cos(πx/3) = cos(πx/3) - cos(πx/3) =0. So this would satisfy f(x+6)-f(x)=0=2f(3). Then 0=2f(3), so f(3)=0. But cos(π*3/3)=cos(π)= -1 ≠0. So that doesn&#39;t work either.Wait, so maybe a non-zero function is not possible? Let&#39;s think. Suppose f is periodic with period 6, even, and f(3)=0. Then f(x+6) -f(x)=0=2f(3)=0, which holds. So such functions exist. For example, take f(x) =0 for all x, which is trivial. Another example: f(x) = cos(πx/3) -1. Then f(3)=cos(π) -1 = -1 -1 = -2≠0. Not good. How about f(x)=sin²(πx/6)? Let&#39;s check:f(-x)=sin²(-πx/6)=sin²(πx/6)=f(x), so even. Period: sin²(πx/6) has period 12, since sin(πx/6) has period 12. So period 12, which is larger than 6, so not suitable. Maybe another function.Alternatively, take f(x) =0 except at x=3, where f(3)=0. But that&#39;s trivial. Alternatively, a triangular wave with period 6 and symmetric (even), but with f(3)=0. But such a function would have f(3)=0, and even. But constructing it might be complicated. However, the key point is that the problem states &quot;the even function f(x)&quot; without any other conditions like continuity, differentiability, etc. So technically, there could be multiple solutions, but maybe in the problem&#39;s context, they expect the only solution is the zero function?Wait, but the problem says &quot;the even function f(x)&quot; satisfies the equation. So perhaps the problem is designed such that only the zero function works? Because otherwise, if multiple functions satisfy the conditions, then f(2019) could be different values. But since the problem asks to find the value of f(2019), it must be uniquely determined.Therefore, likely, the only solution is the zero function, so f(2019)=0.But how can we be sure?Let&#39;s recap. The functional equation is f(x +6) - f(x) =2f(3) for all x. If we can show that f(3) must be zero, then the equation becomes f(x +6)=f(x), so f is periodic with period 6. But also, since f is even, combining evenness with periodicity can lead to certain conclusions. However, if f(3)=0, then the functional equation becomes f(x +6)=f(x), so f is periodic with period 6. Then, since 2019 =6*336 +3, f(2019)=f(3)=0.But to show that f(3)=0, perhaps using the evenness and the functional equation.Let me try plugging x = -3 into the functional equation:f(-3 +6) - f(-3) =2f(3)Which simplifies to:f(3) - f(-3)=2f(3)But since f is even, f(-3)=f(3). Therefore:f(3) - f(3)=2f(3) ⇒0=2f(3)⇒f(3)=0.Ah! That&#39;s the key. Plugging x=-3 into the equation gives f(3) - f(-3) =2f(3). But because f is even, f(-3)=f(3), so substituting:f(3) - f(3) =2f(3) ⇒0=2f(3) ⇒f(3)=0.Therefore, f(3)=0. Then the functional equation simplifies to f(x +6) -f(x)=0 for all x, so f is periodic with period 6. Since f is even and periodic with period 6, f(2019)=f(6*336 +3)=f(3)=0.Therefore, the answer is 0.Final Answerboxed{0}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the even function ( f(x) ) satisfies the equation ( f(x+6) - f(x) = 2f(3) ) for any ( x in mathbb{R} ), we need to find the value of ( f(2019) ).First, we use the fact that ( f ) is an even function, meaning ( f(-x) = f(x) ) for all ( x ).Next, we substitute ( x = -3 ) into the given functional equation:[f(-3 + 6) - f(-3) = 2f(3)]Simplifying, we get:[f(3) - f(-3) = 2f(3)]Since ( f ) is even, ( f(-3) = f(3) ).

The complex number is given by z = (m² - 2m - 3) + (m² + 3m + 2)i. There are two parts to the problem: first, find the real numbers m such that z is a pure imaginary number; second, find the m such that the point z is in the second quadrant of the complex plane. Let me take this step by step.Starting with part (1): z is a pure imaginary number. From what I remember, a complex number is pure imaginary if its real part is zero and the imaginary part is non-zero. So, for z to be pure imaginary, the real part, which is (m² - 2m - 3), must equal zero, and the imaginary part, which is (m² + 3m + 2), must not equal zero. Got that. So, first, solve the equation m² - 2m - 3 = 0. Then, check the solutions to make sure that when plugged into the imaginary part, they don&#39;t result in zero. Let&#39;s do that.Solving m² - 2m - 3 = 0. This is a quadratic equation. Let me use the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0, so here a=1, b=-2, c=-3. The discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-2)² - 4*1*(-3) = 4 + 12 = 16. Square root of 16 is 4. So, solutions are m = [2 ± 4]/2. Therefore, m = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and m = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. So the solutions are m=3 and m=-1.But now, we need to make sure that the imaginary part isn&#39;t zero for these values. Let&#39;s check m=3 first. The imaginary part is m² + 3m + 2. Plugging m=3: 9 + 9 + 2 = 20. 20 is not zero. Good. Now m=-1: m² is 1, 3m is -3, so 1 -3 + 2 = 0. Oh, wait, that gives zero. So m=-1 makes the imaginary part zero. But we need the imaginary part to be non-zero. So m=-1 is invalid here. Therefore, only m=3 is a valid solution for part (1).Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for m=-1. The imaginary part is m² + 3m + 2. m=-1: (-1)^2 = 1, 3*(-1) = -3, plus 2. So 1 -3 + 2 = 0. Yep, that&#39;s correct. So indeed, when m=-1, the imaginary part is zero, which would make z=0i, but zero is considered a real number as well, but I think in the context of pure imaginary numbers, zero might not count? Wait, the problem says &quot;pure imaginary number&quot;. If the real part is zero and the imaginary part is zero, then it&#39;s zero, which technically is both real and imaginary. But I think in most cases, a pure imaginary number is defined as a number with zero real part and non-zero imaginary part. So z=0 would not be considered a pure imaginary number. Therefore, m=-1 is invalid, so the only solution is m=3.So for part (1), the answer is m=3.Moving on to part (2): the point corresponding to z is located in the second quadrant of the complex plane. The complex plane has quadrants similar to the Cartesian plane. The second quadrant is where the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. Therefore, for z to be in the second quadrant, both conditions must hold: the real part (m² - 2m - 3) &lt; 0, and the imaginary part (m² + 3m + 2) &gt; 0. So I need to solve these two inequalities.First, let me solve the real part inequality: m² - 2m - 3 &lt; 0.To solve this quadratic inequality, first find the roots of the quadratic equation m² - 2m - 3 = 0, which we already did earlier: m=3 and m=-1. Since the coefficient of m² is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic expression is negative between its roots. So the solution to m² - 2m - 3 &lt; 0 is m ∈ (-1, 3).Now, the imaginary part inequality: m² + 3m + 2 &gt; 0.Again, solve this quadratic inequality. First, find roots of m² + 3m + 2 = 0. Factoring: (m + 1)(m + 2) = 0, so roots at m = -1 and m = -2. The coefficient of m² is positive (1), so the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the quadratic expression is positive outside the interval between the roots. So m² + 3m + 2 &gt; 0 when m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1.So, the solution to the imaginary part inequality is m ∈ (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞).Now, the point z is in the second quadrant only when both conditions are satisfied: the real part is negative (so m ∈ (-1, 3)) and the imaginary part is positive (so m ∈ (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞)). So the intersection of these two intervals is the set of m that are in both (-1, 3) and (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞).Let me visualize this. The first interval is from -1 to 3. The second interval is everything less than -2 or greater than -1. The overlap between (-1,3) and (-∞, -2) is empty, since (-1,3) starts at -1 and (-∞, -2) ends at -2, which is less than -1. The overlap between (-1,3) and (-1, ∞) is (-1,3). Wait, but hold on: the second interval is (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞). So intersecting with (-1,3):The intersection is [(-1,3) ∩ (-∞, -2)] ∪ [(-1,3) ∩ (-1, ∞)]. The first intersection is empty, as noted. The second intersection is (-1,3) ∩ (-1, ∞) which is (-1,3). So the combined solution is (-1,3). But wait, but we have to remember that the imaginary part is positive when m ∈ (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞), and the real part is negative when m ∈ (-1, 3). Therefore, combining these two, m must be in (-1, 3) and also in (-∞, -2) or (-1, ∞). So m is in (-1,3) and (-1, ∞). Therefore, the intersection is (-1,3). But hold on, but when m is between -1 and 3, the real part is negative (good for second quadrant) and the imaginary part is positive when m is not between -2 and -1, but since m is already between -1 and 3, which is part of the region where m &gt; -1, so in that interval (-1,3), the imaginary part is positive. Wait, let me check that.Wait, the imaginary part inequality is m² + 3m + 2 &gt; 0. The solutions were m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1. Therefore, for m in (-1, ∞), which includes (-1,3), the imaginary part is positive. Therefore, if m is in (-1,3), then the imaginary part is positive (since m &gt; -1) and the real part is negative (since m is in (-1,3)). Therefore, the intersection is (-1,3). But wait, hold on, but when m is exactly -1, the imaginary part is zero, as we saw earlier. So m cannot be -1. Similarly, m=3 gives real part zero. So in the open interval (-1,3), both conditions are satisfied: real part negative and imaginary part positive.Wait, but let me verify with a test value. Let&#39;s pick m=0, which is in (-1,3). The real part is 0 -0 -3 = -3 &lt; 0. The imaginary part is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 &gt; 0. So that works. Let&#39;s pick m=2. Real part: 4 -4 -3 = -3 &lt; 0. Imaginary part: 4 +6 +2=12 &gt;0. Good. What about m=-0.5, which is between -1 and 0. Real part: (-0.5)^2 - 2*(-0.5) -3 = 0.25 +1 -3 = -1.75 &lt;0. Imaginary part: (-0.5)^2 +3*(-0.5) +2 =0.25 -1.5 +2=0.75&gt;0. So that&#39;s good. What about m approaching -1 from the right, say m=-0.9. Real part: (-0.9)^2 -2*(-0.9) -3=0.81 +1.8 -3= -0.39&lt;0. Imaginary part: (-0.9)^2 +3*(-0.9)+2=0.81 -2.7 +2=0.11&gt;0. So yes, approaching -1 from the right, it still works. Similarly, approaching 3 from the left, m=2.9. Real part: (2.9)^2 -2*(2.9) -3=8.41 -5.8 -3= -0.39&lt;0. Imaginary part: (2.9)^2 +3*(2.9)+2=8.41 +8.7 +2=19.11&gt;0. So indeed, the entire interval (-1,3) satisfies both conditions. However, we must check if there are any points in that interval where the imaginary part is not positive. But according to the solution of the inequality, m &gt; -1 gives imaginary part positive. Since (-1,3) is entirely in m &gt; -1, the imaginary part is positive throughout. So the answer for part (2) is m ∈ (-1,3). But since m is a real number, the values are all real numbers between -1 and 3, not including -1 and 3.But let me confirm once again. Suppose m=-2. Then, m is not in (-1,3), so we don&#39;t consider it. If m=-1.5, which is between -2 and -1, then real part would be m² -2m -3. Let&#39;s compute: (-1.5)^2 -2*(-1.5) -3=2.25 +3 -3=2.25&gt;0. So real part is positive here, which would not be in the second quadrant. So m=-1.5 is excluded, which is correct because m=-1.5 is not in (-1,3). Similarly, m=-2.5: real part would be positive, imaginary part is positive (since m &lt; -2), so that would be in the second quadrant? Wait, hold on. Wait, if m is in (-∞, -2), then the real part is m² -2m -3. Let&#39;s check m=-3. Then real part is 9 +6 -3=12&gt;0, and imaginary part is 9 -9 +2=2&gt;0. So for m &lt; -2, real part is positive and imaginary part is positive, which would place z in the first quadrant, not the second. So m &lt; -2 gives first quadrant. Therefore, only when m is between -1 and 3 is the real part negative and the imaginary part positive, putting z in the second quadrant. So my conclusion is correct. Therefore, the solution for part (2) is m ∈ (-1,3).Wait, but in the initial step, the imaginary part inequality solution was m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1. So for m &gt; -1, the imaginary part is positive. So in m ∈ (-1,3), which is part of m &gt; -1, the imaginary part is positive, and the real part is negative. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer for part (2) is all real numbers m such that -1 &lt; m &lt; 3.So summarizing:1) m = 32) -1 &lt; m &lt; 3But let me just check once again for part (2). Let&#39;s take m=-1. Not allowed, since it&#39;s excluded. If m=-1, real part is (-1)^2 -2*(-1) -3=1 +2 -3=0, and imaginary part is 0. So z=0, which is at the origin, not in any quadrant. Similarly, m=3, real part=0, imaginary part=20, which is on the positive imaginary axis, again not in any quadrant. So our open interval (-1,3) is correct for part (2).Therefore, the final answers should be:(1) boxed{3}(2) boxed{(-1, 3)}Final Answer(1) boxed{3}(2) boxed{(-1, 3)}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the given problem for the complex number ( z = (m^2 - 2m - 3) + (m^2 + 3m + 2)i ):1.

Final Answers1. (boxed{3})2. (boxed{(-1, 3)}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the real numbers m that satisfy two conditions for the complex number z = (m² - 2m - 3) + (m² + 3m + 2)i. First, when z is a pure imaginary number, and second, when the point corresponding to z is in the second quadrant of the complex plane. Let me start with part (1).For a complex number to be purely imaginary, its real part has to be zero, right? So the real part is (m² - 2m - 3). I need to set that equal to zero and solve for m.So, m² - 2m - 3 = 0. Let me factor this quadratic equation. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Let&#39;s see... The factors of -3 are 1 and -3. If I take 1 and -3, their sum is -2. Wait, yes: (m - 3)(m + 1) = 0. Because (m - 3)(m + 1) = m² + m - 3m - 3 = m² - 2m - 3. Perfect. So the solutions are m = 3 and m = -1.But wait, I need to check if the imaginary part is not zero when m is 3 or -1. Because if the imaginary part were zero too, then the number would be zero, which is technically both purely real and purely imaginary, but I think for the sake of problems like this, they want it to have a non-zero imaginary part. Let me confirm. The imaginary part is (m² + 3m + 2). Let&#39;s plug in m = 3: 3² + 3*3 + 2 = 9 + 9 + 2 = 20, which is not zero. For m = -1: (-1)² + 3*(-1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. Oh! So when m = -1, the imaginary part is zero. That means when m = -1, z is 0 + 0i, which is just zero. But zero is considered a purely real number and purely imaginary number? Hmm, the problem might consider zero as purely imaginary here. But maybe not. The problem says &quot;pure imaginary number,&quot; which sometimes is considered to have zero real part and non-zero imaginary part. So if m = -1 makes both parts zero, then z is zero, which might not be considered a pure imaginary number. Let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;z is a pure imaginary number.&quot; Depending on the definition, zero can be excluded. If so, then m = -1 would be invalid, leaving only m = 3. But the problem might accept zero. Let me think.Wait, maybe the problem is from a standard curriculum. In some contexts, pure imaginary numbers are numbers with zero real part and non-zero imaginary part. So if the imaginary part is zero, then it&#39;s not considered pure imaginary. Therefore, for m = -1, the imaginary part is zero, so z = 0, which is not a pure imaginary number. Therefore, m = -1 is invalid, so only m = 3. But I need to confirm that. Let me compute the imaginary part when m = -1: m² + 3m + 2. Plugging m = -1: 1 + (-3) + 2 = 0. So, yes, the imaginary part is zero. Therefore, z would be 0. So depending on the definition, but maybe the problem expects m = 3 and m = -1. Wait, but in my quadratic equation, both roots are m = 3 and m = -1. But m = -1 gives z = 0, which is not pure imaginary. Therefore, only m = 3 is valid. Hmm. Let me check if the problem mentions anything about z being non-zero. The problem just says &quot;pure imaginary number.&quot; If the definition allows zero, then both m = 3 and m = -1 are solutions. Otherwise, only m = 3. Hmm. The problem says &quot;pure imaginary number,&quot; which in mathematics sometimes includes zero, but sometimes not. Wait, in complex analysis, a purely imaginary number is a complex number whose real part is zero. So zero is included. Therefore, even if the imaginary part is zero, as long as the real part is zero, then it&#39;s purely imaginary. Wait, but if the imaginary part is also zero, then it&#39;s zero, which is both purely real and purely imaginary. So perhaps the problem allows that. Therefore, both m = 3 and m = -1. Wait, but when m = -1, z is 0. So maybe the problem expects both. Hmm. Let me check again.Original problem: &quot;Find the values of the real number m such that: (1) z is a pure imaginary number.&quot; If the problem allows z to be zero, then both m = 3 and m = -1. If it requires z to have a non-zero imaginary part, then only m = 3. Since the problem didn&#39;t specify non-zero, perhaps both are acceptable. However, in some contexts, pure imaginary numbers are defined as non-zero. Hmm. Let me check with the second part. Wait, part (2) is about being in the second quadrant, so maybe part (1) is straightforward. Let me see in part (2) they are considering quadrants, so they probably don&#39;t consider zero to be in any quadrant. So maybe part (1) requires the real part to be zero and the imaginary part to be non-zero, hence excluding m = -1. Therefore, the answer for (1) is m = 3.Wait, but I need to check this. Let me verify the imaginary part when m = 3. The imaginary part is m² + 3m + 2. Plugging m = 3: 9 + 9 + 2 = 20, which is 20i. So z = 0 + 20i, which is purely imaginary. For m = -1: z = 0 + 0i, which is zero. So depending on the definition. Let me check a reference. In mathematics, a purely imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as bi where b is a real number (and i is the imaginary unit). So if b = 0, then it&#39;s 0i = 0, which is purely imaginary? Wait, but 0 is also real. So zero is the only complex number that is both purely real and purely imaginary. Therefore, in some contexts, pure imaginary numbers are considered to be bi where b ≠ 0. Therefore, if the problem expects z to be purely imaginary and non-zero, then m = 3 is the only solution. If it allows zero, then both m = 3 and m = -1. Since the problem says &quot;pure imaginary number,&quot; without specifying non-zero, but in part (2) they mention the second quadrant, which is a region that doesn&#39;t include the axes or the origin. So maybe in part (1), they accept zero as a pure imaginary number, so both m = 3 and m = -1. Wait, but the problem is from a standard source. For example, in school textbooks, sometimes pure imaginary numbers are defined as non-zero. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that both roots are acceptable. Let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;the values of the real number m such that: (1) z is a pure imaginary number&quot;. So if pure imaginary includes zero, then both. If not, only m = 3. To resolve this, maybe I can check the answer. Wait, if m = -1, then z is 0. If the problem counts zero as a pure imaginary number, then both are answers, otherwise only m = 3. Since the problem is from an unknown source, but given the standard definition, perhaps they expect both. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed by someone who considers zero as a pure imaginary number, so the answers are m = 3 and m = -1. Hmm. Well, in many cases, zero is considered as a pure imaginary number because its real part is zero, so maybe both. Therefore, the answer for (1) is m = 3 and m = -1. Wait, but in the quadratic equation, we had m² - 2m - 3 = 0, which gave m = 3 and m = -1, so unless there&#39;s a restriction on the imaginary part, both are valid. Therefore, perhaps the answer is m = 3 and m = -1.But since when m = -1, z is 0, which is a real number as well. Hmm. So maybe the problem wants z to be purely imaginary and not real. Therefore, the answer is m = 3. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe in the problem&#39;s context, pure imaginary numbers are allowed to be zero. Therefore, maybe both solutions are correct. Wait, let&#39;s check some references. According to standard math definitions, a pure imaginary number is a complex number with real part equal to zero. So 0 is included. However, in some contexts, especially in education, problems might require the imaginary part to be non-zero. Since the problem is from an unknown source, but in the second part, they mention the second quadrant, which requires both the real and imaginary parts to have specific signs, so in the first part, maybe zero is acceptable. Therefore, m = 3 and m = -1. But let me confirm once again.Wait, if m = -1, then z = 0 + 0i. So is zero considered to be a pure imaginary number? In the definition, if pure imaginary numbers are numbers of the form bi where b is real, then zero is included because b can be zero. However, in some contexts, especially when distinguishing between real and imaginary numbers, zero is considered a real number, and pure imaginary numbers are required to have non-zero imaginary parts. Since the problem is about quadrants in part (2), which excludes the axes, but part (1) just says pure imaginary. If I look up standard definitions, for example, on Wikipedia: &quot;A purely imaginary number is a complex number whose real part is zero. It can be written as bi, where b is a real number and i is the imaginary unit.&quot; So according to that definition, zero is a purely imaginary number (when b = 0). Therefore, m = -1 is acceptable, as z = 0 + 0i is considered purely imaginary. Therefore, the answer for part (1) is m = 3 and m = -1. Wait, but that seems conflicting with some other sources. Wait, no. If a purely imaginary number is defined as a number with real part zero, regardless of the imaginary part, then z = 0 + 0i is purely imaginary. But in that case, it&#39;s also real. So the intersection of real and imaginary numbers is just zero. So if the problem is okay with that, then both m = 3 and m = -1 are solutions. If the problem requires z to be purely imaginary but not real, then only m = 3. But the problem didn&#39;t specify &quot;not real,&quot; so both are valid. Therefore, part (1) answer is m = 3 and m = -1. But I need to confirm once again.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that a pure imaginary number must have a non-zero imaginary part. So in that case, m must satisfy real part zero and imaginary part non-zero. Then, m = -1 would make the imaginary part zero, so it&#39;s excluded. Then only m = 3 is the answer. But how can I be sure? The problem is in Chinese maybe? Wait, no, the user wrote in English. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects both. But in that case, m = -1 leads to z = 0, which is on the origin. So maybe the problem expects pure imaginary numbers, even including zero. Hmm. Since the problem says &quot;pure imaginary number,&quot; and given that in standard math definitions zero is considered purely imaginary (and purely real), I think the answer is both m = 3 and m = -1.But now I need to check my work again. Let&#39;s recast:Problem (1): z is pure imaginary. So Re(z) = 0. Therefore, solve m² - 2m - 3 = 0, which gives m = 3 and m = -1. Then, for each m, check if z is purely imaginary. When m = 3: z = 0 + 20i, which is purely imaginary. When m = -1: z = 0 + 0i, which is zero. If zero is considered a pure imaginary number, then both are solutions. Otherwise, only m = 3. Since the problem says &quot;pure imaginary number,&quot; and in math, that can include zero, I think both are acceptable. Therefore, answer is m = 3 and m = -1.But now, let&#39;s check part (2). Maybe part (2) will help me see the problem&#39;s expectations. For part (2), the point is in the second quadrant. In the complex plane, the second quadrant corresponds to Re(z) &lt; 0 and Im(z) &gt; 0. So we need both real part negative and imaginary part positive. Therefore, set up inequalities:m² - 2m - 3 &lt; 0 (real part negative)andm² + 3m + 2 &gt; 0 (imaginary part positive)So we need to solve these two inequalities.First inequality: m² - 2m - 3 &lt; 0Factorizing m² - 2m - 3. Wait, we already factored this earlier as (m - 3)(m + 1). So (m - 3)(m + 1) &lt; 0. The roots are m = -1 and m = 3. The quadratic opens upwards, so the inequality is satisfied between the roots. So m ∈ (-1, 3).Second inequality: m² + 3m + 2 &gt; 0Factorizing m² + 3m + 2. Let&#39;s see, factors of 2 that add up to 3: 1 and 2. So (m + 1)(m + 2) &gt; 0. The roots are m = -2 and m = -1. The quadratic opens upwards, so the inequality is satisfied when m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1.Therefore, combining both inequalities: m must be in (-1, 3) and (m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1). The intersection of these is (-1, 3) intersected with (-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞) which is (-1, 3) ∩ [(-∞, -2) ∪ (-1, ∞)] = (-1, 3) ∩ (-1, ∞) = (-1, 3). Therefore, the solution is m ∈ (-1, 3).Wait, let me confirm. The first inequality is (-1, 3). The second inequality is m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1. So the intersection is the set of m that are in (-1, 3) and (m &lt; -2 or m &gt; -1). Since (-1, 3) and m &lt; -2 don&#39;t overlap, the intersection is only the part where m &gt; -1 and m &lt; 3. Therefore, the solution is (-1, 3). Wait, but m &gt; -1 from the second inequality and m &lt; 3 from the first. So yes, m ∈ (-1, 3).But wait, is that correct? Let&#39;s verify with a value in (-1, 3), say m = 0. Then real part: 0 - 0 -3 = -3 &lt; 0, imaginary part: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 &gt; 0. So z = -3 + 2i, which is in the second quadrant. Correct. Another value, m = 1: real part 1 -2 -3 = -4 &lt; 0, imaginary part 1 +3 +2 = 6 &gt;0. Correct. What about m = -0.5: real part (-0.5)^2 -2*(-0.5) -3 = 0.25 +1 -3 = -1.75 &lt;0, imaginary part (-0.5)^2 +3*(-0.5) +2 = 0.25 -1.5 +2 = 0.75 &gt;0. So in second quadrant. So the interval (-1, 3) is correct.But let me check m approaching -1 from the right: m = -0.999. Real part: (-0.999)^2 -2*(-0.999) -3 ≈ 1 - (-1.998) -3 ≈ 1 + 1.998 -3 ≈ -0.002 &lt;0. Imaginary part: (-0.999)^2 + 3*(-0.999) +2 ≈ 1 - 2.997 +2 ≈ 0.003 &gt;0. So yes, it&#39;s still in the second quadrant.At m = -1: real part is 0, imaginary part is 0. So on the origin. Not in any quadrant.At m = 3: real part is 0, imaginary part is 20. On the positive imaginary axis, not in any quadrant.So the solution for part (2) is m ∈ (-1, 3). Therefore, m is greater than -1 and less than 3.But wait, let me check if the problem says &quot;located in the second quadrant&quot;. In the complex plane, quadrants don&#39;t include the axes, so the real and imaginary parts must be non-zero. Therefore, in addition to Re(z) &lt; 0 and Im(z) &gt; 0, we must have Re(z) ≠ 0 and Im(z) ≠ 0. Therefore, m must not make Re(z) = 0 or Im(z) = 0. So in addition to m ∈ (-1, 3), we need to exclude m where Re(z) =0 (i.e., m =3 or m=-1) and Im(z)=0 (i.e., m = -1 or m = -2). But since m ∈ (-1, 3), the points where Im(z) =0 would be m = -1 and m = -2. But m ∈ (-1,3) excludes m = -1 and m = -2. Therefore, the solution remains m ∈ (-1,3). So no need for additional constraints. Therefore, part (2) answer is -1 &lt; m &lt; 3.Therefore, summarizing:1) m = 3 and m = -1.But earlier I thought m = -1 gives z =0, which might not be considered pure imaginary. But according to the definition, if pure imaginary includes zero, then both. However, the problem might have intended only m=3. Hmm.But given that part (2) requires the point to be in the second quadrant, which requires Re(z) &lt;0 and Im(z) &gt;0, so not including the axes. Therefore, maybe part (1) is only requiring Re(z) =0, but not necessarily excluding Im(z)=0. So perhaps the problem accepts both. Therefore, the answers are:1) m = 3 and m = -1.2) -1 &lt; m &lt; 3.But let&#39;s verify with the problem&#39;s possible source. Since in part (1), the answer is m =3 and m =-1, but for part (2), m must be between -1 and 3, so m =-1 is excluded. Therefore, if part (1) includes m =-1, but part (2) doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s acceptable. So I think in part (1), m can be 3 or -1, even if in part (2) m has to be between -1 and 3. Therefore, the answers are separate.Therefore, the final answers are:(1) m = -1 and m =3.(2) -1 &lt;m &lt;3.But let me check for part (1). When m =-1, z =0 +0i. If the problem considers zero as a pure imaginary number, then yes. But if not, only m=3. Since the problem is about complex numbers, and in complex plane, zero is at the origin, which is not in any quadrant. So for part (1), depending on the problem&#39;s definition.Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where pure imaginary numbers are defined as non-zero. Then the answer for part (1) is m=3. However, given that part (2) solution is between -1 and 3, which is close to the previous.Wait, given that part (2) is in the second quadrant, which requires real part negative and imaginary part positive, which is separate.But let&#39;s think again. In part (1), solving m² - 2m -3 =0 gives m=3 and m=-1. When m=3, z=0 +20i, which is purely imaginary. When m=-1, z=0 +0i, which is zero. If zero is considered a pure imaginary number, then both. But if not, only m=3. Since definitions can vary, but given that in part (2) they consider quadrants, which exclude the axes, maybe in part (1) zero is acceptable. Therefore, the answer is m=3 and m=-1.Alternatively, the problem might consider that a pure imaginary number must have a non-zero imaginary part, so m=-1 is excluded. Therefore, only m=3. To resolve this ambiguity, maybe check the problem&#39;s source or standard answers. But since I don&#39;t have that, I need to go with the standard mathematical definition. According to standard math, a purely imaginary number is any complex number with real part zero, which includes zero. Therefore, both m=3 and m=-1. Therefore, the answer is m=3 and m=-1 for part (1).But let me check with another source. For example, Paul&#39;s Online Math Notes says: &quot;A complex number is purely imaginary if it has zero real part.&quot; So 0 is included. Therefore, both m=3 and m=-1. So the answer for part (1) is m=3 and m=-1.Therefore, the answers are:1) m = -1 and m =3.2) -1 &lt;m &lt;3.Hence, boxed answers:(1) boxed{-1} and boxed{3}(2) boxed{(-1, 3)}But the problem says &quot;values of the real number m&quot;, so for part (1) multiple answers, for part (2) an interval. Depending on how the problem wants the answer. If they want separate boxed answers:For (1): boxed{-1} and boxed{3}For (2): boxed{(-1, 3)}But in some contexts, interval for (2) can be written as m ∈ (-1, 3), but the problem might just want the values, so writing the interval.Alternatively, if the problem expects combined answers:(1) m = boxed{-1} and m = boxed{3}(2) All real numbers m with boxed{-1 &lt; m &lt; 3}Alternatively, using interval notation for (2): boxed{(-1, 3)}Yes, that&#39;s standard.Therefore, the final answers are:1) boxed{-1} and boxed{3}2) boxed{(-1, 3)}But checking again, in part (1), maybe the problem expects the answer as a set, so written as boxed{-1} and boxed{3}, whereas part (2) is an interval. So that&#39;s how I should present it.Final Answer(1) The values of ( m ) are (boxed{-1}) and (boxed{3}).(2) The values of ( m ) are in the interval (boxed{(-1, 3)}).&lt;/think&gt;To determine the values of the real number ( m ) such that the complex number ( z = (m^2 - 2m - 3) + (m^2 + 3m + 2)i ) satisfies the given conditions:1. ( z ) is a pure imaginary number:   - A complex number is pure imaginary if its real part is zero.   - Set the real part equal to zero: ( m^2 - 2m - 3 = 0 ).   - Solving the quadratic equation: ( (m - 3)(m + 1) = 0 ), which gives ( m = 3 ) or ( m = -1 ).   - Check the imaginary part for these values:     - For ( m = 3 ), the imaginary part is ( 3^2 + 3 cdot 3 + 2 = 20 neq 0 ).     - For ( m = -1 ), the imaginary part is ( (-1)^2 + 3 cdot (-1) + 2 = 0 ).   - By standard definition, zero is considered a pure imaginary number. Therefore, both ( m = 3 ) and ( m = -1 ) are solutions.2. The point corresponding to ( z ) is in the second quadrant:   - The second quadrant requires the real part to be negative and the imaginary part to be positive.   - Solve the inequalities:     - Real part: ( m^2 - 2m - 3 &lt; 0 ). Factoring gives ( (m - 3)(m + 1) &lt; 0 ), leading to ( -1 &lt; m &lt; 3 ).     - Imaginary part: ( m^2 + 3m + 2 &gt; 0 ). Factoring gives ( (m + 1)(m + 2) &gt; 0 ), leading to ( m &lt; -2 ) or ( m &gt; -1 ).   - Intersection of the solutions: ( -1 &lt; m &lt; 3 ). Final Answers1. The values of ( m ) are (boxed{-1}) and (boxed{3}).2.

Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling how entries in Pascal&#39;s Triangle work. Each row n has entries corresponding to the binomial coefficients C(n, 0), C(n, 1), ..., C(n, n). Each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. The problem says three consecutive entries in some row have the ratio 3:4:5. Let me denote these three consecutive entries as C(n, k-1), C(n, k), and C(n, k+1). According to the problem, their ratios should be 3:4:5. So, we can write the ratios as:C(n, k) / C(n, k-1) = 4/3,andC(n, k+1) / C(n, k) = 5/4.I need to find integers n and k such that these ratios hold. Remember that the entries in Pascal&#39;s Triangle are integers, so these ratios must simplify to fractions that result in integers when multiplied by the previous entry. So, starting with the first ratio:C(n, k) / C(n, k-1) = (n! / (k!(n - k)!)) / (n! / ((k - 1)!(n - k + 1)!))) = ((k - 1)!(n - k + 1)! ) / (k!(n - k)!)) = (n - k + 1)/k = 4/3.So, (n - k + 1)/k = 4/3. Let&#39;s solve this equation for n in terms of k.Cross-multiplying, we get 3(n - k + 1) = 4k.Expanding that: 3n - 3k + 3 = 4k.Bring all terms to one side: 3n + 3 = 7k.So, 3(n + 1) = 7k. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 3, and (n + 1) must be a multiple of 7. Let me note that down: k = 3m, and n + 1 = 7m, where m is a positive integer. Therefore, n = 7m - 1 and k = 3m.Similarly, let&#39;s look at the second ratio:C(n, k+1)/C(n, k) = 5/4.Again, using the formula for the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients:C(n, k+1)/C(n, k) = (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.So, (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.Cross-multiplying: 4(n - k) = 5(k + 1).Expanding: 4n - 4k = 5k + 5.Bring all terms to one side: 4n - 9k - 5 = 0.So, 4n = 9k + 5.But from the previous equation, we have n = 7m - 1 and k = 3m. Let&#39;s substitute n and k in terms of m into this equation.Substitute n = 7m -1 and k = 3m into 4n = 9k +5:4*(7m -1) = 9*(3m) +528m -4 = 27m +5Subtract 27m from both sides: m -4 =5Therefore, m =9.So, m=9. Then, n =7m -1=7*9 -1=63 -1=62, and k=3m=27.Therefore, the row is n=62, which is row 62.Wait, let me check if this works. Let&#39;s verify the ratios.First, compute C(62, 26), C(62,27), C(62,28) and check their ratios.But computing these coefficients directly would be time-consuming. Instead, let&#39;s use the ratios.From the first ratio, C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = (n - k +1)/k. With n=62 and k=27, this becomes (62 -27 +1)/27=(36)/27=4/3, which is correct.Similarly, the second ratio C(n, k+1)/C(n, k)=(n -k)/(k +1). So, (62 -27)/28=35/28=5/4, which matches. Therefore, the three consecutive entries C(62,26), C(62,27), C(62,28) have ratios 3:4:5.But wait, let&#39;s make sure that the entries themselves are in the ratio 3:4:5. The problem states that three consecutive entries are in the ratio 3:4:5. So, C(n, k-1):C(n, k):C(n, k+1)=3:4:5. So, if C(n, k)/C(n, k-1)=4/3, then C(n, k-1) must be a multiple of 3, C(n, k) a multiple of 4, and C(n, k+1) a multiple of 5. But given that these are binomial coefficients, they are integers. So, the ratios would need to hold when simplified. However, in our case, since the ratios between consecutive terms are 4/3 and 5/4, the three terms would be in the ratio 3:4:5. Let&#39;s see:Suppose C(n, k-1) = 3x, then C(n, k) = 4x, and C(n, k+1) =5x. Then, the ratio between the first and second is 4x/3x=4/3, which matches the first ratio, and between the second and third is 5x/4x=5/4, which matches the second ratio. Therefore, as long as the ratios of consecutive terms are 4/3 and 5/4, the three terms will be in the ratio 3:4:5.So, according to the equations we solved, this occurs when m=9, which gives n=62. Therefore, the answer should be row 62.But let me verify with actual numbers. Let&#39;s compute C(62,26), C(62,27), and C(62,28).But calculating these directly is going to be tedious. However, perhaps we can compute the ratios again using the formula.C(62,27)/C(62,26) = (62 -26)/27 = 36/27 = 4/3. So, if C(62,26) is 3x, then C(62,27) is 4x.Similarly, C(62,28)/C(62,27) = (62 -27)/28 =35/28=5/4. So, if C(62,27) is 4x, then C(62,28) is 5x. Therefore, the three entries are 3x, 4x, 5x, so their ratio is 3:4:5. Therefore, this satisfies the condition.Therefore, row 62 is the answer.Wait, but let me check if there could be a smaller row that satisfies this. For example, maybe m=1 gives n=6, k=3. Let&#39;s check.If m=1, then n=7*1 -1=6, k=3*1=3. Let&#39;s check row 6. The entries are 1,6,15,20,15,6,1. So, the entries in positions 3,4,5 (0-indexed) are 20,15,6. Wait, no. Wait, row 6 is [1,6,15,20,15,6,1]. So, entries are C(6,0)=1, C(6,1)=6, C(6,2)=15, C(6,3)=20, C(6,4)=15, C(6,5)=6, C(6,6)=1.If k=3, then the entries would be C(6,2)=15, C(6,3)=20, C(6,4)=15. The ratio 15:20:15 simplifies to 3:4:3, which is not 3:4:5. So, that&#39;s not the case. Hence, m=1 does not work.Similarly, m=2: n=13, k=6. Let&#39;s check row 13. Hmm, but row 13 is a bit long. Let me check the ratios.C(13,5)/C(13,4)= (13-4)/5=9/5=1.8, which is 9/5, not 4/3. Wait, no, maybe I messed up.Wait, if n=13 and k=6, then C(13,6)/C(13,5)= (13-5)/6=8/6=4/3. So, the ratio is 4/3. Then, C(13,7)/C(13,6)= (13-6)/7=7/7=1. Which is not 5/4. Therefore, the next ratio is 1, which doesn&#39;t fit. So, m=2 doesn&#39;t work either.Similarly, m=3: n=20, k=9. Let&#39;s check:C(20,9)/C(20,8)= (20-8)/9=12/9=4/3. Then, C(20,10)/C(20,9)= (20-9)/10=11/10. Which is 11/10, not 5/4. So, that doesn&#39;t work either.So, m=9 gives n=62, which works. Let&#39;s confirm with m=9:n=62, k=27.C(62,27)/C(62,26)= (62-26)/27=36/27=4/3.C(62,28)/C(62,27)= (62-27)/28=35/28=5/4. Perfect.Therefore, the three consecutive entries are C(62,26):C(62,27):C(62,28)=3x:4x:5x for some x. Therefore, their ratio is 3:4:5.Hence, the answer is row 62.Final AnswerThe three consecutive entries in the ratio (3:4:5) occur in row (boxed{62}).&lt;/think&gt;To determine the row in Pascal&#39;s Triangle where three consecutive entries occur in the ratio (3:4:5), we start by considering the binomial coefficients (C(n, k-1)), (C(n, k)), and (C(n, k+1)). We need these coefficients to satisfy the ratios (C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = 4/3) and (C(n, k+1)/C(n, k) = 5/4).First, we use the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients:[frac{C(n, k)}{C(n, k-1)} = frac{n - k + 1}{k} = frac{4}{3}]Solving for (n), we get:[3(n - k + 1) = 4k implies 3n + 3 = 7k implies 3(n + 1) = 7k]This implies (k = 3m) and (n + 1 = 7m) for some integer (m), leading to (n = 7m - 1) and (k = 3m).Next, we use the second ratio:[frac{C(n, k+1)}{C(n, k)} = frac{n - k}{k + 1} = frac{5}{4}]Substituting (n = 7m - 1) and (k = 3m) into this equation, we get:[frac{(7m - 1 - 3m)}{3m + 1} = frac{5}{4} implies frac{4m - 1}{3m + 1} = frac{5}{4}]Cross-multiplying and solving for (m):[4(4m - 1) = 5(3m + 1) implies 16m - 4 = 15m + 5 implies m = 9]Substituting (m = 9) back into the expressions for (n) and (k), we find:[n = 7(9) - 1 = 62 quad text{and} quad k = 3(9) = 27]Verifying the ratios with (n = 62) and (k = 27):[frac{C(62, 27)}{C(62, 26)} = frac{36}{27} = frac{4}{3} quad text{and} quad frac{C(62, 28)}{C(62, 27)} = frac{35}{28} = frac{5}{4}]Thus, the three consecutive entries (C(62, 26)), (C(62, 27)), and (C(62, 28)) are in the ratio (3:4:5). Therefore, the row is (boxed{62}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out in which row of Pascal&#39;s Triangle there are three consecutive entries in the ratio 3:4:5. Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling how Pascal&#39;s Triangle works. Each row n has entries corresponding to the binomial coefficients C(n, 0), C(n, 1), ..., C(n, n). Each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. The problem is asking for three consecutive numbers in some row such that their ratio is 3:4:5. Let&#39;s denote these three consecutive entries as C(n, k-1), C(n, k), and C(n, k+1). According to the problem, the ratios between these should be 3:4:5. So, mathematically, that would mean:C(n, k)/C(n, k-1) = 4/3andC(n, k+1)/C(n, k) = 5/4.Alternatively, we can set up equations based on the ratio between consecutive binomial coefficients. I remember that the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients C(n, k) and C(n, k-1) is equal to (n - k + 1)/k. Let me verify that formula. Yes, because C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n - k)!] and C(n, k-1) = n! / [(k-1)!(n - k + 1)!]. So the ratio would be [n! / (k!(n - k)!))] / [n! / ((k-1)!(n - k + 1)!))] = [(k-1)!(n - k + 1)!)] / [k!(n - k)!)] = (n - k + 1)/k. So that ratio is indeed (n - k + 1)/k. Therefore, setting up the first ratio:(n - k + 1)/k = 4/3.Similarly, the next ratio between C(n, k+1) and C(n, k) would be (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4.So now we have two equations:1) (n - k + 1)/k = 4/32) (n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4Our goal is to solve these two equations for integers n and k, since row numbers and positions in Pascal&#39;s Triangle are integers. Let me write these equations again:From equation 1:(n - k + 1)/k = 4/3Multiply both sides by k:n - k + 1 = (4/3)kBring all terms to one side:n + 1 = (4/3)k + k = (7/3)kTherefore, equation 1 becomes:n + 1 = (7/3)kSimilarly, equation 2:(n - k)/(k + 1) = 5/4Multiply both sides by (k + 1):n - k = (5/4)(k + 1)So:n = (5/4)(k + 1) + k = (5/4)k + 5/4 + k = (9/4)k + 5/4Therefore, equation 2 gives:n = (9/4)k + 5/4So now we have two expressions for n:From equation 1: n = (7/3)k - 1From equation 2: n = (9/4)k + 5/4So set them equal to each other:(7/3)k - 1 = (9/4)k + 5/4Let&#39;s solve for k. To eliminate fractions, multiply both sides by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4):12*(7/3)k - 12*1 = 12*(9/4)k + 12*(5/4)Simplify each term:12*(7/3)k = 4*7 k = 28k12*1 = 1212*(9/4)k = 3*9 k = 27k12*(5/4) = 3*5 = 15So the equation becomes:28k - 12 = 27k + 15Subtract 27k from both sides:k - 12 = 15Add 12 to both sides:k = 27Now that we have k = 27, plug back into one of the expressions for n. Let&#39;s use equation 1:n + 1 = (7/3)kSo:n = (7/3)*27 - 1 = 7*9 - 1 = 63 - 1 = 62Alternatively, using equation 2:n = (9/4)*27 + 5/4 = (243/4) + (5/4) = 248/4 = 62Same result. So n = 62, k = 27.Therefore, the row is row 62, and the three consecutive entries are C(62, 26), C(62, 27), and C(62, 28). Wait, hold on, if k is 27, then the three consecutive entries would be C(n, k-1), C(n, k), C(n, k+1). So that&#39;s k-1 = 26, k =27, k+1=28. So in row 62, entries 26, 27, 28.But we need to verify that these entries actually exist. Since row n has entries from 0 to n, so for n=62, entries go from 0 to 62. So 26,27,28 are within that range. So that&#39;s okay.But let&#39;s check if the ratios are indeed 3:4:5. Let&#39;s compute the ratios between consecutive entries.First, C(62,27)/C(62,26) should be 4/3. Let&#39;s compute that ratio.C(62,27) / C(62,26) = (62 - 27 + 1)/27 = (36)/27 = 4/3. Correct.Similarly, C(62,28)/C(62,27) = (62 - 28 + 1)/28 = (35)/28 = 5/4. Correct.Therefore, the three consecutive entries in row 62, positions 26,27,28, have ratios 4/3 and 5/4, so overall ratio 3:4:5 when scaled appropriately.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If C(62,26) : C(62,27) : C(62,28) is 3:4:5, then the ratios between the first and second is 4/3, and between the second and third is 5/4, which is exactly what we found. But the problem states that the three consecutive entries are in the ratio 3:4:5. So if we let C(62,26) = 3x, C(62,27) = 4x, and C(62,28) =5x, then the ratios would hold. However, binomial coefficients are integers, so 3x, 4x, and 5x must all be integers, which implies that x is a rational number such that 3x, 4x, 5x are integers. But since binomial coefficients are integers, x must be a fraction with denominator dividing 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple of 3,4,5 is 60, so x can be a multiple of 1/60. However, since binomial coefficients are integers, 3x must be integer, so x must be a multiple of 1/3; 4x must be integer, so x must be a multiple of 1/4; and 5x must be integer, so x must be a multiple of 1/5. Therefore, x must be a multiple of 1/(lcm(3,4,5)) = 1/60. So x = k/60 for some integer k. Therefore, 3x = k/20, 4x = k/15, 5x = k/12 must all be integers. Hence, k must be a multiple of 60. Therefore, x is integer. Wait, no. Wait, x = k/60, so 3x = k/20. For 3x to be integer, k must be divisible by 20. Similarly, 4x = k/15 must be integer, so k must be divisible by 15. 5x = k/12 must be integer, so k must be divisible by 12. Therefore, k must be a multiple of lcm(20,15,12). Let&#39;s compute that. Prime factors: 20=2^2*5, 15=3*5, 12=2^2*3. LCM is 2^2*3*5=60. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 60. Hence, x = 60/60 =1, or 120/60=2, etc. Therefore, x is integer. Therefore, 3x, 4x, 5x are integers, which is consistent with the binomial coefficients being integers. Therefore, as long as the ratios hold, the actual coefficients would be multiples of 3,4,5. Therefore, our answer of row 62 is correct.But let me check with actual numbers to be absolutely sure. Let&#39;s compute C(62,26), C(62,27), C(62,28).But computing such large binomial coefficients might be tedious. Alternatively, let&#39;s compute their ratios and confirm.C(62,27) = C(62,26) * (62 -26)/27 = C(62,26) * 36/27 = C(62,26) * 4/3. So if C(62,26) is 3x, then C(62,27) is 4x. Then, C(62,28) = C(62,27) * (62 -27)/28 = C(62,27) * 35/28 = C(62,27) * 5/4. So if C(62,27) is 4x, then C(62,28) is 5x. Therefore, the three entries are 3x, 4x, 5x. Therefore, their ratio is 3:4:5. Thus, this works. Therefore, the answer is row 62.But to be thorough, maybe there&#39;s a smaller row? Wait, the equations gave us a unique solution n=62 and k=27. Since these equations are linear and we solved them correctly, there&#39;s only one solution. Therefore, row 62 is the only row where such a ratio occurs.Therefore, the answer is row 62, which would be boxed as boxed{62}.Final Answerboxed{62}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the row in Pascal&#39;s Triangle where three consecutive entries occur in the ratio (3:4:5), we start by considering the binomial coefficients (C(n, k-1)), (C(n, k)), and (C(n, k+1)). The ratios between these coefficients should be (3:4:5), leading to the following equations:1. (frac{C(n, k)}{C(n, k-1)} = frac{4}{3})2. (frac{C(n, k+1)}{C(n, k)} = frac{5}{4})Using the ratio of consecutive binomial coefficients, (frac{C(n, k)}{C(n, k-1)} = frac{n - k + 1}{k}) and (frac{C(n, k+1)}{C(n, k)} = frac{n - k}{k + 1}), we set up the equations:1. (frac{n - k + 1}{k} = frac{4}{3})2. (frac{n - k}{k + 1} = frac{5}{4})Solving the first equation:[frac{n - k + 1}{k} = frac{4}{3} implies 3(n - k + 1) = 4k implies 3n - 3k + 3 = 4k implies 3n + 3 = 7k implies n + 1 = frac{7}{3}k]Solving the second equation:[frac{n - k}{k + 1} = frac{5}{4} implies 4(n - k) = 5(k + 1) implies 4n - 4k = 5k + 5 implies 4n = 9k + 5 implies n = frac{9}{4}k + frac{5}{4}]Equating the two expressions for (n):[frac{7}{3}k - 1 = frac{9}{4}k + frac{5}{4}]Multiplying through by 12 to clear the fractions:[28k - 12 = 27k + 15 implies k = 27]Substituting (k = 27) back into the expression for (n):[n = frac{7}{3} times 27 - 1 = 63 - 1 = 62]Thus, the three consecutive entries (C(62, 26)), (C(62, 27)), and (C(62, 28)) in row 62 have the ratio (3:4:5).

The answer choices are A through D, with numbers like 1, 45/7, 20/3, and 9. Hmm, okay. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.First, since there are two equations and three variables, it seems like we might need to express two variables in terms of the third and then substitute them into the expression we need to minimize. Alternatively, maybe using methods from linear algebra or optimization, like Lagrange multipliers? Wait, but this is a problem likely intended for high school level, so maybe it&#39;s simpler.Let me start by solving the system of equations for a and b in terms of c. Then, substitute those expressions into ( a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2 ) and find the minimum value by treating it as a quadratic in c. That sounds feasible.So the two equations are:1. ( 2a + b - 5c = 5 )2. ( 2a - b - 3c = -1 )If I add these two equations together, the b terms will cancel out. Let&#39;s try that:Adding equation 1 and equation 2:( (2a + b - 5c) + (2a - b - 3c) = 5 + (-1) )Simplify left side:( 4a - 8c = 4 )Divide both sides by 4:( a - 2c = 1 )Therefore, ( a = 1 + 2c ). Okay, so we&#39;ve expressed a in terms of c.Now, let&#39;s subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a. Wait, but since both equations have 2a, maybe subtracting isn&#39;t the best. Alternatively, let&#39;s substitute the value of a into one of the equations to find b.Let me take equation 1: ( 2a + b - 5c = 5 ). Substitute ( a = 1 + 2c ):( 2(1 + 2c) + b - 5c = 5 )Expand:( 2 + 4c + b - 5c = 5 )Simplify:( 2 - c + b = 5 )So, ( b = 5 - 2 + c )Which is ( b = 3 + c ). Okay, so b is also expressed in terms of c.So now, both a and b are expressed in terms of c. Therefore, the expression ( a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2 ) can be rewritten entirely in terms of c.Let me do that:Given ( a = 1 + 2c ) and ( b = 3 + c ), substitute into the expression:( (1 + 2c)^2 + (3 + c)^2 + 2c^2 )Let me expand each term:First term: ( (1 + 2c)^2 = 1 + 4c + 4c^2 )Second term: ( (3 + c)^2 = 9 + 6c + c^2 )Third term: ( 2c^2 )Now, add all these together:( (1 + 4c + 4c^2) + (9 + 6c + c^2) + 2c^2 )Combine like terms:Constants: 1 + 9 = 10c terms: 4c + 6c = 10cc² terms: 4c² + c² + 2c² = 7c²So the entire expression simplifies to:( 7c² + 10c + 10 )Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function ( f(c) = 7c² + 10c + 10 ).Since this is a quadratic in c with a positive coefficient on c², the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum is at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ( ax² + bx + c ) is at ( x = -b/(2a) ). So here, a = 7, b = 10.Therefore, the minimum occurs at:( c = -10/(2*7) = -10/14 = -5/7 )Now, substitute c = -5/7 back into the expression for f(c):( f(-5/7) = 7*(-5/7)^2 + 10*(-5/7) + 10 )Calculate each term step by step.First term: ( 7*(25/49) = (7*25)/49 = 175/49 = 25/7 )Second term: ( 10*(-5/7) = -50/7 )Third term: 10 = 70/7So adding them all together:25/7 - 50/7 + 70/7 = (25 - 50 + 70)/7 = (45)/7 ≈ 6.42857So the minimum value is 45/7, which is option B.Wait, but let me verify if I did all calculations correctly. Let me check each step.First, solving the system of equations:1. 2a + b -5c =52. 2a -b -3c =-1Adding equations: 4a -8c =4 =&gt; a -2c=1 =&gt; a=1 +2c. Correct.Then substituting into equation1: 2(1 +2c) + b -5c=5. 2 +4c +b -5c=5 =&gt; 2 -c +b=5 =&gt; b=5 -2 +c=3 +c. Correct.So a=1+2c, b=3+c. Then substituting into the expression:(1+2c)^2 + (3 +c)^2 +2c^2. Let&#39;s expand again.(1 +4c +4c²) + (9 +6c +c²) +2c².So 1 +9=10, 4c +6c=10c, 4c² +c² +2c²=7c². So total is 7c² +10c +10. Correct.Then vertex at c= -10/(2*7)= -5/7. Correct.Then substituting back:7*(-5/7)^2 +10*(-5/7) +10First term: 7*(25/49)=25/7.Second term: -50/7.Third term:10=70/7.Total:25/7 -50/7 +70/7=45/7. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So 45/7 is the minimum value, which is option B.Alternatively, just to ensure that there isn&#39;t a different approach which might lead to another answer, but this seems solid. Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers, but that&#39;s more complicated and should give the same result.Alternatively, think of this as finding the minimum distance squared from the origin (but with a weight on c) subject to the two linear constraints. But since we have two equations, the solution is the intersection line of the two planes, and we need the minimum value of a^2 +b^2 +2c^2 along that line. But solving by substitution as done above is straightforward and leads to 45/7, which is option B. So I think that&#39;s the right answer.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations (2a + b - 5c = 5) and (2a - b - 3c = -1), we need to find the minimum value of (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2).First, we solve the system of equations for (a) and (b) in terms of (c):1. Adding the two equations:   [   (2a + b - 5c) + (2a - b - 3c) = 5 + (-1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   4a - 8c = 4 implies a - 2c = 1 implies a = 1 + 2c   ]2. Substituting (a = 1 + 2c) into the first equation:   [   2(1 + 2c) + b - 5c = 5   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2 + 4c + b - 5c = 5 implies 2 - c + b = 5 implies b = 3 + c   ]Now, substitute (a = 1 + 2c) and (b = 3 + c) into the expression (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2):[(1 + 2c)^2 + (3 + c)^2 + 2c^2]Expanding and combining like terms:[(1 + 4c + 4c^2) + (9 + 6c + c^2) + 2c^2 = 10 + 10c + 7c^2]This simplifies to the quadratic function (7c^2 + 10c + 10). The minimum value of a quadratic function (ax^2 + bx + c) occurs at (x = -frac{b}{2a}):[c = -frac{10}{2 cdot 7} = -frac{5}{7}]Substituting (c = -frac{5}{7}) back into the quadratic function:[7left(-frac{5}{7}right)^2 + 10left(-frac{5}{7}right) + 10]Calculating each term:[7 cdot frac{25}{49} = frac{175}{49} = frac{25}{7}][10 cdot left(-frac{5}{7}right) = -frac{50}{7}][10 = frac{70}{7}]Adding these together:[frac{25}{7} - frac{50}{7} + frac{70}{7} = frac{45}{7}]Thus, the minimum value of (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2) is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two equations with three variables: 2a + b - 5c = 5 and 2a - b - 3c = -1. We need to find the minimum value of the expression a² + b² + 2c². The answer choices are given, so maybe after solving, I can check which one it matches. Let me start by writing down what&#39;s given.First, the two equations:1. 2a + b - 5c = 52. 2a - b - 3c = -1Since there are three variables (a, b, c) but only two equations, it seems like we&#39;ll have infinitely many solutions, and we need to find the one that minimizes a² + b² + 2c². Hmm, this feels like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use substitution to express a and b in terms of c, then substitute into the expression to minimize it. Let me try that approach.Let me label the equations for clarity.Equation (1): 2a + b = 5c + 5Equation (2): 2a - b = 3c - 1If I add these two equations together, maybe the b terms will cancel. Let&#39;s check:Adding Equation (1) and Equation (2):(2a + b) + (2a - b) = (5c + 5) + (3c - 1)Left side: 4aRight side: 8c + 4So, 4a = 8c + 4Divide both sides by 4:a = 2c + 1Okay, that gives a in terms of c. Now, let&#39;s subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate a.Wait, actually, since we have a expressed in terms of c, maybe we can substitute that back into one of the equations to find b in terms of c. Let&#39;s try that.Using a = 2c + 1, substitute into Equation (1):2*(2c + 1) + b - 5c = 5Compute 2*(2c + 1): 4c + 2So, equation becomes: 4c + 2 + b - 5c = 5Combine like terms: (4c - 5c) + 2 + b = 5 → -c + 2 + b = 5Then, solving for b:b = 5 + c - 2 → b = c + 3So now, we have both a and b in terms of c:a = 2c + 1b = c + 3Great! So now, all variables are expressed in terms of c. Therefore, we can substitute these into the expression we need to minimize: a² + b² + 2c².Let me compute each term step by step.First, a²:a = 2c + 1 → a² = (2c + 1)² = 4c² + 4c + 1Next, b²:b = c + 3 → b² = (c + 3)² = c² + 6c + 9Then, 2c² remains as is: 2c²Now, add them all together:a² + b² + 2c² = (4c² + 4c + 1) + (c² + 6c + 9) + 2c²Combine like terms:4c² + c² + 2c² = 7c²4c + 6c = 10c1 + 9 = 10So the expression simplifies to:7c² + 10c + 10Now, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of the quadratic function 7c² + 10c + 10.Since the coefficient of c² is positive (7), the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum occurs at the vertex. The formula for the vertex (minimum) of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = 7, b = 10.So, c = -10/(2*7) = -10/14 = -5/7So, the value of c that minimizes the expression is c = -5/7.Now, let&#39;s compute the minimum value by plugging c = -5/7 into 7c² + 10c + 10.First, compute c²:(-5/7)² = 25/49So, 7c² = 7*(25/49) = 25/710c = 10*(-5/7) = -50/710 is just 10 = 70/7 (to have a common denominator)So adding them all together:25/7 - 50/7 + 70/7 = (25 - 50 + 70)/7 = 45/7 ≈ 6.42857Looking at the answer choices, option B is 45/7. So that must be the correct answer. Let me verify once again to ensure I didn&#39;t make any calculation errors.First, solving for a and b in terms of c:From equations 1 and 2:Adding equations: 4a = 8c + 4 → a = 2c + 1. Correct.Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: (2a + b) - (2a - b) = (5c + 5) - (3c - 1)Which gives 2b = 2c + 6 → b = c + 3. Correct.Expressing a² + b² + 2c²:a = 2c +1: squared is 4c² +4c +1b = c +3: squared is c² +6c +9Adding 2c² gives total: 4c² +4c +1 + c² +6c +9 +2c² = 7c² +10c +10. Correct.Then, finding the vertex at c = -10/(2*7) = -5/7. Correct.Calculating the value: 7*(25/49) +10*(-5/7) +10 = 25/7 -50/7 +70/7 = 45/7. Yes, that&#39;s right. So 45/7 is the minimal value. So the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations (2a + b - 5c = 5) and (2a - b - 3c = -1), we need to find the minimum value of (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2).First, we solve the system of equations for (a) and (b) in terms of (c):1. Adding the two equations:   [   (2a + b) + (2a - b) = (5c + 5) + (3c - 1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   4a = 8c + 4 implies a = 2c + 1   ]2. Subtracting the second equation from the first:   [   (2a + b) - (2a - b) = (5c + 5) - (3c - 1)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2b = 2c + 6 implies b = c + 3   ]Next, we substitute (a = 2c + 1) and (b = c + 3) into the expression (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2):[a^2 = (2c + 1)^2 = 4c^2 + 4c + 1][b^2 = (c + 3)^2 = c^2 + 6c + 9][a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2 = (4c^2 + 4c + 1) + (c^2 + 6c + 9) + 2c^2][= 7c^2 + 10c + 10]To find the minimum value of the quadratic function (7c^2 + 10c + 10), we use the vertex formula (c = -frac{b}{2a}) where (a = 7) and (b = 10):[c = -frac{10}{2 cdot 7} = -frac{5}{7}]Substituting (c = -frac{5}{7}) back into the quadratic function:[7left(-frac{5}{7}right)^2 + 10left(-frac{5}{7}right) + 10][= 7 left(frac{25}{49}right) - frac{50}{7} + 10][= frac{25}{7} - frac{50}{7} + frac{70}{7}][= frac{45}{7}]Thus, the minimum value of (a^2 + b^2 + 2c^2) is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8501f5e2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>🔑:</span>Answer: B</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-9aa12d53 data-v-8501f5e2><div class="review" data-v-8501f5e2><div class="review-title" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>❓:</span>Given a complex number z = x + yi (x, y in mathbb{R}, x neq 0) and |z - 2| = sqrt{3}, find the maximum value of frac{y}{x}.</div><div class="divider" data-v-8501f5e2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the maximum value of y/x for a complex number z = x + yi where |z - 2| = sqrt(3). Hmm, so z is a complex number, which can be represented as a point (x, y) in the plane. The condition |z - 2| = sqrt(3) means that the distance from the point (x, y) to the point (2, 0) is sqrt(3). So this is a circle with center at (2, 0) and radius sqrt(3). And I need to find the maximum value of y/x. That&#39;s the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x, y). So, essentially, among all the points (x, y) on that circle, what&#39;s the maximum slope of the line connecting the origin to that point.Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. The circle is centered at (2, 0) with radius sqrt(3) (~1.732). The origin is at (0, 0). So the circle is to the right of the origin, centered at (2, 0). The radius is less than the distance from the center to the origin (which is 2), so the circle doesn&#39;t include the origin. Therefore, the origin is outside the circle.I need to find lines through the origin that are tangent to the circle, and the slopes of these tangent lines will give the maximum and minimum values of y/x. Since the maximum slope would be the steepest tangent line above the x-axis, and the minimum would be the steepest downward. But since the problem asks for the maximum value, I just need the upper tangent.Alternatively, maybe using calculus or some geometric approach. Let me think of different methods.First, parametrizing the circle. The equation |z - 2| = sqrt(3) translates to (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3. So that&#39;s the equation of the circle. Then, we can parametrize this circle with trigonometric functions. Let&#39;s set x - 2 = sqrt(3) cos theta and y = sqrt(3) sin theta. Then x = 2 + sqrt(3) cos theta, y = sqrt(3) sin theta. Then y/x is [sqrt(3) sin theta]/[2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]. Then, we can consider this as a function f(theta) = [sqrt(3) sin theta]/[2 + sqrt(3) cos theta], and we need to find its maximum value.Alternatively, maybe using calculus here. Take derivative with respect to theta and set to zero. Let me try that.Let f(theta) = [sqrt(3) sin theta] / [2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]. Let’s compute f’(theta):Using the quotient rule: f’(theta) = [sqrt(3) cos theta (2 + sqrt(3) cos theta) - sqrt(3) sin theta (-sqrt(3) sin theta)] / [2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]^2Simplify numerator:sqrt(3) cos theta (2 + sqrt(3) cos theta) + 3 sin^2 thetaExpand first term: 2 sqrt(3) cos theta + 3 cos^2 thetaSo numerator becomes: 2 sqrt(3) cos theta + 3 cos^2 theta + 3 sin^2 thetaBut 3 cos^2 theta + 3 sin^2 theta = 3 (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) = 3So numerator is 2 sqrt(3) cos theta + 3Therefore, f’(theta) = [2 sqrt(3) cos theta + 3] / [2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]^2Set numerator equal to zero: 2 sqrt(3) cos theta + 3 = 0Solving for cos theta: cos theta = -3 / (2 sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(3)/2Therefore, theta = 150 degrees or 5pi/6 radians, or 210 degrees or 7pi/6 radians. But since cosine is negative, theta is in second or third quadrant.But let&#39;s check which ones correspond to maximum.So, when cos theta = -sqrt(3)/2, then sin theta is either 1/2 or -1/2. So theta = 150 degrees (sin positive) or 210 degrees (sin negative). Since we are looking for the maximum y/x, which would be positive, so theta = 150 degrees.Therefore, at theta = 5pi/6, let&#39;s compute y/x:sin theta = sin 5pi/6 = 1/2cos theta = cos 5pi/6 = -sqrt(3)/2So y = sqrt(3) * 1/2 = sqrt(3)/2x = 2 + sqrt(3) * (-sqrt(3)/2) = 2 - (3/2) = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5So y/x = (sqrt(3)/2) / (1/2) = sqrt(3). Hmm, but sqrt(3) is about 1.732.Wait, but let me check if that&#39;s actually the maximum.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a higher value. Wait, but according to the derivative, this is when the slope is stationary. So since the denominator is squared, the sign of the derivative depends on the numerator.So when cos theta &gt; -3/(2 sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(3)/2 ~ -0.866, the numerator is positive, so function is increasing; when cos theta &lt; -sqrt(3)/2, numerator is negative, function is decreasing.Therefore, the critical point at cos theta = -sqrt(3)/2 is a maximum. So y/x reaches maximum at theta = 5pi/6, giving sqrt(3). Wait, but let&#39;s check another approach to confirm.Alternatively, the problem can be considered as a circle (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3 and find the line y = m x that is tangent to this circle. The maximum slope m is the desired value.The condition for the line y = m x to be tangent to the circle is that the distance from the center (2, 0) to the line is equal to the radius sqrt(3).The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).The line y = m x can be rewritten as m x - y = 0. So a = m, b = -1, c = 0.Distance from (2, 0) to the line is |m*2 - 1*0 + 0| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |2 m| / sqrt(m^2 + 1)This distance should equal sqrt(3). Therefore:|2 m| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = sqrt(3)Squaring both sides:4 m^2 / (m^2 + 1) = 3Multiply both sides by (m^2 + 1):4 m^2 = 3 m^2 + 3Subtract 3 m^2: m^2 = 3Therefore, m = sqrt(3) or m = -sqrt(3)Since the problem asks for the maximum value of y/x, which is the maximum slope, so sqrt(3) is the answer.Wait, so both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(3). But in the first method, when I computed y/x at theta = 5pi/6, I also got sqrt(3). So that seems consistent.But let me check with another point. Suppose theta = 90 degrees (pi/2). Then x = 2 + sqrt(3)*0 = 2, y = sqrt(3)*1 = sqrt(3). So y/x = sqrt(3)/2 ~0.866. Which is less than sqrt(3). Similarly, at theta approaching 180 degrees, x approaches 2 - sqrt(3) ~0.267, y approaches 0. So y/x approaches 0. But as theta goes to 150 degrees, x is 0.5, y is sqrt(3)/2, so y/x is sqrt(3). So that seems to be the maximum.Alternatively, if I consider the tangent line from the origin to the circle. The distance from the origin to the center is 2 units, and the radius is sqrt(3). So the angle between the line connecting the origin to the center (which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (2,0)) and the tangent line can be found using Pythagoras.The tangent lines from a point outside the circle form a right triangle with the radius and the distance from the point to the center. So the length of the tangent from the origin to the circle is sqrt(distance^2 - radius^2) = sqrt(2^2 - (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(4 - 3) = 1. So the length of the tangent is 1.But how does this relate to the slope? Hmm. If the tangent length is 1, then the tangent points are at distance 1 from the origin. Wait, but the circle is centered at (2,0) with radius sqrt(3). The tangent from the origin to this circle would touch the circle at some point, and the distance from the origin to that point is the tangent length, which is sqrt( (distance from origin to center)^2 - radius^2 ) = sqrt(4 - 3) = 1. So the points of tangency are at distance 1 from the origin. Therefore, the tangent lines from the origin to the circle touch the circle at points that are 1 unit away from the origin.Wait, but how can we use this? If we know that the tangent points are at distance 1 from the origin, then we can set up equations:(x)^2 + y^2 = 1 (since distance from origin is 1)and (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3 (since they lie on the circle)Subtracting the first equation from the second:(x - 2)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 3 - 1 =&gt; (x^2 -4x +4) - x^2 = 2 =&gt; -4x +4 = 2 =&gt; -4x = -2 =&gt; x = 0.5Therefore, the points of tangency have x-coordinate 0.5. Then substituting back into x^2 + y^2 = 1:(0.5)^2 + y^2 = 1 =&gt; 0.25 + y^2 =1 =&gt; y^2 = 0.75 =&gt; y = sqrt(3)/2 or -sqrt(3)/2.Therefore, the points are (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) and (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). So the slopes y/x are (sqrt(3)/2)/0.5 = sqrt(3) and (-sqrt(3)/2)/0.5 = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(3).This confirms the previous results. Therefore, regardless of the method used, the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3).Just to recap, the problem required finding the maximum slope of the line from the origin to a point on the circle centered at (2,0) with radius sqrt(3). By using different methods—parametrization and calculus, the tangent line distance formula, and geometric intersections—we arrived at the same result of sqrt(3). So I feel confident that sqrt(3) is the correct answer.Final AnswerThe maximum value of (frac{y}{x}) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given a complex number ( z = x + yi ) where ( |z - 2| = sqrt{3} ), we need to find the maximum value of ( frac{y}{x} ).1. Geometric Interpretation:   - The equation ( |z - 2| = sqrt{3} ) represents a circle centered at ( (2, 0) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ).   - We need to find the maximum slope ( frac{y}{x} ) of the line from the origin to a point on this circle.2. Parametrization:   - Parametrize the circle: ( x - 2 = sqrt{3} cos theta ) and ( y = sqrt{3} sin theta ).   - Express ( frac{y}{x} ) as ( frac{sqrt{3} sin theta}{2 + sqrt{3} cos theta} ).3. Calculus Approach:   - Differentiate the function ( f(theta) = frac{sqrt{3} sin theta}{2 + sqrt{3} cos theta} ).   - Find the critical points by setting the derivative to zero, leading to ( cos theta = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).   - Corresponding ( theta = frac{5pi}{6} ) gives ( sin theta = frac{1}{2} ), yielding ( x = 0.5 ) and ( y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).   - Slope ( frac{y}{x} = sqrt{3} ).4. Tangent Line Distance:   - The line ( y = mx ) tangent to the circle must be at a distance ( sqrt{3} ) from the center ( (2, 0) ).   - Solve for ( m ) using the distance formula, resulting in ( m = pm sqrt{3} ).   - Maximum slope is ( sqrt{3} ).5. Geometric Intersection:   - Points of tangency from the origin to the circle are found to be ( (0.5, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) ) and ( (0.5, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) ).   - Maximum slope is ( sqrt{3} ).Thus, the maximum value of ( frac{y}{x} ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: Given a complex number z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and x is not zero. The condition given is that the modulus of z minus 2 is equal to the square root of 3. I need to find the maximum value of y over x, which is basically the slope of the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y) in the complex plane. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall that the modulus of a complex number z - a, where a is another complex number, represents the distance from the point z to the point a in the complex plane. So in this case, |z - 2| = sqrt(3) means that the distance from z to the point (2, 0) is sqrt(3). So geometrically, this is a circle with center at (2, 0) and radius sqrt(3). The problem then reduces to finding the maximum slope of the lines from the origin to points (x, y) on this circle. Since x is not zero, we don&#39;t have to worry about division by zero, which is good.So, to rephrase: Find the maximum value of y/x where (x, y) lies on the circle centered at (2, 0) with radius sqrt(3). Let me write down the equation of this circle. The standard equation for a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. Here, h is 2, k is 0, and r is sqrt(3). So the equation is (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3. That&#39;s the constraint.Now, I need to maximize y/x under this constraint. There are a few ways to approach optimization problems with constraints. One common method is using calculus, specifically Lagrange multipliers, but since this is a circle and we&#39;re dealing with slopes, maybe there&#39;s a geometric interpretation that could simplify things. Let me think about both approaches.First, the geometric approach. The slope y/x is maximized when the line from the origin to (x, y) is tangent to the circle. Because the tangent line would have the maximum slope just touching the circle. So, if I can find the equations of the tangent lines from the origin to the circle and then determine their slopes, the maximum slope would be the answer. That sounds promising. Let&#39;s try this.To find the tangent lines from a point (in this case, the origin) to a circle, there is a formula. The distance from the point to the center of the circle is D, then the angle theta between the line connecting the point to the center and the tangent lines can be found using sin(theta) = r / D, where r is the radius of the circle. Let me verify that.Wait, the distance from the origin to the center of the circle (2, 0) is 2 units. The radius of the circle is sqrt(3). So, the distance from the origin to the center is 2, which is greater than the radius sqrt(3) (approximately 1.732). Therefore, the origin is outside the circle, which means there are two tangent lines from the origin to the circle. The slopes of these tangent lines will give the maximum and minimum values of y/x.The formula for the angle theta is sin(theta) = r / D, where D is the distance from the external point to the center, and theta is the angle between the line connecting the external point to the center and the tangent lines. So here, sin(theta) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, theta is arcsin(sqrt(3)/2) which is 60 degrees or pi/3 radians. Therefore, the angles of the tangent lines with respect to the x-axis would be the angle of the line connecting the origin to the center (which is along the x-axis, since the center is at (2,0)) plus and minus theta. Since the center is along the positive x-axis, adding and subtracting 60 degrees from 0 degrees gives angles of 60 degrees and -60 degrees. Therefore, the slopes of the tangent lines would be tan(60 degrees) and tan(-60 degrees), which are sqrt(3) and -sqrt(3). So the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3). Wait, but let me check if that&#39;s accurate.Wait, perhaps I oversimplified. The formula sin(theta) = r/D gives theta, but is the angle between the line connecting the external point to the center and the tangent line. So the actual angles of the tangent lines with respect to the x-axis might not just be theta. Let me think again. Let me draw a diagram mentally. The center is at (2,0), the origin is at (0,0). The distance between them is 2. The radius of the circle is sqrt(3). So, from the origin, we can draw two tangent lines to the circle.The angle between the line connecting the origin to the center (which is along the x-axis) and each tangent line is theta, where sin(theta) = r/D = sqrt(3)/2. So theta is 60 degrees. Therefore, the tangent lines make angles of 60 degrees above and below the x-axis. Therefore, their slopes are tan(60 degrees) and tan(-60 degrees), which are sqrt(3) and -sqrt(3). Therefore, the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3). Is this correct? Let me verify with another method.Alternatively, using coordinate geometry, let&#39;s set up the problem. Let&#39;s suppose the tangent line from the origin to the circle (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3 has slope m. The equation of the tangent line is y = m x. The condition for this line to be tangent to the circle is that the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius.The distance from a point (h, k) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |a h + b k + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). In our case, the line is y = m x, which can be rewritten as m x - y = 0. The center of the circle is (2, 0). So the distance from (2, 0) to the line m x - y = 0 is |m*2 - 0 + 0| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |2 m| / sqrt(m^2 + 1). This distance must equal the radius sqrt(3). Therefore:|2 m| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = sqrt(3)Squaring both sides:(4 m^2) / (m^2 + 1) = 3Multiply both sides by (m^2 + 1):4 m^2 = 3(m^2 + 1)Expand:4 m^2 = 3 m^2 + 3Subtract 3 m^2 from both sides:m^2 = 3Therefore, m = sqrt(3) or m = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3). So this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(3).But let me also try solving it using calculus to double-check. Let&#39;s set up the problem using Lagrange multipliers. We need to maximize f(x, y) = y/x subject to the constraint g(x, y) = (x - 2)^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0.The Lagrangian is L = y/x + λ[(x - 2)^2 + y^2 - 3]. Taking partial derivatives:Partial derivative with respect to x: (-y)/x^2 + λ*2(x - 2) = 0Partial derivative with respect to y: 1/x + λ*2 y = 0Partial derivative with respect to λ: (x - 2)^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0So we have three equations:1. (-y)/x^2 + 2 λ (x - 2) = 02. 1/x + 2 λ y = 03. (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3Let me try to solve these equations. From equation 2, we can solve for λ:1/x + 2 λ y = 0 =&gt; 2 λ y = -1/x =&gt; λ = -1/(2 x y)Substitute λ into equation 1:(-y)/x^2 + 2*(-1/(2 x y))*(x - 2) = 0Simplify:(-y)/x^2 - (x - 2)/(x y) = 0Multiply both sides by x^2 y to eliminate denominators:(-y^2) - (x - 2) x = 0So:- y^2 - x(x - 2) = 0 =&gt; - y^2 - x^2 + 2 x = 0 =&gt; - (x^2 + y^2) + 2 x = 0 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 2 xBut from the constraint equation (equation 3):(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3 =&gt; x^2 - 4 x + 4 + y^2 = 3 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 - 4 x + 4 = 3 =&gt; x^2 + y^2 = 4 x - 1But from the previous result, x^2 + y^2 = 2 x. Therefore:2 x = 4 x - 1 =&gt; -2 x = -1 =&gt; x = 1/2So x = 1/2. Now substitute back into x^2 + y^2 = 2 x:(1/2)^2 + y^2 = 2*(1/2) =&gt; 1/4 + y^2 = 1 =&gt; y^2 = 3/4 =&gt; y = sqrt(3)/2 or y = -sqrt(3)/2Therefore, the critical points are (1/2, sqrt(3)/2) and (1/2, -sqrt(3)/2). Now, compute y/x for these points:For (1/2, sqrt(3)/2): (sqrt(3)/2) / (1/2) = sqrt(3)For (1/2, -sqrt(3)/2): (-sqrt(3)/2) / (1/2) = -sqrt(3)Therefore, the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3), which matches our previous results.Alternatively, another method using parametric equations. Let&#39;s parameterize the circle. Since the circle is centered at (2, 0) with radius sqrt(3), we can write:x = 2 + sqrt(3) cos thetay = 0 + sqrt(3) sin thetaTherefore, any point on the circle can be expressed as (2 + sqrt(3) cos theta, sqrt(3) sin theta). Then, the slope y/x is [sqrt(3) sin theta] / [2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]. We need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to theta.Let me denote m(theta) = [sqrt(3) sin theta] / [2 + sqrt(3) cos theta]. To find its maximum, take derivative with respect to theta and set to zero. Let&#39;s compute dm/d theta.Let me denote numerator = sqrt(3) sin theta, denominator = 2 + sqrt(3) cos theta.Using the quotient rule: dm/d theta = [sqrt(3) cos theta * denominator - numerator * (-sqrt(3) sin theta)] / denominator^2Compute numerator of the derivative:sqrt(3) cos theta * (2 + sqrt(3) cos theta) + sqrt(3) sin theta * sqrt(3) sin thetaSimplify:sqrt(3)*2 cos theta + sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) cos^2 theta + 3 sin^2 thetasqrt(3)*2 cos theta + 3 cos^2 theta + 3 sin^2 thetaNote that 3 cos^2 theta + 3 sin^2 theta = 3(cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) = 3So the entire expression becomes:sqrt(3)*2 cos theta + 3Therefore, dm/d theta = [sqrt(3)*2 cos theta + 3] / denominator^2Set derivative equal to zero:sqrt(3)*2 cos theta + 3 = 0Solve for cos theta:2 sqrt(3) cos theta = -3cos theta = -3 / (2 sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(3)/2Therefore, theta = 150 degrees or 210 degrees (since cos theta = -sqrt(3)/2 at these angles). Let&#39;s check theta = 150 degrees (5 pi / 6 radians):x = 2 + sqrt(3) cos(150°) = 2 + sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = 2 - (3/2) = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5y = sqrt(3) sin(150°) = sqrt(3)*(1/2) = sqrt(3)/2So y/x = (sqrt(3)/2) / 0.5 = sqrt(3)/2 / (1/2) = sqrt(3). Similarly, for theta = 210 degrees (7 pi / 6 radians):x = 2 + sqrt(3) cos(210°) = 2 + sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3)/2) = same as above, 0.5y = sqrt(3) sin(210°) = sqrt(3)*(-1/2) = -sqrt(3)/2So y/x = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt(3), which is consistent.So all three methods—geometric interpretation using tangent lines, Lagrange multipliers, and parametric differentiation—give the same result. Therefore, I&#39;m confident that the maximum value of y/x is sqrt(3).Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing that |z - 2| = sqrt(3) represents a circle, then realizing that maximizing y/x is equivalent to finding the tangent line from the origin to this circle with the highest slope. All approaches lead to the conclusion that the maximum slope is sqrt(3). Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(3).Final AnswerThe maximum value of (frac{y}{x}) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given a complex number ( z = x + yi ) where ( x, y in mathbb{R} ) and ( x neq 0 ), we know that ( |z - 2| = sqrt{3} ). This condition describes a circle centered at ( (2, 0) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ). We need to find the maximum value of ( frac{y}{x} ).1. Geometric Interpretation:   - The equation ( |z - 2| = sqrt{3} ) translates to the circle ((x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3).   - The maximum value of ( frac{y}{x} ) is the slope of the tangent line from the origin to this circle.   - The distance from the origin to the center of the circle (2, 0) is 2. The radius of the circle is ( sqrt{3} ).   - Using the formula for the tangent lines from an external point to a circle, the angle ( theta ) is given by ( sin(theta) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), leading to ( theta = 60^circ ).   - The slopes of the tangent lines are ( tan(60^circ) = sqrt{3} ) and ( tan(-60^circ) = -sqrt{3} ). The maximum value is ( sqrt{3} ).2. Calculus Approach (Lagrange Multipliers):   - We maximize ( f(x, y) = frac{y}{x} ) subject to ( (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3 ).   - Using Lagrange multipliers, solving the system of equations derived from the partial derivatives leads to critical points ( (1/2, sqrt{3}/2) ) and ( (1/2, -sqrt{3}/2) ).   - The corresponding slopes are ( sqrt{3} ) and ( -sqrt{3} ), giving the maximum value as ( sqrt{3} ).3. Parametric Differentiation:   - Parameterizing the circle as ( x = 2 + sqrt{3} cos theta ) and ( y = sqrt{3} sin theta ).   - Maximizing ( frac{sqrt{3} sin theta}{2 + sqrt{3} cos theta} ) leads to solving ( cos theta = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), resulting in angles ( 150^circ ) and ( 210^circ ).   - Evaluating these angles confirms the maximum slope is ( sqrt{3} ).Thus, the maximum value of ( frac{y}{x} ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8501f5e2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8501f5e2><span class="icon" data-v-8501f5e2>🔑:</span>The condition |z - 2| = sqrt{3} represents the set of points in the complex plane that lie on a circle centered at (2, 0) with a radius of sqrt{3}. Thus, we have the equation for the circle:(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 3.The ratio frac{y}{x} represents the slope of the line connecting the origin to a point (x, y) on the circle.Let&#39;s set frac{y}{x} = k, which gives us y = kx. By plugging this into the circle&#39;s equation, we get:(x - 2)^2 + (kx)^2 = 3.Now we need to find the value of k that maximizes frac{y}{x}. Extending the line from the origin with slope k will intersect the circle at a point where the derivative of y with respect to x (the slope of the tangent to the circle) is maximized. Since the slope of the radius is perpendicular to the slope of the tangent to the circle at the point of intersection, we can deduce that this will occur when the point of intersection is farthest from the x-axis, which is when the point is at (2+sqrt{3}, sqrt{3}) or (2-sqrt{3}, -sqrt{3}).Considering x neq 0, we choose the positive x-coordinates to determine the maximum value for frac{y}{x}. Thus, we have k = frac{sqrt{3}}{2+sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}(2-sqrt{3})}{(2+sqrt{3})(2-sqrt{3})} = frac{sqrt{3}(2-sqrt{3})}{4-3} = sqrt{3}(2-sqrt{3}). Hence, the maximum value of frac{y}{x} = k is realized when k = sqrt{3}.Therefore, the maximum value of frac{y}{x} is (boxed{sqrt{3}}).</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-9aa12d53><span data-v-9aa12d53>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
