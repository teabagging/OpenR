I need to solve these two problems. First, find the product of matrices A and B, which is AB. Then, use that product matrix to transform the given curve C₁ into C₂ and find the equation of C₂.Starting with part (1): Finding AB. Matrix multiplication isn't commutative, so the order matters. A is given as [[0, 1], [1, 0]], which looks like a swap matrix—it swaps the rows or columns when multiplied. B is a diagonal matrix [[1, 0], [0, 2]]. So when I multiply A and B, I need to do it in the order AB, which means A is multiplied by B.Let me recall how matrix multiplication works. Each element of the resulting matrix is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.So, let's compute AB step by step.First row of A: [0, 1]First column of B: [1, 0]. The dot product is 0*1 + 1*0 = 0.Second column of B: [0, 2]. The dot product is 0*0 + 1*2 = 2.So the first row of AB is [0, 2].Second row of A: [1, 0]First column of B: [1, 0]. The dot product is 1*1 + 0*0 = 1.Second column of B: [0, 2]. The dot product is 1*0 + 0*2 = 0.So the second row of AB is [1, 0].Putting it all together, AB is:[0, 2][1, 0]Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the order. Since it's AB, A is first, so we're multiplying A times B. So the first row of A is [0, 1], multiplied by each column of B.First column of B is [1; 0], so 0*1 + 1*0 = 0. Second column of B is [0; 2], so 0*0 +1*2 = 2. That's correct.Second row of A is [1, 0]. First column of B is [1; 0], so 1*1 + 0*0 = 1. Second column of B is [0; 2], so 1*0 +0*2 =0. Yes, that seems right. So AB is [[0, 2], [1, 0]]. Okay, that's part (1) done.Now part (2): The curve C₁ is given by (x²)/8 + (y²)/2 =1. We need to transform this curve using the matrix AB and find the equation of the resulting curve C₂.Hmm. Transforming a curve with a matrix usually involves applying the matrix to the coordinates. So if we have a transformation matrix M, then a point (x, y) on the original curve is transformed to (x', y') = M*(x, y). So to find the equation of C₂, we need to express x and y in terms of x' and y', then substitute into the original equation.Alternatively, maybe we can use the inverse transformation. Let me recall how transformations work with conic sections.Given a conic section defined by an equation, if we apply a linear transformation represented by a matrix M, the equation of the transformed conic can be found by substituting the inverse transformation. That is, if (x, y) = M⁻¹*(x', y'), then substituting into the original equation gives the equation in terms of x' and y'.Alternatively, since AB is the transformation matrix, to get from the original coordinates (x, y) to the new coordinates (x', y'), we have:[x']   [0  2] [x][y'] = [1  0] [y]Which would mean x' = 0*x + 2*y = 2y, and y' = 1*x + 0*y = x.So solving for x and y in terms of x' and y', we have:From x' = 2y ⇒ y = x'/2From y' = x ⇒ x = y'So substituting x = y' and y = x'/2 into the original equation:Original equation: (x²)/8 + (y²)/2 =1Substitute:(y')² /8 + ( (x')/2 )² /2 =1Simplify each term:First term: (y')² /8 remains as is.Second term: ( (x')² /4 ) /2 = (x')² /8So combining:(y')² /8 + (x')² /8 =1Multiply both sides by 8:(x')² + (y')² =8Wait, that's a circle with radius 2√2. But the original curve was an ellipse. Applying the transformation AB turned it into a circle? Let me check the steps again.Original curve: x²/8 + y²/2 =1. So semi-major axis along x is sqrt(8)=2√2, semi-minor axis along y is sqrt(2).Transformation matrix AB is [[0,2],[1,0]], which swaps x and y and scales. Wait, in terms of transformation, if we have (x', y') = AB*(x,y), then x' = 2y and y' = x.So the original coordinates (x, y) relate to the new coordinates (x', y') by x = y' and y = x'/2.Substituting into the original equation:(y')² /8 + (x'/2)² /2 =1.Yes, so (y')² /8 + (x')² / (8) =1. Then combining terms, (x')² + (y')² =8.So the transformed curve is x² + y² =8. Which is a circle of radius 2√2. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because the original was an ellipse. However, since the transformation includes scaling and rotation (or reflection), maybe it can turn an ellipse into a circle if the axes are scaled appropriately.But let me make sure there's no mistake. Let's verify with a sample point. Take a point on C₁. For example, let’s take x=0, then y²=2, so y=±√2. The point (0, √2) on C₁. Applying the transformation AB: x' =2*√2, y' =0. So in the transformed coordinates, it's (2√2, 0). Plugging into C₂: x² + y² = (2√2)^2 +0=8, which matches.Another point: Take y=0 on C₁. Then x²=8, so x=±2√2. The point (2√2, 0) on C₁. Applying AB: x' =2*0=0, y'=2√2. So transformed point is (0, 2√2). Plug into C₂: 0 + (2√2)^2=8, which works.Another point: Let's take a point not on the axes. For example, x=2, y=√(2*(1 - (4)/8))=√(2*(1 - 0.5))=√(1)=1. So the point (2,1). Applying AB: x'=2*1=2, y'=2. Wait, hold on. Wait, the transformation is x'=2y, y'=x. So (2,1) transformed would be x'=2*1=2, y'=2. So the transformed point is (2,2). Plug into C₂: 2² +2²=4 +4=8, which is correct.So the transformed equation x² + y²=8 is correct. Therefore, part (2)'s answer is x² + y²=8.But let me check if I need to present it in terms of the original variables. Wait, when we perform the transformation, the coordinates are transformed, so the equation in terms of the new coordinates (which are usually denoted the same as the original unless specified). But the problem says \\"the curve C₁ is transformed by the matrix AB into another curve C₂\\", so the equation of C₂ is in the standard coordinates, after applying the transformation. However, in linear transformations applied to curves, the usual approach is to express the new curve in terms of the transformed coordinates. But since the transformation is applied to the plane, the equation of C₂ in the original coordinate system is obtained by replacing (x, y) with the inverse transformation.Wait, this is a point of confusion sometimes. Let me clarify.When you apply a linear transformation to a curve, you can think of it as either:1. Active transformation: The points on the curve are transformed by the matrix, leading to a new curve in the same coordinate system.2. Passive transformation: The coordinate system is transformed, and the equation of the curve is expressed in the new coordinates.But in this problem, it says the curve C₁ is transformed by the matrix AB into C₂. So it's an active transformation: each point (x, y) on C₁ is moved to (x', y') = AB*(x, y), and the set of all such (x', y') forms C₂. Therefore, to find the equation of C₂, we need to express the relationship between x' and y' such that (x', y') = AB*(x, y) where (x, y) satisfies C₁'s equation.Therefore, to get the equation of C₂, we can express x and y in terms of x' and y', then substitute into C₁'s equation.Given that:x' = 0*x + 2*y ⇒ x' = 2yy' = 1*x + 0*y ⇒ y' = xTherefore, solving for x and y:x = y'y = x'/2So substitute x = y' and y = x'/2 into C₁'s equation:(x²)/8 + (y²)/2 =1→ ( (y')² )/8 + ( (x')/2 )² /2 =1Calculating each term:(y')² /8 + (x')² / (4*2) = (y')² /8 + (x')² /8 = (x')² + (y')² /8 =1? Wait, no, wait.Wait, (x')/2 squared is (x')² /4. Then divided by 2: (x')² /8.Similarly, (y')² /8. So adding them together:(y')² /8 + (x')² /8 =1Which is equivalent to:(x')² + (y')² =8So in terms of the transformed coordinates (x', y'), the equation is x² + y²=8. But since the problem doesn't mention changing coordinate systems, and just asks for the equation of the transformed curve in the original coordinate system, it's just x² + y²=8. Wait, but actually, no. If the transformation is applied to the points, then the coordinates (x', y') are in the same coordinate system as the original (x, y). Wait, this is confusing.Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the transformation is applied to the plane, so that each point (x, y) is moved to (x', y') = AB*(x, y). Then, the curve C₂ consists of all points (x', y') such that (x, y) was on C₁. Therefore, to get the equation of C₂ in terms of x' and y', we need to express the original variables in terms of the new ones and plug into the original equation.Which is exactly what I did. So the equation becomes (x')² + (y')² =8. But since we usually drop the primes when writing the equation in the original coordinate system, the equation of C₂ is x² + y²=8.Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is x² + y²=8. Let me check again with another point.Take a point on C₂: say (2, 2). Then according to C₂, 2² +2²=8, which is correct. The corresponding point on C₁ would be x = y' =2, y =x'/2=1. So (2,1) on C₁. Check if that's on C₁: 2²/8 +1²/2 =4/8 +1/2=0.5 +0.5=1. Correct.Another point: (0, 2√2) on C₂. Then x'=0, y'=2√2. So original x = y' =2√2, y =x'/2=0. So (2√2, 0) on C₁. Check: ( (2√2)^2 )/8 +0=8/8=1. Correct.So all the sample points work, so I think the answer is correct.Therefore, part (2) equation is x² + y²=8.Final Answer(1) boxed{begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}};(2) boxed{dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{8} = 1} or boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}Wait, hold on, the second part. The transformed equation is x² + y²=8. But maybe the problem expects it in the standard form, which for a circle would be x² + y²=8. But if they prefer it as an ellipse equation, but since it's a circle, both forms are acceptable. Wait, the original curve was an ellipse, but after transformation, it's a circle. So in standard form, the circle equation is x² + y²=8. Alternatively, you can write it as x²/8 + y²/8=1, which is the same thing.But in the problem statement, part (2) says \\"find the equation of C₂\\". The original C₁ was given as x²/8 + y²/2=1. So if we write C₂ as x² + y²=8, that's correct, but if we write it in the similar form as C₁, which is divided by 8, then x²/8 + y²/8=1. Either form is correct. However, since x² + y²=8 is simpler, perhaps that's better. But the problem might expect the same structure as C₁, so maybe x²/8 + y²/8=1. Let me check.If we write x² + y²=8, that's a circle with radius 2√2. Alternatively, x²/8 + y²/8=1 is the same equation, written in standard form. Both are correct, but maybe the answer expects the standard form. Let me see. The original C₁ was written as x²/8 + y²/2=1, which is the standard form of an ellipse. The transformed C₂ is a circle, so writing it as x² + y²=8 is acceptable, but writing it as x²/8 + y²/8=1 is also correct. Since the problem doesn't specify, but given that the original is in the x²/a² + y²/b²=1 form, maybe they expect the same for C₂, even though it's a circle.But in that case, x²/8 + y²/8=1. However, in that case, the answer is presented as x² + y²=8, which is simpler. Let me check again with the transformation.But the question says: \\"the curve C₁ is transformed by the matrix AB into another curve C₂\\", so the equation is in the original coordinate system. So when we perform the active transformation, the equation becomes x² + y²=8, which is the equation in the original coordinate system. Therefore, the answer is x² + y²=8. However, in case the problem expects the standard form with denominators, but since it's a circle, both are acceptable.But in the problem statement, part (2) says \\"find the equation of C₂\\". The original C₁ is given as x²/8 + y²/2=1, which is standard for an ellipse. If C₂ is a circle, then writing it as x² + y²=8 is correct, but also x²/8 + y²/8=1 is equivalent. However, since the circle is a special case of an ellipse, they might prefer the standard form. Let's check with the multiplication.Wait, if I leave it as x² + y²=8, that's fine. If I write it as x²/8 + y²/8=1, that's also correct. Let me see. Since the problem is from a matrices and transformations elective, perhaps they want the equation in the same form as C₁, which is (x²)/something + (y²)/something=1. Therefore, x²/8 + y²/8=1 would be parallel. But the circle equation is more concise as x² + y²=8.But I need to check the problem statement again. It says \\"find the equation of C₂\\". It doesn't specify the form. Therefore, both answers are correct, but to be safe, perhaps present both. Wait, but in the answer box, I can only put one. Wait, the user instructions say \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\". So I need to choose one. The original problem's curve was written in the standard ellipse form. Since after transformation, it's a circle, which can be written in either form. However, the most straightforward answer is x² + y²=8, but if we write it as x²/8 + y²/8=1, that's also correct. Let me check the process again.When we substitute, we ended up with (x')² + (y')²=8, so in terms of the original coordinates (if we consider the transformation as moving the points), the equation in the original coordinate system is x² + y²=8. Alternatively, if we consider the transformed coordinates (x', y'), then the equation is (x')² + (y')²=8, but since we're supposed to express C₂ in the original coordinate system, it's x² + y²=8. Therefore, I think the answer is x² + y²=8.But let me check with another perspective. Suppose the transformation matrix AB is applied to the plane, so every point (x, y) is mapped to (2y, x). Then the curve C₂ is the image of C₁ under this transformation. So to find the equation of C₂, we take a general point (X, Y) on C₂, which is the image of a point (x, y) on C₁. Thus, X=2y and Y=x. Therefore, x=Y and y=X/2. Substituting into C₁'s equation:(Y)²/8 + (X/2)²/2 =1Which is Y²/8 + X²/(8) =1, so X² + Y²=8. Therefore, the equation is X² + Y²=8. Replacing X and Y with x and y (since the coordinates are just dummy variables), the equation is x² + y²=8.Therefore, the correct answer is x² + y²=8. So boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8} is the answer for part (2).Final Answer(1) boxed{begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}};(2) boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}</think>(1) To find the product (AB) of matrices (A) and (B):Given matrices:[ A = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}, quad B = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix} ]Multiplying (A) and (B):[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & 0 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 0 & 0 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 2  1 cdot 1 + 0 cdot 0 & 1 cdot 0 + 0 cdot 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}](2) To find the equation of the curve (C_2) after transforming (C_1: frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1) by the matrix (AB):The transformation matrix (AB) is:[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}]This transformation maps a point ((x, y)) to ((x', y')) where:[x' = 2y quad text{and} quad y' = x]Expressing (x) and (y) in terms of (x') and (y'):[x = y' quad text{and} quad y = frac{x'}{2}]Substituting these into the original equation of (C_1):[frac{(y')^2}{8} + frac{left(frac{x'}{2}right)^2}{2} = 1]Simplifying:[frac{(y')^2}{8} + frac{(x')^2}{8} = 1 implies (x')^2 + (y')^2 = 8]Thus, the equation of the transformed curve (C_2) is:[x^2 + y^2 = 8] Final Answer(1) (boxed{begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}})(2) (boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}),<think>Okay, so I need to solve this problem about matrices and transformations. Let's take it step by step. The first part is to find the product of matrices A and B, which is AB. Then, using that matrix AB, I have to figure out how it transforms the given curve C₁ into C₂ and find the equation of C₂. Starting with part (1): Finding AB. Matrix A is given as:[A = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}]And matrix B is:[B = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix}]To multiply these matrices, AB means we apply B first and then A, right? Wait, actually, when we write AB, it's A multiplied by B, so the order is important. Matrix multiplication is not commutative, so AB might not be equal to BA. Let me remember how matrix multiplication works. Each element of the resulting matrix is the dot product of the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix.So, let's compute AB. First, the resulting matrix will be 2x2 since both A and B are 2x2. Let me denote AB as:[AB = begin{bmatrix} (0*1 + 1*0) & (0*0 + 1*2)  (1*1 + 0*0) & (1*0 + 0*2) end{bmatrix}]Wait, hold on. Let me recast that properly. The element in the first row, first column of AB is computed by taking the first row of A and the first column of B. So first row of A is [0, 1], first column of B is [1, 0]. So 0*1 + 1*0 = 0 + 0 = 0.First row, second column: first row of A [0,1] and second column of B [0,2]. So 0*0 + 1*2 = 0 + 2 = 2.Second row, first column: second row of A [1,0] and first column of B [1,0]. So 1*1 + 0*0 = 1 + 0 = 1.Second row, second column: second row of A [1,0] and second column of B [0,2]. So 1*0 + 0*2 = 0 + 0 = 0.So putting it all together, AB is:[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}]Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's verify each entry again.First entry: row 1 of A, column 1 of B: 0*1 + 1*0 = 0. Correct.Second entry: row 1 of A, column 2 of B: 0*0 + 1*2 = 2. Correct.Third entry: row 2 of A, column 1 of B: 1*1 + 0*0 = 1. Correct.Fourth entry: row 2 of A, column 2 of B: 1*0 + 0*2 = 0. Correct. So yes, AB is indeed:[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}]Okay, that seems right. So part (1) is done. AB is the matrix above.Now part (2): Transforming the curve C₁ using the matrix AB into C₂, and finding the equation of C₂.The given curve is C₁: (x²)/8 + (y²)/2 = 1. That's an ellipse, right? Because it's in the standard form of an ellipse (x²/a² + y²/b² = 1). So the original ellipse has semi-major axis length sqrt(8) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis sqrt(2) along the y-axis.But when we apply a linear transformation using matrix AB, the ellipse will be transformed into another ellipse (or possibly another conic section, but since linear transformations preserve the degree, it should still be an ellipse). To find the equation of the transformed curve, we need to figure out how the transformation affects the coordinates (x, y).First, let me recall that when a linear transformation is applied using a matrix M, the transformation takes a point (x, y) to (M11*x + M12*y, M21*x + M22*y). So, if we denote the transformed coordinates as (x', y'), then:x' = M11*x + M12*yy' = M21*x + M22*yBut in our case, the matrix AB is the transformation matrix. So we need to express the original coordinates (x, y) in terms of the new coordinates (x', y'), or vice versa. Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.Alternatively, if we consider that applying the transformation matrix AB to the curve C₁, we can represent the transformation as:If a point (x, y) lies on C₁, then after applying AB, the new point (x', y') is AB * [x; y]. So:[begin{bmatrix} x'  y' end{bmatrix} = AB begin{bmatrix} x  y end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x  y end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0*x + 2*y  1*x + 0*y end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 2y  x end{bmatrix}]So, x' = 2y and y' = x.Therefore, to find the equation of C₂, which is the image of C₁ under AB, we can substitute x and y in terms of x' and y' into the original equation.Since x' = 2y and y' = x, we can solve for x and y in terms of x' and y'. Let's do that.From y' = x, we get x = y'.From x' = 2y, we get y = x' / 2.So substituting back into the original equation:Original equation: (x²)/8 + (y²)/2 = 1Substituting x = y' and y = x'/2:( (y')² ) /8 + ( (x'/2)² ) /2 = 1Simplify each term:First term: (y')² /8Second term: (x'^2 /4)/2 = x'^2 /8So combining them:(y')² /8 + (x')² /8 = 1Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:(y')² + (x')² = 8But since x' and y' are just the coordinates of the transformed curve, we can rewrite this equation in terms of x and y (without the primes) for C₂. So replacing x' with x and y' with y:y² + x² = 8Which simplifies to:x² + y² = 8Wait, so the transformed curve C₂ is a circle with radius sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). That's interesting. The original ellipse is transformed into a circle by the matrix AB.But let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the transformation:Original coordinates (x, y) are transformed by AB to (x', y') = (2y, x). So to express x and y in terms of x' and y', we invert this relationship.From x' = 2y ⇒ y = x'/2From y' = x ⇒ x = y'So substituting into the original equation:(x²)/8 + (y²)/2 = ( (y')² )/8 + ( (x'/2)² )/2 = (y'²)/8 + (x'²)/4/2 = (y'²)/8 + (x'²)/8 = (x'² + y'²)/8 = 1 ⇒ x'² + y'² = 8. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the equation of C₂ is x² + y² = 8. So simplifying, we can write it as x² + y² = 8. So in standard form, it's a circle centered at the origin with radius 2√2.But let me double-check if I inverted the transformation correctly. Let's see, if (x', y') = AB*(x, y) = (2y, x), then to get x and y in terms of x' and y', since y' = x, so x = y'. And x' = 2y ⇒ y = x'/2. That's correct. So substitution is correct.Alternatively, another way to think about transformations on conic sections is using matrix representation. The general equation of a conic is X^T Q X = 1, where X is a vector [x; y] and Q is a matrix. For the original ellipse, (x²)/8 + (y²)/2 = 1, the matrix Q is diagonal with entries 1/8 and 1/2.When we apply a linear transformation with matrix M, the transformed conic is given by (M^{-1}X)^T Q (M^{-1}X) = 1. So expanding that, X^T (M^{-T} Q M^{-1}) X = 1. Therefore, the new matrix Q' is M^{-T} Q M^{-1}. So if we compute that, we can get the equation of the transformed conic.But maybe this method is more complicated, but let's try it to verify.First, original Q matrix is:Q = begin{bmatrix} 1/8 & 0  0 & 1/2 end{bmatrix}Transformation matrix M is AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}So we need to compute M^{-T} Q M^{-1}First, find the inverse of M. Let's compute M inverse.Given M = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}The determinant of M is (0)(0) - (2)(1) = -2. Therefore, inverse of M is (1/det(M)) * begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2  -1 & 0 end{bmatrix} = (1/-2)*begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2  -1 & 0 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  0.5 & 0 end{bmatrix}Wait, let's check:Original matrix M:Row 1: 0, 2Row 2: 1, 0To compute inverse, swap diagonal elements, change sign of off-diagonal, divide by determinant.But the formula is:For a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d], inverse is [d -b; -c a] / (ad - bc)So for M:a = 0, b = 2, c = 1, d = 0Determinant: (0)(0) - (2)(1) = -2Inverse is [0 -2; -1 0] / (-2) = [0/(-2) (-2)/(-2); (-1)/(-2) 0/(-2)] = [0 1; 0.5 0]So M^{-1} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  0.5 & 0 end{bmatrix}Therefore, M^{-T} is the transpose of M^{-1}, which is begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}Now compute Q' = M^{-T} Q M^{-1}First, compute M^{-T} Q:M^{-T} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.5  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}Multiply by Q = begin{bmatrix} 1/8 & 0  0 & 1/2 end{bmatrix}Result is:First row: 0*(1/8) + 0.5*(0) = 0; 0*0 + 0.5*(1/2) = 0.25Second row: 1*(1/8) + 0*0 = 1/8; 1*0 + 0*(1/2) = 0Wait, no. Wait, matrix multiplication is rows of first matrix times columns of second matrix. Let's do it properly.First row of M^{-T} is [0, 0.5]Multiply by columns of Q:First column of Q: [1/8, 0]Second column of Q: [0, 1/2]So first entry: 0*(1/8) + 0.5*0 = 0Second entry: 0*0 + 0.5*(1/2) = 0.25Second row of M^{-T} is [1, 0]Multiply by columns of Q:First column: 1*(1/8) + 0*0 = 1/8Second column: 1*0 + 0*(1/2) = 0Therefore, M^{-T} Q is:[begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.25  1/8 & 0 end{bmatrix}]Now multiply this by M^{-1} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  0.5 & 0 end{bmatrix}Compute the product:First row: [0, 0.25] multiplied by columns of M^{-1}First column of M^{-1}: [0, 0.5]0*0 + 0.25*0.5 = 0.125Second column of M^{-1}: [1, 0]0*1 + 0.25*0 = 0Second row: [1/8, 0] multiplied by columns of M^{-1}First column: 1/8*0 + 0*0.5 = 0Second column: 1/8*1 + 0*0 = 1/8Therefore, the resulting matrix Q' is:[begin{bmatrix} 0.125 & 0  0 & 1/8 end{bmatrix}]So the transformed conic equation is X^T Q' X = 1, which translates to:0.125x² + (1/8)y² = 1But 0.125 is 1/8, so:(1/8)x² + (1/8)y² = 1Multiply both sides by 8:x² + y² = 8Which is the same result as before! So that confirms the equation of C₂ is x² + y² = 8. Therefore, part (2) answer is x² + y² = 8.But just to be thorough, let me think about another approach. If we consider the effect of the transformation AB on the ellipse. The original ellipse is stretched and maybe rotated.Matrix AB is begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}This matrix has the effect of swapping x and y coordinates and scaling. Let me see:Multiplying a vector [x, y] by AB gives [2y, x]. So, it's like taking the original x-coordinate, moving it to the y-coordinate, and scaling the original y-coordinate by 2 and putting it in the x-coordinate. So it's a combination of a reflection (swap of x and y) and scaling.In terms of transformations, swapping x and y is equivalent to a reflection over the line y = x, and then scaling the new x-axis (which was the original y-axis) by 2.Therefore, the ellipse C₁, which was originally stretched along the x-axis with semi-major axis sqrt(8) and along y-axis with semi-minor axis sqrt(2), after transformation, the stretching along the original y-axis (which becomes the new x-axis) is scaled by 2, and the original x-axis (now y-axis) remains the same.Wait, so the original ellipse has semi-major axis along x with length sqrt(8) and semi-minor axis along y with sqrt(2). After swapping x and y, the major axis would be along y, and minor along x. But then scaling the new x-axis (original y-axis) by 2. So the semi-minor axis (which was sqrt(2) along original y-axis) becomes scaled by 2, so 2*sqrt(2) along the new x-axis. The semi-major axis (originally sqrt(8) along x) becomes along the new y-axis, still sqrt(8). But sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2), so both axes are 2*sqrt(2). Hence, it becomes a circle with radius 2*sqrt(2). That's consistent with the equation x² + y² = 8.Therefore, all the different approaches lead to the same conclusion. So I'm confident that the equation of C₂ is x² + y² = 8.Final Answer(1) boxed{begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}};(2) boxed{dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{8} = 1} or boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}Wait, the problem says to put the final answer within boxed{} for each part. The first part is the matrix, which I have as AB = [0 2; 1 0]. The second part is the equation of C₂. The user wrote \\"find the equation of C₂\\". The equation can be written as x² + y² = 8, which is a circle. Alternatively, if written in standard form, since it's a circle, but technically the standard form for a circle is x² + y² = r². However, if they prefer the ellipse form (even though it's a circle), maybe they want it as x²/8 + y²/8 =1. Either is correct, but since a circle is a special case of an ellipse, perhaps writing both is okay. Let me check my previous step.From substitution, we had (x')² + (y')² =8. If they want the equation in terms of x and y (without primes), it's x² + y² =8. Alternatively, dividing both sides by 8 gives x²/8 + y²/8 =1, which is also correct. Depending on how the question expects the answer. Since the original equation was in the form x²/a² + y²/b² =1, maybe they expect the same form, so x²/8 + y²/8=1. But x² + y²=8 is simpler. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \\"find the equation of C₂\\". It doesn't specify the form, so both are correct. But maybe they want it in standard form. For a circle, standard form is x² + y² = r². For an ellipse, it's x²/a² + y²/b²=1. Since the transformed curve is a circle, writing it as x² + y²=8 is appropriate. However, if written as x²/8 + y²/8=1, that's also acceptable. The question might accept either. Given that the original equation was written as x²/8 + y²/2 =1, maybe the transformed equation should follow the same structure. So, x²/8 + y²/8 =1. Either way, both equations are equivalent. The answer can be written either as x² + y² =8 or x²/8 + y²/8 =1. To be safe, perhaps present both. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe the simplest form is x² + y²=8. However, in the problem's original equation, they have denominators, so maybe they expect the same style. Hmm. Let me think.Original equation: x²/8 + y²/2=1. The transformed equation is x² + y²=8. Alternatively, if written as x²/8 + y²/8=1. Let me check if the problem in Chinese (assuming translation) has any preference. Since it's from an elective course, perhaps following the same structure is better. Since the original is in ellipse form, even though the transformed is a circle, writing it as x²/8 + y²/8=1 is more consistent. So maybe that's the expected answer.But the user wrote \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\" for each part. For part (2), the problem says \\"find the equation of C₂\\". In the original problem, C₁ is given in the form x²/8 + y²/2=1, which is standard ellipse form. The transformed curve, if it's a circle, can be written as x² + y²=8. However, if written as x²/8 + y²/8=1, that's still correct. Let me check which one is more appropriate.In the context of transformations, when you apply a linear transformation to an ellipse, the resulting equation can be written in the standard form by using the inverse transformation. Since in the original C₁, the equation is in terms of x and y, and after the transformation, we express the original x and y in terms of the new coordinates. But in the final answer, since we're expressing the new curve in terms of the new coordinates (which we can rename back to x and y), the equation is x² + y²=8. Therefore, that's the equation of C₂. So I think the answer should be boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}. Alternatively, if they require the standard ellipse form, then boxed{dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{8} = 1}. But since it's a circle, x² + y²=8 is more straightforward. Let me confirm once more with my previous steps.Original substitution gave me x'² + y'²=8, then relabeling the coordinates gives x² + y²=8. So yes, that's correct. Hence, I think boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8} is the answer for part (2). The other form is also correct but redundant since it's a circle. So probably the expected answer is x² + y²=8.Final Answer(1) boxed{begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}};(2) boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 8}</think>(1) To find the product of matrices (A) and (B):Given matrices:[A = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}, quad B = begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix}]The product (AB) is calculated as follows:[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1  1 & 0 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 0 & 0 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 2  1 cdot 1 + 0 cdot 0 & 1 cdot 0 + 0 cdot 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}](2) To find the equation of the curve (C_2) transformed by the matrix (AB):The original curve (C_1) is given by:[frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1]The transformation matrix (AB) is:[AB = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix}]Applying the transformation to a point ((x, y)), the new coordinates ((x', y')) are:[begin{bmatrix} x'  y' end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2  1 & 0 end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} x  y end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 2y  x end{bmatrix}]Thus, (x' = 2y) and (y' = x).

Olympiad 1972}subsection*{9.14.1 First Round 1972, Class 12}","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to find the value of 'a' that minimizes the maximum distance between the two functions f(x) and g(x) over the interval [-2, 2]. The distance is defined as the largest absolute difference between f(x) and g(x) in that interval. Let me start by understanding both functions.First, f(x) = 2 - |x|. That's a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0, 2). It decreases linearly with a slope of -1 for x > 0 and slope 1 for x < 0, hitting the x-axis at x = 2 and x = -2. So at x=0, f(x)=2, and at x=±2, f(x)=0.Next, g(x) = -a x² + 2. This is a downward-opening parabola (since the coefficient of x² is negative) with vertex at (0, 2). The parameter 'a' controls how \\"wide\\" or \\"narrow\\" the parabola is. A larger 'a' makes the parabola narrower (steeper), while a smaller 'a' makes it wider (shallower).The problem is to find the value of 'a' such that the maximum vertical distance between f(x) and g(x) over the interval [-2, 2] is minimized. So, essentially, we need to minimize the maximum of |f(x) - g(x)| over x in [-2, 2].Let me write the expression for the difference between the two functions:|f(x) - g(x)| = |(2 - |x|) - (-a x² + 2)| = | - |x| + a x² | = |a x² - |x||.So, we need to minimize the maximum value of |a x² - |x|| over x in [-2, 2]. Since both functions are even (symmetric about the y-axis), we can consider x ≥ 0 and double the interval to [0, 2], which might simplify things.So, let's define h(x) = a x² - x for x in [0, 2]. Then, the absolute value |h(x)| is the quantity we need to consider. Our goal is to choose 'a' such that the maximum of |h(x)| over [0, 2] is minimized.This seems like a problem in approximation theory, specifically minimax approximation. The idea is to find the coefficient 'a' such that the maximum deviation between the two functions is minimized. I remember that in such problems, the optimal solution occurs when the maximum error is minimized and the error alternates between its maximum and minimum values at several points in the interval. According to the equioscillation theorem, the best approximation will equioscillate between at least n+2 points for polynomials of degree n. But here, since we are fitting a quadratic function to a piecewise linear function, maybe the optimal 'a' will have the maximum error occurring at three points?Alternatively, maybe we can approach this by calculus. To find the maximum of |h(x)|, we can look for critical points where the derivative is zero, as well as check the endpoints.First, let's consider h(x) = a x² - x. The absolute value |h(x)| can be analyzed by considering where h(x) is positive or negative.Since a is positive, h(x) is a quadratic function in x. Let's see:h(x) = a x² - x. The parabola opens upwards because the coefficient of x² is positive. The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) for ax² + bx + c, so here, it's x = (1)/(2a). At x = 1/(2a), h(x) = a*(1/(4a²)) - 1/(2a) = 1/(4a) - 1/(2a) = -1/(4a). So, the vertex is at (1/(2a), -1/(4a)). Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum of h(x) is at this vertex.So, h(x) = a x² - x is negative at x = 1/(2a), with value -1/(4a). Therefore, |h(x)| reaches a maximum either at the endpoints x=0, x=2, or at critical points where h(x) is maximum in absolute value.But since h(x) is a quadratic, let's analyze the behavior over [0, 2].At x=0: h(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. So |h(0)| = 0.At x=2: h(2) = a*(4) - 2 = 4a - 2. So |h(2)| = |4a - 2|.The vertex of h(x) is at x = 1/(2a). Let's check whether this vertex is within the interval [0, 2]. Since a > 0, 1/(2a) > 0. So, we need to check if 1/(2a) ≤ 2. That is, 1/(2a) ≤ 2 => 1/2 ≤ 2a => a ≥ 1/4. So, if a ≥ 1/4, the vertex is within [0, 0.5], otherwise, if a < 1/4, the vertex is at x = 1/(2a) > 2. Wait, no, if a < 1/4, then 1/(2a) > 2, which is outside the interval [0, 2]. So, for a < 1/4, the minimum of h(x) occurs outside the interval, so h(x) is increasing on [0, 2], since the vertex is to the right of 2, and since the parabola opens upwards. Wait, but if a < 1/4, then h(x) = a x² - x. The derivative is h'(x) = 2 a x - 1. Setting derivative zero gives x = 1/(2a) > 2 (since a < 1/4). So, on [0, 2], h'(x) = 2 a x - 1. At x=0, h'(0) = -1 < 0. At x=2, h'(2) = 4a -1. If a < 1/4, then 4a -1 < 0. Therefore, the derivative is always negative on [0, 2], so h(x) is decreasing on [0, 2]. Therefore, h(x) starts at 0 when x=0, decreases to h(2) = 4a - 2. So, since h(x) is decreasing, the maximum of |h(x)| on [0, 2] would be the maximum between |h(0)|=0 and |h(2)|=|4a - 2|. But since h(x) is decreasing from 0 to 4a - 2. If 4a - 2 is negative (i.e., a < 0.5), then the maximum |h(x)| is |4a - 2| = 2 - 4a. If 4a - 2 is non-negative (a ≥ 0.5), then |h(2)|=4a - 2, but since h(x) is decreasing from 0 to 4a - 2, which would be positive. Wait, but if a ≥ 0.5, h(2) = 4a - 2 ≥ 0, but since the function h(x) starts at 0 and increases? Wait, no, because if a ≥ 0.5, then h'(x) = 2 a x -1. At x=0, h'(0) = -1. At x=2, h'(2) = 4a -1. If a ≥ 0.5, then 4a -1 ≥ 4*(0.5) -1 = 2 -1 =1 >0. Therefore, h(x) is decreasing at x=0, reaches a minimum at x=1/(2a) (which, if a ≥0.5, then 1/(2a) ≤1), then increases after that. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, let's recast:If a ≥ 1/4, the vertex x=1/(2a) is ≤ 2. But if a ≥0.5, the vertex is at x=1/(2a) ≤1/(2*0.5)=1. So, h(x) is decreasing on [0, 1/(2a)] and increasing on [1/(2a), 2]. Therefore, the minimum of h(x) is at x=1/(2a), which is -1/(4a). Then, h(x) increases from there to x=2, where h(2)=4a -2.Therefore, the maximum of |h(x)| on [0, 2] for a ≥1/4 is the maximum of |h(0)|=0, |h(2)|=|4a -2|, and |h(1/(2a))|=1/(4a). So, depending on the value of a, the maximum could be either |4a -2| or 1/(4a).So, for a ≥1/4, we need to compare 1/(4a) and |4a - 2|.But 4a -2 can be positive or negative. Let's see:If a ≥ 0.5, then 4a -2 ≥0. So |4a -2|=4a -2. If 1/4 ≤a <0.5, then 4a -2 <0, so |4a -2|=2 -4a.Therefore, for a ≥1/4, the maximum of |h(x)| is the maximum between 1/(4a) and |4a -2|.So, to find the minimal maximum |h(x)|, we need to find 'a' such that these two values are equal, because if we can set them equal, then the maximum will be the same at both points, which might be the minimal possible maximum.Wait, this is a common approach in optimization: to balance the maximums at different points. So, if we can make the maximum at x=2 equal to the maximum at x=1/(2a), then that might give the minimal possible maximum.Therefore, set 1/(4a) = |4a - 2|.But this depends on whether 4a -2 is positive or negative.Case 1: a ≥0.5Then, |4a -2|=4a -2. So set 1/(4a) =4a -2.Multiply both sides by 4a: 1 = 16a² -8aThen, 16a² -8a -1=0.Solving quadratic equation:a = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 64)] /32 = [8 ± sqrt(128)] /32 = [8 ± 8*sqrt(2)] /32 = [1 ± sqrt(2)] /4But since a ≥0.5, let's compute the roots:[1 + sqrt(2)] /4 ≈ (1 +1.414)/4 ≈2.414/4≈0.6035[1 - sqrt(2)] /4≈(1 -1.414)/4≈(-0.414)/4≈-0.1035Discard the negative root. So a≈0.6035, which is greater than 0.5, so valid.Case 2: 1/4 ≤a <0.5Then, |4a -2|=2 -4a. So set 1/(4a) =2 -4a.Multiply both sides by 4a: 1 =8a -16a²Then, 16a² -8a +1=0Quadratic equation: a = [8 ± sqrt(64 -64)] /32 = [8 ±0]/32 = 8/32=0.25So a=0.25. But 0.25 is exactly 1/4, which is the lower bound of this case. But in this case, we considered 1/4 ≤a <0.5, and the solution is a=1/4. So, let's check if at a=1/4, 1/(4a)=1/(4*(1/4))=1, and 2 -4a=2 -1=1. So yes, they are equal. Therefore, at a=1/4, the maximum |h(x)| is 1. But wait, if a=1/4, then h(x)= (1/4)x² -x. Let's check at x=2: h(2)= (1/4)*4 -2=1 -2=-1. So |h(2)|=1. At the vertex x=1/(2a)=1/(2*(1/4))=2. So the vertex is at x=2. But x=2 is the endpoint. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, when a=1/4, the vertex is at x=1/(2*(1/4))=2. So the vertex is at x=2. But that's the endpoint. Therefore, h(x) is decreasing on [0,2], since the vertex is at x=2. Wait, but if a=1/4, h'(x)=2*(1/4)x -1= (1/2)x -1. At x=0, derivative is -1. At x=2, derivative is (1/2)*2 -1=1 -1=0. So h(x) is decreasing on [0,2], with minimum at x=2. Therefore, the maximum |h(x)| occurs at x=2, which is |h(2)|=1. However, if we set a=1/4, then h(x) is decreasing from 0 at x=0 to -1 at x=2. So the maximum |h(x)| is 1. But if we take a slightly larger than 1/4, say a=0.3, then let's compute:At a=0.3, which is in the case 1/4 <a <0.5.h(x)=0.3x² -x.The vertex is at x=1/(2*0.3)=1/0.6≈1.6667.At the vertex, h(x)=0.3*(1.6667)^2 -1.6667≈0.3*(2.7778) -1.6667≈0.8333 -1.6667≈-0.8334. So |h(x)|≈0.8334.At x=2, h(2)=0.3*4 -2=1.2 -2=-0.8. So |h(2)|=0.8.So the maximum is 0.8334, which is larger than 0.8. So in this case, the maximum |h(x)| is at the vertex.But if we set a=0.25, the maximum is 1, which is larger. So as a increases from 0.25 to 0.5, the maximum |h(x)| at the vertex decreases from 1 to ?Wait, wait, when a=0.5, h(x)=0.5x² -x. The vertex is at x=1/(2*0.5)=1. At x=1, h(1)=0.5*1 -1= -0.5. So |h(1)|=0.5. At x=2, h(2)=0.5*4 -2=2 -2=0. So |h(2)|=0. So for a=0.5, the maximum |h(x)| is 0.5 at x=1. But if a=0.5, then the maximum |h(x)| over [0,2] is 0.5. But in the previous case when a≈0.6035, the maximum |h(x)| is 1/(4a)≈1/(4*0.6035)≈0.414. So this is smaller.Therefore, there seems to be a minimal value somewhere when a is greater than 0.5. So when a increases beyond 0.5, the maximum |h(x)| is the maximum between 1/(4a) and 4a -2. So when a=0.5, 4a -2=0, and 1/(4a)=0.5. As a increases beyond 0.5, 4a -2 increases, but 1/(4a) decreases. So perhaps the two functions 1/(4a) and 4a -2 cross somewhere, and the minimal maximum is achieved when they are equal.Yes, this is what we considered in case 1. So setting 1/(4a)=4a -2 gives a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035. Then, at this a, the maximum |h(x)| is 1/(4a)=4a -2. Let's compute it:1/(4a)=1/(4*(1 + sqrt(2))/4)=1/(1 + sqrt(2))≈1/2.414≈0.414.Similarly, 4a -2=4*(1 + sqrt(2))/4 -2=1 + sqrt(2) -2=sqrt(2)-1≈0.414. So both are equal, as expected.So, this gives the minimal maximum |h(x)|≈0.414, achieved at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4.But wait, let me confirm. If we take a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035, then:At x=1/(2a)=1/(2*(1 + sqrt(2))/4)=4/(2*(1 + sqrt(2)))=2/(1 + sqrt(2))≈2/2.414≈0.828. So x≈0.828.At this x, h(x)=a x² -x. Let's compute:a x² -x = a*( (2/(1 + sqrt(2)))^2 ) - (2/(1 + sqrt(2)))First, compute (2/(1 + sqrt(2)))^2:Denominator: (1 + sqrt(2))^2=1 + 2 sqrt(2) +2=3 + 2 sqrt(2)So (2)^2 / (3 + 2 sqrt(2))=4/(3 + 2 sqrt(2)).Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 - 2 sqrt(2)):4*(3 - 2 sqrt(2))/[(3)^2 - (2 sqrt(2))^2]=4*(3 - 2 sqrt(2))/(9 -8)=4*(3 - 2 sqrt(2))/1=12 -8 sqrt(2).So a x² = a*(4/(3 + 2 sqrt(2)))= [(1 + sqrt(2))/4]*(12 -8 sqrt(2)) ?Wait, perhaps another approach. Since a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4, and x=2/(1 + sqrt(2)), let's compute a x²:a x² = [(1 + sqrt(2))/4] * [4/(1 + sqrt(2))^2] = [(1 + sqrt(2))/4] * [4/( (1 + sqrt(2))^2 ) ]= [1/( (1 + sqrt(2)) ) ].Then, subtract x=2/(1 + sqrt(2)):So h(x)=a x² -x= [1/(1 + sqrt(2))] - [2/(1 + sqrt(2))]= -1/(1 + sqrt(2)).Therefore, |h(x)|=1/(1 + sqrt(2))≈0.414, which matches the previous calculation.Similarly, at x=2, h(2)=4a -2=4*(1 + sqrt(2))/4 -2=1 + sqrt(2) -2=sqrt(2)-1≈0.414. So |h(2)|=sqrt(2)-1≈0.414.Therefore, at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4, the maximum |h(x)| is sqrt(2)-1≈0.414, occurring both at x=2 and at x=1/(2a)≈0.828. Additionally, since the function h(x) is a quadratic, the graph of |h(x)| will have a peak at x=1/(2a) and another peak at x=2. But since the values at both points are equal, the maximum is the same. Therefore, this is the minimal maximum.Now, we need to check if there are any other points in [0,2] where |h(x)| could be larger. For that, we can check the value at x=1.At x=1, h(1)=a*1 -1=a -1. So |h(1)|=|a -1|.At a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035, |h(1)|=|0.6035 -1|=0.3965, which is less than 0.414. So indeed, the maximum is at x≈0.828 and x=2.Therefore, the minimal maximum occurs when a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4, and the maximum distance is sqrt(2)-1.But wait, the problem is over the interval [-2,2], but we considered x ≥0. Since both functions are even, the analysis for x ≤0 is symmetric, so the maximum will occur in [0,2], so we don't have to worry about the negative side.Therefore, the minimal maximum distance is achieved when a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035, and this is the value of 'a' that minimizes the distance between f and g.But let me check another point. Suppose we take a different value of 'a', say a=0.5. Then, as computed earlier, the maximum |h(x)| is 0.5. If a=0.6, then compute:a=0.6:At vertex x=1/(2*0.6)=0.8333. h(x)=0.6*(0.8333)^2 -0.8333≈0.6*0.6944 -0.8333≈0.4166 -0.8333≈-0.4167. So |h(x)|≈0.4167.At x=2, h(2)=0.6*4 -2=2.4 -2=0.4. So |h(2)|=0.4. Therefore, the maximum is 0.4167, which is higher than the value at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035, which is≈0.414. So indeed, the minimal maximum is achieved at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4.Therefore, the answer should be a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4.But let's make sure there isn't a lower value. Suppose we take a higher 'a', say a=0.7:At a=0.7, vertex at x=1/(2*0.7)≈0.7143. h(x)=0.7*(0.7143)^2 -0.7143≈0.7*0.5102 -0.7143≈0.3571 -0.7143≈-0.3572. |h(x)|≈0.3572.At x=2, h(2)=0.7*4 -2=2.8 -2=0.8. So |h(2)|=0.8. Therefore, the maximum is 0.8, which is higher than the previous maximum. So as a increases beyond (1 + sqrt(2))/4≈0.6035, the value at x=2 increases, overtaking the value at the vertex. Therefore, the minimal maximum occurs exactly when the two are equal, at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4.Therefore, the value of 'a' that minimizes the distance is (1 + sqrt(2))/4.But let me check if this is correct by considering the original problem. The functions are f(x)=2 -|x| and g(x)=-a x² +2. Wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says g(x)=-a x² +2, which is a downward-opening parabola. But in my analysis above, I considered g(x)=a x² +2, which is upward-opening. Did I misread the problem?Oh no! Wait, the problem states g(x)=-a x² +2. So that's a downward-opening parabola. My mistake was in the initial analysis. So h(x)=f(x)-g(x)= (2 -|x|) - (-a x² +2)=2 -|x| +a x² -2= a x² -|x|. So that part is correct. So |h(x)|=|a x² - |x||. However, since g(x) is a downward-opening parabola, h(x)=a x² -|x|. But a is positive. Therefore, h(x)=a x² -|x| is a upward-opening parabola (since coefficient a is positive) minus the absolute value function. Wait, but the difference is still h(x)=a x² -|x|. So my previous analysis was correct because h(x)=a x² -|x|, which is a quadratic function minus a V-shaped function. However, when considering x ≥0, h(x)=a x² -x, which is a quadratic opening upwards. So my previous analysis still holds.But wait, when I considered the graph of h(x)=a x² -x, it's a quadratic opening upwards, so the vertex is at x=1/(2a). But since we are subtracting x, which is a linear term, the parabola opens upwards. However, since g(x) is a downward-opening parabola, the difference h(x) becomes an upward-opening parabola minus a linear function. Therefore, the analysis still holds.Therefore, my previous conclusion that the minimal maximum occurs at a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4 is correct. But let me double-check with the correct g(x).Given f(x)=2 -|x| and g(x)=-a x² +2. Then, the difference is h(x)=f(x)-g(x)=2 -|x| - (-a x² +2)=2 -|x| +a x² -2= a x² -|x|. Therefore, |h(x)|=|a x² -|x||. So yes, as before.Therefore, the analysis is correct, and the minimal maximum occurs when a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4.Therefore, the answer is a=(1 + sqrt(2))/4. To write this as a boxed expression:boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}}Final AnswerThe value of (a) that minimizes the distance is boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}}.</think>To find the value of (a) that minimizes the maximum distance between the functions (f(x) = 2 - |x|) and (g(x) = -ax^2 + 2) over the interval ([-2, 2]), we need to analyze the absolute difference (|f(x) - g(x)|).The absolute difference is given by:[|f(x) - g(x)| = |(2 - |x|) - (-ax^2 + 2)| = |ax^2 - |x||]We consider the interval ([0, 2]) due to symmetry. Let (h(x) = ax^2 - x). The goal is to minimize the maximum value of (|h(x)|) over ([0, 2]).1. Critical Points Analysis:   - The vertex of (h(x) = ax^2 - x) is at (x = frac{1}{2a}).   - The value of (h(x)) at the vertex is (-frac{1}{4a}).   - The endpoints (x = 0) and (x = 2) must also be considered.2. Case Analysis:   - For (a geq frac{1}{4}), the vertex (x = frac{1}{2a}) is within ([0, 2]).   - For (a < frac{1}{4}), the vertex is outside ([0, 2]), and (h(x)) is decreasing on ([0, 2]).3. Equating Maximum Values:   - For (a geq frac{1}{2}), the maximum value at (x = 2) is (4a - 2).   - The maximum value at the vertex is (frac{1}{4a}).   - Setting these equal: (frac{1}{4a} = 4a - 2).4. Solving the Equation:   - Solving (frac{1}{4a} = 4a - 2) leads to the quadratic equation (16a^2 - 8a - 1 = 0).   - The positive solution is (a = frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}).5. Verification:   - At (a = frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}), the maximum values at (x = 2) and the vertex are equal, confirming the minimal maximum distance.Thus, the value of (a) that minimizes the distance is (boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}}).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of 'a' that minimizes the maximum distance between two functions, f(x) and g(x), over the interval from -2 to 2. The distance is defined as the largest absolute difference between the two functions in that interval. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, the functions are given as f(x) = 2 - |x| and g(x) = -a x² + 2, where a is a positive real number. I need to find the value of 'a' that makes the maximum of |f(x) - g(x)| as small as possible. So essentially, I need to minimize the maximum error between these two functions over the interval.Let me visualize both functions. The function f(x) = 2 - |x| is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at (0, 2) and slopes of -1 and 1 on either side. It will form a triangle between x = -2 and x = 2. At x = -2 and x = 2, f(x) will be 2 - 2 = 0. So it starts at (2, 0) and (-2, 0), peaks at (0, 2).Then, the function g(x) = -a x² + 2 is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0, 2) as well. The coefficient 'a' controls how \\"wide\\" or \\"narrow\\" the parabola is. Since a is positive, it opens downward. The larger the 'a', the narrower the parabola, and the smaller the 'a', the wider it is. So for very small 'a', the parabola is almost flat, just slightly curving downward from 2. For large 'a', it's a steep parabola that dips down quickly from the vertex.The distance between f and g is the maximum of |f(x) - g(x)| over the interval [-2, 2]. So, to minimize this maximum distance, we need to adjust 'a' such that the largest deviation between f(x) and g(x) is as small as possible.Let me write out the expression for |f(x) - g(x)|. Since both f and g are defined piecewise, maybe I can compute their difference and analyze it.First, f(x) = 2 - |x|, and g(x) = -a x² + 2. Therefore, f(x) - g(x) = [2 - |x|] - [-a x² + 2] = 2 - |x| + a x² - 2 = a x² - |x|.Therefore, |f(x) - g(x)| = |a x² - |x||. So the problem reduces to finding the value of 'a' that minimizes the maximum of |a x² - |x|| over x in [-2, 2].Since both functions are even functions (symmetric about the y-axis), because f(x) is even (due to the absolute value) and g(x) is even (since x² is even). Therefore, the absolute difference will also be even, so we can consider only the interval x ∈ [0, 2] and double whatever conclusions we get there. That simplifies things a bit.So let's restrict our analysis to x ≥ 0. Then |x| = x, so the expression becomes |a x² - x|. So we need to analyze this function h(x) = |a x² - x| on [0, 2], find its maximum, then find 'a' that minimizes this maximum.To minimize the maximum of h(x) over [0, 2], we need to adjust 'a' such that the peak of h(x) is as low as possible. This sounds like a problem in Chebyshev approximation, where you want to minimize the maximum deviation, which often leads to the equioscillation theorem. The theorem states that the optimal approximating function will have the error curve attaining its maximum absolute value at least n+1 times, where n is the number of parameters. In this case, since we're adjusting a single parameter 'a', the optimal solution should have at least two points in [0, 2] where the error is equal to the maximum, and the error alternates in sign between them. But since our error function is |a x² - x|, which is an absolute value, maybe the maximums occur at points where a x² - x is either positive or negative, but their absolute values are equal.Wait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step.First, let's analyze h(x) = |a x² - x|. Let's consider the function without the absolute value: k(x) = a x² - x. Then h(x) = |k(x)|. So we need to find the maximum of |k(x)| over [0, 2].To find the extrema of k(x), we can take the derivative of k(x) and set it to zero. However, since h(x) is the absolute value, the maximum of |k(x)| can occur either at critical points of k(x) where k(x) is positive or negative, or at points where k(x) = 0 (which are the points where the absolute value has a corner), or at the endpoints of the interval.But let's first analyze k(x) = a x² - x. Let's see where k(x) is positive or negative.Set k(x) = 0: a x² - x = 0 ⇒ x(a x - 1) = 0 ⇒ x = 0 or x = 1/a.So, the roots of k(x) are at x = 0 and x = 1/a.Since a is positive, 1/a is positive. So on the interval [0, 2], the roots are at x = 0 and x = 1/a. Depending on the value of 'a', x = 1/a could be inside [0, 2] or outside. If 1/a ≤ 2, that is, a ≥ 1/2, then the root is within [0, 2]. Otherwise, if a < 1/2, then 1/a > 2, so the root is outside the interval [0, 2].Therefore, for a ≥ 1/2, k(x) = a x² - x has two roots at x = 0 and x = 1/a. Between these roots, the sign of k(x) will be negative (since for a quadratic opening upwards, between the roots it's negative if a > 0). Wait, actually, k(x) is a quadratic function with a coefficient a on x². Since a is positive, it's a parabola opening upwards. Wait, but k(x) = a x² - x, so it's a parabola opening upwards. Then between the roots x=0 and x=1/a, the quadratic is below the x-axis (negative), and outside it's positive.But in our interval [0, 2], so for a ≥ 1/2, k(x) is negative between 0 and 1/a, and positive between 1/a and 2. For a < 1/2, k(x) is negative in all of [0, 2] since the other root is at x = 1/a > 2.Therefore, h(x) = |k(x)| is:- For a ≥ 1/2: h(x) = |a x² - x| = { -k(x) = x - a x² when 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/a; k(x) = a x² - x when 1/a ≤ x ≤ 2 }- For a < 1/2: h(x) = |a x² - x| = x - a x² for all x in [0, 2], since k(x) is negative there.Therefore, to find the maximum of h(x) over [0, 2], we need to analyze these cases.Case 1: a < 1/2. Then h(x) = x - a x² on [0, 2]. Let's find its maximum. The function h(x) = x - a x² is a downward-opening parabola (since coefficient of x² is -a < 0). Its maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, h(x) = -a x² + x + 0. So the vertex is at x = -1/(2*(-a)) = 1/(2a). Wait, that seems correct.Wait, h(x) = -a x² + x. So derivative h’(x) = -2a x + 1. Setting derivative to zero: -2a x + 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1/(2a). Since a < 1/2, 1/(2a) > 1/(2*(1/2)) = 1. So the vertex is at x = 1/(2a) > 1. Since the interval is up to x=2, we need to check if the vertex is within [0, 2]. Since a < 1/2, 1/(2a) > 1/(2*(1/2)) = 1, and since a is positive, 1/(2a) can be up to infinity as a approaches zero. So in this case, the maximum of h(x) occurs at x = 1/(2a) if that point is within [0, 2], but since a < 1/2, 1/(2a) > 1/(2*(1/2)) = 1, but it might be less than 2 or greater than 2.Wait, 1/(2a) < 2 ⇨ 1/(2a) < 2 ⇨ 1/(4) < a. So if a > 1/4, then 1/(2a) < 2. If a ≤ 1/4, then 1/(2a) ≥ 2.But in Case 1, a < 1/2. So we need to split Case 1 into two subcases:Case 1a: 1/4 < a < 1/2. Then 1/(2a) is between 1 and 2. So the maximum of h(x) occurs at x = 1/(2a). Then h(1/(2a)) = -a*(1/(2a))² + (1/(2a)) = -a*(1/(4a²)) + 1/(2a) = -1/(4a) + 1/(2a) = ( -1 + 2 ) / (4a ) = 1/(4a).Also, we need to check the endpoints. At x=0, h(0) = 0. At x=2, h(2) = 2 - a*(4) = 2 - 4a. So the maximum in this subcase is the maximum between 1/(4a) and 2 - 4a. Wait, but since we are in Case 1a: 1/4 < a < 1/2. Let's compute 1/(4a) and 2 - 4a:For a = 1/4, 1/(4a) = 1/(4*(1/4)) = 1, and 2 - 4a = 2 - 1 = 1. So at a=1/4, both are equal. For a approaching 1/2 from below, 1/(4a) approaches 1/(4*(1/2)) = 1/2, and 2 - 4a approaches 2 - 4*(1/2) = 0. So in between, 1/(4a) is decreasing from 1 to 1/2, and 2 - 4a is decreasing from 1 to 0. So the maximum of h(x) in this subcase is 1/(4a), which is larger than 2 - 4a.Therefore, for 1/4 < a < 1/2, the maximum is 1/(4a).Case 1b: a ≤ 1/4. Then the vertex at x=1/(2a) ≥ 2. Therefore, the maximum of h(x) occurs at x=2, since the parabola is decreasing from the vertex to the right. Wait, no. Wait, h(x) = x - a x². If the vertex is beyond x=2, then h(x) is increasing on [0, 2], because the parabola is opening downward, and the vertex is to the right of 2. Therefore, the maximum is at x=2. So h(2) = 2 - 4a. Also, check the value at x=1/(2a) which is outside the interval, so maximum is at x=2. Therefore, for a ≤ 1/4, the maximum is 2 - 4a.So summarizing Case 1 (a < 1/2):- If a ≤ 1/4, maximum of h(x) is 2 - 4a.- If 1/4 < a < 1/2, maximum is 1/(4a).Case 2: a ≥ 1/2. Then h(x) is defined as x - a x² on [0, 1/a] and a x² - x on [1/a, 2]. Let's analyze both pieces.First, on [0, 1/a], h(x) = x - a x². The maximum here occurs either at the critical point or at the endpoints. The critical point is again at x = 1/(2a). But since a ≥ 1/2, 1/(2a) ≤ 1/(2*(1/2)) = 1. But the interval here is [0, 1/a]. Since a ≥ 1/2, 1/a ≤ 2. Wait, but 1/(2a) compared to 1/a: 1/(2a) ≤ 1/a because a is positive. So 1/(2a) is within [0, 1/a]. Therefore, the maximum on [0, 1/a] occurs at x = 1/(2a), and the value is h(1/(2a)) = 1/(4a) as computed before.On the interval [1/a, 2], h(x) = a x² - x. Let's analyze this. The function is a x² - x, which is a parabola opening upwards (since a > 0). Therefore, it has a minimum at x = 1/(2a). However, the interval here is [1/a, 2]. Since the parabola opens upwards, on [1/a, 2], the function is increasing because the vertex is at x = 1/(2a) which is less than 1/a (since 1/(2a) < 1/a because a > 0). Therefore, on [1/a, 2], the function a x² - x is increasing. Therefore, the maximum on [1/a, 2] occurs at x=2. So h(2) = a*(4) - 2 = 4a - 2.So in Case 2 (a ≥ 1/2), the maximum of h(x) over [0,2] is the maximum between 1/(4a) (from the first piece) and 4a - 2 (from the second piece). Let's compare these two:At a = 1/2:1/(4a) = 1/(4*(1/2)) = 1/24a - 2 = 4*(1/2) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0So the maximum is 1/2.As a increases beyond 1/2, 1/(4a) decreases, and 4a - 2 increases. There might be a point where these two expressions are equal. Let's find if such a exists.Set 1/(4a) = 4a - 2.Multiply both sides by 4a:1 = 16a² - 8aBring all terms to one side:16a² - 8a - 1 = 0Solve for a:Using quadratic formula:a = [8 ± sqrt(64 + 64)] / 32 = [8 ± sqrt(128)] / 32 = [8 ± 8*sqrt(2)] / 32 = [1 ± sqrt(2)] / 4Since a is positive, we take the positive root:a = [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4 ≈ (1 + 1.4142)/4 ≈ 2.4142/4 ≈ 0.6035But [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4 is approximately 0.6035, which is greater than 1/2 (0.5). Therefore, in Case 2, when a ≥ 1/2, the two expressions 1/(4a) and 4a - 2 cross at a = [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4.Therefore, for a between 1/2 and [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4, 1/(4a) is greater than 4a - 2. For a greater than [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4, 4a - 2 becomes larger.Therefore, in Case 2:- For 1/2 ≤ a ≤ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4, the maximum of h(x) is 1/(4a).- For a ≥ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4, the maximum of h(x) is 4a - 2.So now, summarizing all cases:- For a ≤ 1/4: maximum is 2 - 4a.- For 1/4 < a < 1/2: maximum is 1/(4a).- For 1/2 ≤ a ≤ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4 ≈ 0.6035: maximum is 1/(4a).- For a ≥ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4: maximum is 4a - 2.Now, we need to find the value of 'a' that minimizes this maximum.Let's consider each interval and find the minimum in each.1. For a ≤ 1/4: maximum is 2 - 4a. This is a linear function decreasing as a increases. So the minimum in this interval occurs at the right endpoint a=1/4, giving 2 - 4*(1/4) = 2 - 1 = 1.2. For 1/4 < a < 1/2: maximum is 1/(4a). This is a decreasing function of 'a', since as 'a' increases, 1/(4a) decreases. So the minimum in this interval occurs at the right endpoint a=1/2, giving 1/(4*(1/2)) = 1/2.3. For 1/2 ≤ a ≤ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4: maximum is 1/(4a). Again, decreasing in 'a', so the minimum is at a=[1 + sqrt(2)] / 4, giving 1/(4*( [1 + sqrt(2)] /4 )) = 1/(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 0.4142.4. For a ≥ [1 + sqrt(2)] / 4: maximum is 4a - 2. This is an increasing function of 'a', so the minimum occurs at the left endpoint a=[1 + sqrt(2)] /4, giving 4*( [1 + sqrt(2)] /4 ) - 2 = [1 + sqrt(2)] - 2 = sqrt(2) -1 ≈ 0.4142.Therefore, the minimal maximum occurs at a=[1 + sqrt(2)] /4, where both expressions 1/(4a) and 4a -2 are equal to sqrt(2) -1 ≈ 0.4142.Therefore, the minimal maximum distance is sqrt(2) -1, achieved when a = [1 + sqrt(2)] /4.Therefore, the value of 'a' that minimizes the distance is (1 + sqrt(2))/4.But let me verify this conclusion.Wait, let's check at a = [1 + sqrt(2)] /4, the maximum is 4a - 2 = 4*(1 + sqrt(2))/4 - 2 = (1 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2) -1. Similarly, 1/(4a) = 1/(4*(1 + sqrt(2))/4) = 1/(1 + sqrt(2)) = (1 - sqrt(2))/ (1 - 2) ) = (sqrt(2) -1)/1 = sqrt(2) -1. So yes, both expressions give sqrt(2)-1. Therefore, at this value of 'a', the maximum in both intervals [0,1/a] and [1/a,2] is equal. That makes sense, per the equioscillation theorem, where the minimal maximum deviation is achieved when the maximum error is attained at multiple points with alternating signs, but in this case, since we have absolute value, perhaps it's attained at two points with the same value. In this case, the maximum occurs both at x=1/(2a) in the left interval and at x=2 in the right interval, both with the same maximum value. So that would satisfy the condition for minimal maximum.Therefore, this should be the optimal 'a'.But to ensure that there's no other point in the interval where the error is larger, let's check.Suppose a = [1 + sqrt(2)] /4 ≈ (1 + 1.4142)/4 ≈ 2.4142/4 ≈ 0.6035. Then, 1/a ≈ 1/0.6035 ≈ 1.656. So the split point between the two intervals is at x=1/a ≈ 1.656.In the interval [0, 1/a], the maximum is at x=1/(2a) ≈ 1/(2*0.6035) ≈ 0.828. The value there is sqrt(2)-1 ≈ 0.4142.In the interval [1/a, 2], the maximum is at x=2, which is 4a -2 ≈ 4*0.6035 -2 ≈ 2.414 -2 ≈ 0.414, same as above.Additionally, we need to check if there are any other local maxima in the interval. For example, in the interval [1/a, 2], the function h(x) = a x² -x is increasing, so its maximum is at x=2.In the interval [0,1/a], h(x) =x - a x² is a parabola opening downward with vertex at x=1/(2a). Since 1/(2a) ≈0.828 is within [0,1/a≈1.656], so the maximum is indeed at x=1/(2a).Therefore, the maximum of h(x) in [0,2] is sqrt(2)-1, achieved at x=1/(2a)≈0.828 and x=2. Thus, the minimal maximum is achieved when the two maxima are equal. Hence, the optimal 'a' is (1 + sqrt(2))/4.But let me check with an example. Let's take a = (1 + sqrt(2))/4 ≈ 0.6035. Compute h(x) at some points.At x=0: h(0)=0.At x=1/(2a) ≈0.828: h(x)=sqrt(2)-1≈0.4142.At x=1/a≈1.656: h(x)=0.At x=2: h(2)=4a -2≈0.4142.So between x=1/a and x=2, h(x) increases from 0 to 0.4142. Between x=0 and x=1/a, it peaks at 0.4142. Therefore, the maximum is indeed 0.4142, and occurs at two points. Therefore, this is the minimal maximum.Therefore, such an 'a' exists and is equal to (1 + sqrt(2))/4.Hence, the answer is a = (1 + sqrt(2))/4.Final AnswerThe value of (a) that minimizes the distance is (boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}}).</think>To find the value of (a) that minimizes the maximum distance between the functions (f(x) = 2 - |x|) and (g(x) = -ax^2 + 2) over the interval ([-2, 2]), we need to analyze the expression (|f(x) - g(x)|). This reduces to (|a x^2 - |x||).Given the symmetry of the functions, we consider the interval ([0, 2]). The expression simplifies to (|a x^2 - x|). We analyze the function (h(x) = |a x^2 - x|) and find the value of (a) that minimizes its maximum value over ([0, 2]).1. For (a leq frac{1}{4}):   - The maximum value of (h(x)) is (2 - 4a) at (x = 2).2. For (frac{1}{4} < a < frac{1}{2}):   - The maximum value of (h(x)) is (frac{1}{4a}) at (x = frac{1}{2a}).3. For (a geq frac{1}{2}):   - The function (h(x)) splits into two intervals: ([0, frac{1}{a}]) and ([frac{1}{a}, 2]).   - The maximum value on ([0, frac{1}{a}]) is (frac{1}{4a}) at (x = frac{1}{2a}).   - The maximum value on ([frac{1}{a}, 2]) is (4a - 2) at (x = 2).To find the optimal (a), we equate the maximum values from the intervals:- For (a geq frac{1}{2}), setting (frac{1}{4a} = 4a - 2) leads to solving the quadratic equation (16a^2 - 8a - 1 = 0). The positive root is (a = frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}).This value of (a) ensures that the maximum distance is minimized and occurs at two points, satisfying the equioscillation theorem. The optimal (a) is (frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}).[boxed{dfrac{1 + sqrt{2}}{4}}]]"},{"problem":"2.

So, we have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and we need to select 4 different numbers to fill in the four squares in this equation: □ + □ > □ + □. The question is asking how many different ways we can make this equation true. The hint says that 1+5>2+3 and 5+1>2+3 are considered different ways, so the order matters here. That means even if the same numbers are used but arranged differently, they count as separate cases. First, I need to understand how to approach this. Since we have to select 4 different numbers out of 5, we first need to choose which number to exclude. There are 5 choices for the number to exclude. Then, for each such choice, we need to arrange the remaining 4 numbers into the four squares, considering the order. However, the equation is about the sum of the first two numbers being greater than the sum of the last two. So, maybe we can approach this step by step: first, select the four numbers, then arrange them in such a way that the first two add up to more than the last two. But wait, since the exclusion of a number affects the possible combinations, maybe we should first consider all possible permutations of 4 numbers from the 5, and then check which permutations satisfy the inequality. Let me verify that. The total number of permutations of 4 numbers selected from 5 is 5P4 = 5*4*3*2 = 120. But since we have to exclude one number each time, and each permutation includes 4 distinct numbers, so each permutation corresponds to excluding one number. But in any case, there are 120 different ordered arrangements. Now, the problem is how many of these 120 permutations satisfy the condition that the sum of the first two numbers is greater than the sum of the last two.Alternatively, perhaps instead of considering permutations, we can think of the problem as first choosing which four numbers to use (by excluding one of the five), then arranging those four numbers in the four positions such that the first two add up to more than the last two. So maybe break it down into cases based on which number is excluded, then for each case, compute the number of valid permutations.Let me try that approach. Let's consider each possible excluded number: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. For each exclusion, we have the remaining four numbers. Then, we need to arrange these four numbers into the four positions (two on the left side of the inequality and two on the right side) such that the sum of the left two is greater than the sum of the right two. Since order matters, each permutation is unique. So for each excluded number, we can calculate the number of permutations where the left sum exceeds the right sum, then sum over all excluded numbers.But this might be complicated because each exclusion leads to different numbers, so the possible sums would vary. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that excluding different numbers might lead to symmetrical situations. For example, if we exclude 1, the numbers are 2,3,4,5; excluding 5 gives 1,2,3,4. Maybe these two cases are similar? Not sure. Let's try to work through each case.Case 1: Excluding 1. So the numbers available are 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, we need to arrange these four numbers into the four positions. The total number of permutations is 4! = 24. For each permutation, the first two numbers form the left sum, and the last two form the right sum. We need to count how many times left sum > right sum.But calculating this directly for each permutation would be tedious. Instead, perhaps we can find a smarter way. For four numbers a, b, c, d, when arranged as a + b > c + d. Since all permutations are considered, the positions of the numbers matter. So, given four distinct numbers, how many of the 24 permutations satisfy the inequality? Wait, but for four distinct numbers, the sum a + b can range from the smallest possible sum to the largest. For example, with numbers 2,3,4,5: the smallest possible sum of two numbers is 2 + 3 = 5, and the largest is 4 + 5 = 9. The total number of ordered pairs for the left side is 4P2 = 12 (since order matters), and similarly for the right side, the remaining two numbers would form the right sum. Wait, but actually, once you choose the first two numbers, the last two are determined. So for each permutation, the first two are selected in order, and the last two are in order. So in total, the number of possible arrangements is 4! = 24, as each permutation is unique.However, for each unique combination of left pair and right pair, there are multiple permutations. For example, if the left pair is 2 and 3, and the right pair is 4 and 5, then the permutations could be 2,3,4,5 or 2,3,5,4, etc. But the sum of the left pair is 5, and the sum of the right pair is 9, so 5 > 9 is false. Conversely, if the left pair is 5 and 4, the sum is 9, and the right pair is 2 and 3, sum is 5, so 9 > 5 is true. But in how many permutations does the left sum exceed the right sum?Wait, perhaps another approach: For four numbers, the total number of ways to split them into two ordered pairs is 4! / (2! * 2!) ) * 2! * 2! = 6 * 4 = 24, but that's the same as 4! So, each permutation corresponds to a unique split. So, to count how many permutations satisfy left sum > right sum, we can consider all possible splits into left and right pairs, and count how many of those splits have the left sum greater.But how many distinct splits are there where the left sum is greater than the right sum? Let's think in terms of combinations. For four numbers a, b, c, d, the number of distinct ways to choose two numbers for the left (without order) is C(4,2) = 6. For each such combination, the left sum can be compared to the right sum. However, since order matters in the permutation, each combination can be arranged in 2! ways for the left pair and 2! ways for the right pair, totaling 4 ways per combination.Therefore, for each combination of left pair, there are 4 permutations corresponding to it. So, if a particular combination of left pair has a sum greater than the right pair, then all 4 permutations corresponding to that combination will satisfy the inequality, and vice versa. Similarly, if the sums are equal, none will satisfy. But since all numbers are distinct, the sums can't be equal. Wait, can they?Wait, let's check. If the left pair sum equals the right pair sum, that would require two different pairs of numbers to have the same sum. For example, in numbers 1,2,3,4: 1+4=2+3=5. So, in such a case, the sum is equal, so the inequality is not satisfied. But in our case, when excluding a number, the remaining numbers might or might not have such pairs.Wait, but in the first case, when excluding 1, the numbers are 2,3,4,5. Let's check if any two pairs add up to the same sum. Let's see:Possible pairs:2+3=5, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9.So, pairs (2,5) and (3,4) both sum to 7. Therefore, if the left pair is (2,5) and the right pair is (3,4), then the sum is equal. Similarly, left pair (3,4) and right pair (2,5) also sum to 7. So, in this case, even though the numbers are distinct, the sums can be equal. So, for these combinations, the inequality is not satisfied. Therefore, when we have combinations where the left sum equals the right sum, those permutations would not count. So, in this case, for numbers 2,3,4,5, we have two pairs that sum to 7. Therefore, the combinations (2,5 vs 3,4) and (3,4 vs 2,5) will each have sum equal to 7. Each combination can be arranged in 4 permutations (since left pair can be ordered in 2 ways, right pair in 2 ways). Therefore, there are 2 combinations * 4 permutations = 8 permutations where the sum is equal. So, out of 24 permutations, 8 result in equal sums, and the remaining 16 permutations will have either left sum > right sum or left sum < right sum. Since for the other combinations, the sums are unequal, and each combination where left sum > right sum is balanced by the reverse where left sum < right sum. Therefore, the number of permutations where left sum > right sum is equal to the number where left sum < right sum. So, subtracting the 8 equal permutations, we have 16 permutations left, which split evenly into 8 where left > right and 8 where left < right. Therefore, in this case (excluding 1), the number of valid permutations is 8.But wait, let's verify this. Let's take numbers 2,3,4,5.Total permutations: 24.Number of permutations where the sum of the first two equals the sum of the last two: As we saw, the pairs (2,5) and (3,4) sum to 7. Each of these pairs can be arranged in 2*2=4 ways. But how many permutations does this correspond to?For the combination where the first two numbers are 2 and 5 (in any order) and the last two are 3 and 4 (in any order). There are 2 (for 2 and 5) * 2 (for 3 and 4) = 4 permutations: 2,5,3,4; 2,5,4,3; 5,2,3,4; 5,2,4,3. Similarly, for the combination where the first two are 3 and 4 and the last two are 2 and 5, we have another 4 permutations: 3,4,2,5; 3,4,5,2; 4,3,2,5; 4,3,5,2. So total 8 permutations where the sum is equal. Therefore, remaining permutations: 24 - 8 = 16. These 16 must be split equally between left sum > right sum and left sum < right sum. Therefore, 8 permutations where left sum > right sum. So, for case 1 (excluding 1), there are 8 valid permutations.Case 2: Excluding 2. The remaining numbers are 1,3,4,5. Let's perform a similar analysis. First, check if there are any pairs that sum to the same value.Possible pairs:1+3=4, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9. So, all sums are unique here. Therefore, there are no pairs that sum to the same value. Therefore, in this case, when splitting the four numbers into two pairs, the sums will always be different. Therefore, for each permutation, either left sum > right sum or left sum < right sum. Since there are 24 permutations, and each split is either left or right, the number of permutations where left sum > right sum should be half of 24, which is 12. Wait, but this is only true if each combination is equally likely to be left or right. But since we are dealing with permutations, each split is unique. However, for each combination of left pair and right pair, there are 2! permutations for the left pair and 2! for the right pair, so 4 permutations per combination. Since the sums are all different, for each combination, either left sum > right sum or vice versa, and since there are C(4,2)=6 combinations, each leading to 4 permutations, so 6*4=24. Since each combination is either left > right or left < right, and there are 6 combinations. Let's check how many of the combinations have left sum > right sum.For numbers 1,3,4,5:Possible left pairs (sum):1+3=4; right pair sum would be 4+5=9. 4 < 9, so left sum < right sum.1+4=5; right pair sum: 3+5=8. 5 < 8, left < right.1+5=6; right pair sum: 3+4=7. 6 < 7, left < right.3+4=7; right pair sum:1+5=6. 7 > 6, left > right.3+5=8; right pair sum:1+4=5. 8 > 5, left > right.4+5=9; right pair sum:1+3=4. 9 > 4, left > right.So out of the 6 combinations, 3 result in left sum > right sum (the last three combinations). Each of these 3 combinations can be arranged in 4 permutations (since order matters). Therefore, the number of permutations where left sum > right sum is 3 * 4 = 12. Therefore, in case 2 (excluding 2), there are 12 valid permutations.Case 3: Excluding 3. The remaining numbers are 1,2,4,5. Let's check for equal sums.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 4+5=9. Here, pairs (1,5) and (2,4) both sum to 6. So similar to case 1, we have two pairs that sum to 6. Therefore, the combinations where left pair is (1,5) and right pair is (2,4) or vice versa will have equal sums.So, how many permutations does that correspond to? For each combination, left pair ordered in 2 ways, right pair ordered in 2 ways, so 4 permutations each. Since there are two such combinations (left pair (1,5) vs (2,4) and left pair (2,4) vs (1,5)), total 8 permutations with equal sums. Therefore, remaining permutations: 24 - 8 = 16. These split equally into 8 permutations where left sum > right sum and 8 where left sum < right sum. Therefore, case 3 (excluding 3) gives 8 valid permutations.Case 4: Excluding 4. Remaining numbers: 1,2,3,5. Let's check for equal sums.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+5=6, 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+5=8. All sums here are unique. So no pairs that sum to the same value. Therefore, similar to case 2, we can calculate the number of valid permutations.Total permutations: 24. Let's check the combinations:Possible left pairs (sum):1+2=3; right sum:3+5=8. Left < right.1+3=4; right sum:2+5=7. Left < right.1+5=6; right sum:2+3=5. Left > right.2+3=5; right sum:1+5=6. Left < right.2+5=7; right sum:1+3=4. Left > right.3+5=8; right sum:1+2=3. Left > right.So out of 6 combinations, 3 result in left sum > right sum (last three: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)). Each of these combinations can be arranged in 4 permutations, so 3*4=12. Therefore, case 4 (excluding 4) gives 12 valid permutations.Case 5: Excluding 5. Remaining numbers: 1,2,3,4. Let's check for equal sums. As mentioned earlier, pairs (1,4) and (2,3) both sum to 5. So similar to case 1 and 3.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7. So pairs (1,4) and (2,3) sum to 5. Therefore, permutations where the left pair is (1,4) and right pair is (2,3) or vice versa will have equal sums. Each combination can be arranged in 4 permutations, so total 8 permutations with equal sums. Therefore, remaining permutations: 24 - 8 = 16. Split equally into 8 left > right and 8 left < right. Therefore, case 5 (excluding 5) gives 8 valid permutations.Now, summing up all cases:Case 1 (exclude 1): 8Case 2 (exclude 2): 12Case 3 (exclude 3): 8Case 4 (exclude 4): 12Case 5 (exclude 5): 8Total: 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 48Therefore, there are 48 different ways to make the equation true.Wait, let me check if that makes sense. Total permutations of 4 numbers from 5 is 5P4 = 120. So, if the answer is 48, then 48 out of 120 permutations satisfy the condition. That's 40%. Alternatively, when we broke down each case, for each exclusion, we got either 8 or 12. Since there are two exclusions leading to 12 (excluding 2 and 4) and three exclusions leading to 8 (excluding 1,3,5). Wait, no, actually, when excluding 2 and 4, which are middle numbers, maybe there's more possible permutations where left sum exceeds right sum because the numbers are spread out more. While when excluding extremes (1,3,5), you have overlapping pairs that sum the same. So, the counts make sense.But let's verify with another approach. Let's think of all possible 4-number combinations. Each time we exclude one number, the remaining numbers have certain properties, but the key is that in some cases there are pairs that sum equally, and in others not. So, when excluding 2 or 4, which are middle numbers, the remaining numbers don't have such equal pairs, leading to more valid permutations. When excluding 1,3, or 5, which are the extremes, there are pairs that sum equally, reducing the number of valid permutations.Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula or symmetry here. But given that we have 5 cases, each with different counts, adding up to 48. Let me check again.Case 1: 8Case2: 12Case3:8Case4:12Case5:8Total: 8+12+8+12+8 = 48. Yes, that's correct.But just to be thorough, let's check with a smaller example. For example, take numbers 1,2,3,4. Let's say we want to compute the number of permutations where the first two numbers sum > the last two. Let's compute this manually.Numbers 1,2,3,4. Total permutations:24.Possible pairs:Possible left pairs:1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+1=3, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+1=4, 3+2=5, 3+4=7, 4+1=5, 4+2=6, 4+3=7.But actually, it's easier to split into combinations. The pairs (1,2) sum to 3, (1,3)=4, (1,4)=5, (2,3)=5, (2,4)=6, (3,4)=7.So, comparing each left pair sum to the corresponding right pair sum:Left pair (1,2): sum 3 vs right pair (3,4): sum 7. Left < right. So all permutations with left pair (1,2) in any order and right pair (3,4) in any order: 4 permutations. These are invalid.Left pair (1,3): sum 4 vs right pair (2,4): sum 6. Left < right. 4 permutations, invalid.Left pair (1,4): sum 5 vs right pair (2,3): sum 5. Equal, so invalid. 4 permutations.Left pair (2,3): sum 5 vs right pair (1,4): sum 5. Equal, invalid. 4 permutations.Left pair (2,4): sum 6 vs right pair (1,3): sum 4. Left > right. 4 permutations, valid.Left pair (3,4): sum 7 vs right pair (1,2): sum 3. Left > right. 4 permutations, valid.So total valid permutations: 4 (from 2,4) + 4 (from 3,4) = 8. Which matches our earlier calculation when excluding 5 (since numbers 1,2,3,4 exclude 5, and we found 8 permutations). So that's correct. Similarly, if we take numbers 1,3,4,5 (excluding 2), the valid permutations are 12. Let me check one combination:Left pair (3,4): sum 7 vs right pair (1,5): sum 6. Left > right. So permutations like 3,4,1,5; 4,3,1,5; 3,4,5,1; 4,3,5,1; etc. Each combination contributes 4 permutations, and we had 3 such combinations (3,4;3,5;4,5). Each gives 4 permutations, so 3*4=12. That seems correct.Therefore, the total of 48 seems plausible.But let me check another way. The total number of permutations is 120. Each permutation either has left sum > right, left sum < right, or left sum = right. But when can left sum = right sum?In the entire 120 permutations, how many have left sum = right sum? For each exclusion case, we had some permutations with equal sums. For example, when excluding 1,3,5, there were 8 permutations each with equal sums, and when excluding 2,4, there were none. So total equal permutations: 3 cases * 8 = 24. Therefore, total permutations where left sum = right sum:24. Therefore, remaining permutations:120 -24=96. These should be equally split between left sum > right and left sum < right. So 48 each. Therefore, answer is 48. Which matches our previous calculation.Therefore, the correct answer is 48.Final Answerboxed{48}</think>To solve the problem of determining how many different ways we can make the equation square + square > square + square true by selecting 4 different numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we need to consider each possible excluded number and calculate the valid permutations for each case.1.

Excluding 5: The remaining numbers are {1, 2, 3, 4}. The pairs (1, 4) and (2, 3) sum to 5, leading to 8 permutations with equal sums. The remaining 16 permutations split evenly, resulting in 8 valid permutations.Summing up all valid permutations:- Case 1 (excluding 1): 8- Case 2 (excluding 2): 12- Case 3 (excluding 3): 8- Case 4 (excluding 4): 12- Case 5 (excluding 5): 8Total valid permutations: 8 + 12 + 8 + 12 + 8 = 48.Thus, the number of different ways to make the equation true is boxed{48}.,<think>Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how many different ways we can select 4 different numbers from 1,2,3,4,5 and arrange them in the equation: □ + □ > □ + □. Each arrangement where the sum of the first two numbers is greater than the sum of the last two counts as a valid way, and different orders are considered different even if they use the same numbers. For example, 1+5>2+3 and 5+1>2+3 are different. First, I need to figure out all possible ways to choose 4 numbers out of the 5 given. Since we have to use 4 different numbers, and the original set is 1,2,3,4,5, the number of combinations is C(5,4) which is 5. Each combination is missing one number. The combinations would be:1. Missing 1: {2,3,4,5}2. Missing 2: {1,3,4,5}3. Missing 3: {1,2,4,5}4. Missing 4: {1,2,3,5}5. Missing 5: {1,2,3,4}For each of these combinations, we need to consider all permutations of the 4 numbers into the four boxes. Each permutation is a different way. However, since the problem is about the inequality a + b > c + d, the order of a and b matters, as well as the order of c and d. But wait, actually, even if we swap a and b, the sum remains the same. Wait, but the problem says that different arrangements are considered different even if the sums are the same. For example, 1+5>2+3 and 5+1>2+3 are different. So even though the left side is the same sum, the arrangement is different because the numbers are swapped. Therefore, the order matters for the individual numbers, not just the sums.Therefore, for each combination of 4 numbers, the total number of arrangements is 4! = 24. But since there are 5 combinations, the total number of possible arrangements is 5 * 24 = 120. However, many of these will satisfy the inequality a + b > c + d, and we need to count how many do.But maybe instead of brute-forcing through all 120 possibilities, we can find a smarter way. Let's think about the possible sums. The maximum possible sum of two numbers from 1-5 is 5 + 4 = 9, and the minimum is 1 + 2 = 3. The sum of the other two numbers would be the total of the four numbers minus the first sum. So, for a given combination of four numbers, the total sum is fixed. Let's denote the four numbers as w, x, y, z, sorted in ascending order. Then, the total sum S = w + x + y + z. Then, if we pick two numbers a and b, their sum is s, and the sum of the remaining two is S - s. So the inequality a + b > c + d is equivalent to s > S - s, which simplifies to 2s > S, or s > S/2.Therefore, for each combination of four numbers, we can compute S, then determine how many pairs (a,b) have a sum greater than S/2. Then, since each such pair (a,b) can be arranged in 2 ways (a,b and b,a), and the remaining pair (c,d) can be arranged in 2 ways as well (c,d and d,c), each such pair contributes 2*2=4 arrangements. Therefore, for each combination, the number of valid arrangements is 4 * number of pairs (a,b) with sum > S/2.Alternatively, for each combination, we can compute how many ordered pairs (a,b) satisfy a + b > c + d, considering all permutations.But maybe let's proceed step by step.First, let's analyze each combination of four numbers.Combination 1: Missing 1: {2,3,4,5}Total sum S = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14Therefore, S/2 = 7. So we need pairs (a,b) such that a + b > 7.Possible pairs from 2,3,4,5:2+3=5, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9.So sums: 5,6,7,7,8,9. The pairs with sum >7 are 8 and 9. So the pairs (3,5), (4,5). Each of these pairs contributes 4 arrangements (since a,b can be ordered 2 ways and c,d can be ordered 2 ways). Wait, but how many such pairs are there? Let's see:The unordered pairs that sum to >7: (3,5), (4,5). So two unordered pairs. Each unordered pair can be arranged in 2 ways (a,b and b,a). Similarly, the remaining two numbers form an unordered pair, which can be arranged in 2 ways. Therefore, for each unordered pair (a,b) that sums to >7, there are 2 * 2 =4 ordered arrangements.So total valid arrangements for this combination: 2 unordered pairs * 4 = 8.Wait, but let's check:For pair (3,5):Possible arrangements for (a,b): (3,5) and (5,3)The remaining numbers are 2 and 4, which can be arranged as (2,4) or (4,2). So for each (a,b), there are 2 possibilities for (c,d). Therefore, 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements for the pair (3,5). Similarly for pair (4,5):Arrangements (4,5) and (5,4). Remaining numbers 2 and 3. So (2,3) and (3,2). So again 4 arrangements. So total 4 + 4 =8.So 8 valid arrangements for combination 1.Combination 2: Missing 2: {1,3,4,5}Total sum S =1 +3 +4 +5=13S/2=6.5. So pairs (a,b) with sum >6.5, which means sum >=7.Possible pairs from 1,3,4,5:1+3=4, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 3+4=7, 3+5=8, 4+5=9.Sums: 4,5,6,7,8,9. So pairs with sum >=7: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). That's three unordered pairs.For each of these:(3,4): arrangements (3,4) and (4,3). Remaining numbers 1 and5, arranged as (1,5) and (5,1). So 2*2=4.(3,5): arrangements (3,5) and (5,3). Remaining numbers 1 and4: 2*2=4.(4,5): arrangements (4,5) and (5,4). Remaining numbers 1 and3: 2*2=4.Total: 3 unordered pairs *4=12 arrangements.Therefore, combination 2 has 12 valid arrangements.Combination3: Missing3: {1,2,4,5}Sum S=1+2+4+5=12S/2=6. So pairs (a,b) with sum >6.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+5=6, 2+4=6, 2+5=7, 4+5=9.Sums:3,5,6,6,7,9. So pairs with sum >6: (2,5), (4,5). That's two unordered pairs.For (2,5):Arrangements (2,5) and (5,2). Remaining numbers 1 and4: 2*2=4.For (4,5):Arrangements (4,5) and (5,4). Remaining numbers 1 and2: 2*2=4.Total: 2*4=8 arrangements.Combination3: 8 valid arrangements.Combination4: Missing4: {1,2,3,5}Sum S=1+2+3+5=11S/2=5.5. So pairs (a,b) with sum >5.5, i.e., >=6.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+5=6, 2+3=5, 2+5=7, 3+5=8.Sums:3,4,6,5,7,8. So sums >=6: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). Three unordered pairs.For (1,5):Arrangements (1,5) and (5,1). Remaining numbers 2 and3: 2*2=4.For (2,5):Arrangements (2,5) and (5,2). Remaining numbers 1 and3: 2*2=4.For (3,5):Arrangements (3,5) and (5,3). Remaining numbers 1 and2: 2*2=4.Total:3*4=12 arrangements.Combination4:12 valid arrangements.Combination5: Missing5: {1,2,3,4}Sum S=1+2+3+4=10S/2=5. So pairs (a,b) with sum >5.Possible pairs:1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7.Sums:3,4,5,5,6,7. So pairs with sum >5: (2,4), (3,4). Two unordered pairs.For (2,4):Arrangements (2,4) and (4,2). Remaining numbers 1 and3: 2*2=4.For (3,4):Arrangements (3,4) and (4,3). Remaining numbers 1 and2: 2*2=4.Total:2*4=8 arrangements.Combination5:8 valid arrangements.Now, adding up all the valid arrangements for each combination:Combination1:8Combination2:12Combination3:8Combination4:12Combination5:8Total:8+12=20, 20+8=28, 28+12=40, 40+8=48.Wait, 8+12 is 20, then +8 is 28, +12 is 40, +8 is 48. So total 48 different ways.But wait, let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.Combination1:8Combination2:12 → 8+12=20Combination3:8 → 20+8=28Combination4:12 →28+12=40Combination5:8 →40+8=48.Yes, 48.But wait, let me verify with another approach. Because each combination of 4 numbers, when considering all permutations, has 4! =24 permutations. For each permutation, the first two numbers are a and b, the last two are c and d. The inequality a + b > c + d. How many of the 24 permutations satisfy this?Alternatively, for each combination, the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b > c + d. Note that for each permutation, (a,b,c,d), the inequality is a + b > c + d. But the same four numbers can be arranged in different ways. However, the sum a + b can range over different values. For each combination, how many ordered pairs (a,b) have sum greater than the sum of the remaining two numbers.But since the total sum S is fixed, the sum a + b must be greater than (S - (a + b)), so as before, 2(a + b) > S, so a + b > S/2. Therefore, for each combination, the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b > S/2. The number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a and b are distinct elements of the combination. The number of ordered pairs is 4*3=12 for each combination (since we choose two distinct numbers, order matters). So for each combination, out of 12 ordered pairs (a,b), how many satisfy a + b > S/2. Then, once (a,b) is chosen, the remaining two numbers can be ordered in 2 ways (c,d and d,c). Therefore, for each valid (a,b), there are 2 permutations. So total valid permutations for each combination is 2 * number of valid (a,b) ordered pairs.Wait, but let me check.Suppose in a combination, we have numbers w, x, y, z. The number of ordered pairs (a,b) is 4*3=12. For each of these, if a + b > S/2, then we can arrange the remaining two numbers as (c,d) in 2 ways, so total 2 permutations per valid (a,b). Therefore, total valid permutations for the combination would be 2 * (number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b > S/2).Alternatively, since (a,b,c,d) is a permutation, the total number is 4! =24. But if we fix (a,b), then (c,d) is determined as the remaining two numbers, and can be ordered in 2 ways. So the number of permutations where a + b > c + d is equal to the number of ordered pairs (a,b) with a + b > S/2 multiplied by 2.Therefore, to compute for each combination, compute the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b > S/2, multiply by 2, and sum over all combinations.Let's see if this aligns with our previous calculations.Take combination1: {2,3,4,5}, S=14, S/2=7.Number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b >7:Possible ordered pairs:(3,5)=8, (5,3)=8, (4,5)=9, (5,4)=9, (4,3)=7, (3,4)=7, (5,2)=7, (2,5)=7, etc.Wait, actually, to compute the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b >7.List all ordered pairs (a,b) where a and b are distinct elements of {2,3,4,5}:(2,3)=5, (2,4)=6, (2,5)=7,(3,2)=5, (3,4)=7, (3,5)=8,(4,2)=6, (4,3)=7, (4,5)=9,(5,2)=7, (5,3)=8, (5,4)=9.Now, sums greater than 7: sums of 8,9.So:(3,5)=8, (4,5)=9, (5,3)=8, (5,4)=9, (4,5)=9, (5,4)=9. Wait, no:Wait, let's list all 12 ordered pairs and their sums:1. (2,3)=52. (2,4)=63. (2,5)=74. (3,2)=55. (3,4)=76. (3,5)=87. (4,2)=68. (4,3)=79. (4,5)=910. (5,2)=711. (5,3)=812. (5,4)=9Now, sums >7 are:6. (3,5)=89. (4,5)=911. (5,3)=812. (5,4)=9So that's 4 ordered pairs. Therefore, number of valid ordered pairs (a,b) is 4. Then, the number of permutations is 4 * 2 =8, which matches our previous calculation. So for combination1, 8 permutations.Similarly, combination2: {1,3,4,5}, S=13, S/2=6.5.Compute ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b >6.5:List all 12 ordered pairs:1. (1,3)=42. (1,4)=53. (1,5)=64. (3,1)=45. (3,4)=76. (3,5)=87. (4,1)=58. (4,3)=79. (4,5)=910. (5,1)=611. (5,3)=812. (5,4)=9Sums >6.5 are sums >=7:5. (3,4)=76. (3,5)=88. (4,3)=79. (4,5)=911. (5,3)=812. (5,4)=9That's 6 ordered pairs. Therefore, number of permutations is 6 *2=12, which matches combination2's 12.Similarly, combination3: {1,2,4,5}, S=12, S/2=6.Ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b >6:List:1. (1,2)=32. (1,4)=53. (1,5)=64. (2,1)=35. (2,4)=66. (2,5)=77. (4,1)=58. (4,2)=69. (4,5)=910. (5,1)=611. (5,2)=712. (5,4)=9Sums >6: 7,9,7,9. The ordered pairs are:6. (2,5)=79. (4,5)=911. (5,2)=712. (5,4)=9Total 4 ordered pairs. So permutations:4*2=8, matches combination3.Combination4: {1,2,3,5}, S=11, S/2=5.5.Ordered pairs (a,b) with a + b >5.5 (i.e., >=6):List:1. (1,2)=32. (1,3)=43. (1,5)=64. (2,1)=35. (2,3)=56. (2,5)=77. (3,1)=48. (3,2)=59. (3,5)=810. (5,1)=611. (5,2)=712. (5,3)=8Sums >=6:3. (1,5)=66. (2,5)=79. (3,5)=810. (5,1)=611. (5,2)=712. (5,3)=8That's 6 ordered pairs. So permutations:6*2=12, matches combination4.Combination5: {1,2,3,4}, S=10, S/2=5.Ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b >5:List:1. (1,2)=32. (1,3)=43. (1,4)=54. (2,1)=35. (2,3)=56. (2,4)=67. (3,1)=48. (3,2)=59. (3,4)=710. (4,1)=511. (4,2)=612. (4,3)=7Sums >5:6,5,6,7,5,6,7. Wait:Specifically:6. (2,4)=69. (3,4)=711. (4,2)=612. (4,3)=7That's 4 ordered pairs. Therefore, permutations:4*2=8, matches combination5.So all combinations check out with both methods: counting unordered pairs and multiplying by 4, and counting ordered pairs and multiplying by 2. Therefore, total is indeed 8+12+8+12+8=48.Therefore, the answer should be 48 different ways.But wait, let me just verify with another approach. Since each combination of 4 numbers contributes some number of valid permutations, and there are 5 combinations, each with 24 permutations (total 120), and we found 48 of them satisfy the inequality. Is 48/120=0.4, which is 40%. That seems plausible. But let's think if there's another way to compute it.Alternatively, for any four distinct numbers, when arranging them as a + b > c + d, how many such arrangements exist.But since the numbers are distinct, the sum a + b can be compared to the sum c + d. For four distinct numbers, the total number of ways to split them into two pairs is 3: since the number of ways to partition 4 elements into two pairs is 3. However, since order matters here (both in the pairs and the order within the pairs), it's different.Alternatively, the total number of permutations of four numbers is 24. For each permutation, the first two positions are a and b, and the last two are c and d. The number of permutations where a + b > c + d.But for any four distinct numbers, the number of permutations where the first two sum to more than the last two should be equal to the number of permutations where the last two sum to more than the first two, plus the cases where they are equal. But since all numbers are distinct, the sums a + b and c + d can be equal only if the pairs are different but sum to the same. However, since the total sum S is fixed, if a + b = c + d, then 2(a + b) = S, so a + b = S/2. Therefore, the number of permutations where a + b = c + d is equal to the number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b = S/2 multiplied by 2 (for the two orderings of c and d). But since S must be even for there to be such pairs.In our problem, each combination has a certain S. For combinations where S is even, there might be permutations where a + b = c + d, but in our previous counts, we only considered a + b > c + d. Therefore, the total number of permutations for a combination is equal to the number where a + b > c + d plus the number where a + b < c + d plus the number where a + b = c + d. But since we are only counting the cases where a + b > c + d, the number should be (total permutations - number of equal cases)/2, assuming that when a + b ≠ c + d, they split evenly between > and <.But let's check for combination1: S=14 (even). Number of permutations where a + b =7. The ordered pairs (a,b) where a + b=7 are (2,5) and (5,2), (3,4) and (4,3). So there are 4 ordered pairs where sum=7. Each such ordered pair corresponds to permutations where a + b =7 and c + d=7. For each of these 4 ordered pairs, the remaining two numbers can be arranged in 2 ways, so total permutations with a + b = c + d is 4*2=8. Total permutations for combination1 is24. Therefore, permutations where a + b ≠ c + d is24 -8=16. Therefore, permutations where a + b >c +d is16/2=8, which matches our previous count. So this method works.Similarly, for combination2: S=13 (odd). So there are no permutations where a + b =c + d, because S is odd. Therefore, total permutations where a + b >c +d is24/2=12, which matches.Combination3: S=12 (even). The permutations where a + b =6. The ordered pairs (a,b) that sum to6 are (1,5),(5,1),(2,4),(4,2). Each of these 4 ordered pairs, and remaining numbers arranged in2 ways. So total permutations with a + b =c +d is4*2=8. Therefore, permutations where a + b ≠c +d is24-8=16, so a + b >c +d is8, which matches.Combination4:S=11 (odd). Therefore, all permutations are either a + b >c +d or a + b <c +d, equally, so 12 each. Which matches our count of12.Combination5:S=10 (even). The permutations where a + b =5. The ordered pairs (a,b) that sum to5 are (1,4),(4,1),(2,3),(3,2). So4 ordered pairs, each with remaining numbers arranged in2 ways. So total permutations with a + b =c +d is4*2=8. Therefore, permutations where a + b ≠c +d is16, so a + b >c +d is8, which matches.Therefore, using this method, we can calculate for each combination:For even S: permutations with a + b >c +d is (24 - E)/2, where E is the number of permutations with a + b =c +d.For odd S: permutations with a + b >c +d is12.Where E= number of ordered pairs (a,b) with a + b =S/2 multiplied by 2.But we already saw that this gives the same counts as before.Therefore, the total number of valid permutations is:For combinations with even S:(24 - E)/2For combinations with odd S:12Now, let's compute E for each combination:Combination1: S=14 (even). S/2=7. Number of ordered pairs (a,b) with sum7: (2,5),(5,2),(3,4),(4,3). So 4 ordered pairs. Therefore, E=4*2=8. Therefore, valid permutations=(24-8)/2=8.Combination2:S=13 (odd). E=0. Valid permutations=12.Combination3:S=12 (even). S/2=6. Ordered pairs (a,b) with sum6: (1,5),(5,1),(2,4),(4,2). 4 ordered pairs. E=8. Valid permutations= (24-8)/2=8.Combination4:S=11 (odd). Valid permutations=12.Combination5:S=10 (even). S/2=5. Ordered pairs (a,b) with sum5: (1,4),(4,1),(2,3),(3,2). 4 ordered pairs. E=8. Valid permutations=(24-8)/2=8.So same counts. Therefore, total permutations=8+12+8+12+8=48.Therefore, the answer is48 different ways.But wait, the problem says \\"select 4 different numbers to fill in the 4 squares\\". So the numbers have to be selected from the 5, and then arranged. So our method is correct: considering all combinations of 4 numbers and all permutations. And total valid ways is48.Therefore, the answer is boxed{48}.</think>To determine the number of different ways to arrange 4 numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} such that the equation (square + square > square + square) holds true, we need to consider each combination of 4 numbers and count the valid permutations for each combination.1.

First, we recognize that the properties of exponents allow us to manipulate the given equations in useful ways. Specifically, we can use the fact that a^{b-c} = frac{a^b}{a^c} and (a^b)^c = a^{bc} for any real numbers a, b, and c. Starting with the expression 3^{m-2n}, we apply these properties as follows:[3^{m-2n} = 3^{m} div 3^{2n} = 3^{m} div (3^{n})^{2}]Substituting the given values for 3^{m} and 3^{n}, we get:[3^{m-2n} = 4 div 5^{2}]Since 5^2 = 25, this simplifies to:[3^{m-2n} = frac{4}{25}]Therefore, the value of 3^{m-2n} is boxed{frac{4}{25}}.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I have this problem here: If 3^m = 4 and 3^n = 5, then what is the value of 3^{m-2n}? Hmm, let me see. I need to figure out 3 raised to the power of (m minus 2n). Alright, let's start by recalling some exponent rules because I think that will help here. First, I remember that when you have exponents with the same base and you're subtracting in the exponent, like a^{b - c}, that can be rewritten as a^b divided by a^c. So maybe 3^{m - 2n} is the same as 3^m divided by 3^{2n}? Let me check that. Yeah, the rule is a^{b - c} = a^b / a^c. So that part seems right.So, applying that here, 3^{m - 2n} = 3^m / 3^{2n}. Now, I already know that 3^m is 4, from the problem statement. So substituting that in, that gives me 4 divided by 3^{2n}. But what is 3^{2n}?Hmm, 3^{2n} can be written as (3^n)^2, right? Because when you have a power raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. So (3^n)^2 is 3^{n*2} = 3^{2n}. That makes sense. And from the problem, we know that 3^n = 5. So substituting that in, (3^n)^2 becomes 5^2, which is 25. So 3^{2n} = 25.So going back to the previous expression, 3^{m - 2n} = 3^m / 3^{2n} = 4 / 25. Wait, that seems straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?Let me just verify each step again. Starting with the exponent rule: a^{b - c} = a^b / a^c. Applied here, b is m and c is 2n, so 3^{m - 2n} = 3^m / 3^{2n}. Then, 3^m is given as 4. Then, 3^{2n} is (3^n)^2, which is 5^2 = 25. So 4 divided by 25. That gives 4/25. Hmm, 4 divided by 25 is 0.16 in decimal, but the problem probably expects a fraction. So 4/25 is the answer. Let me just make sure there's no alternative way to approach this.Alternatively, maybe I can express m and n in terms of logarithms? Let's see. If 3^m = 4, then m = log base 3 of 4. Similarly, n = log base 3 of 5. Then, m - 2n would be log3(4) - 2*log3(5). Then, using logarithm rules, 2*log3(5) is log3(5^2) = log3(25). So, log3(4) - log3(25) is log3(4/25). Therefore, 3^{m - 2n} = 3^{log3(4/25)}. Since 3 raised to the log base 3 of something is just that something, so that simplifies to 4/25. So that confirms the same answer.Okay, so both methods lead me to 4/25. So I think that's correct. Let me check if the problem is expecting maybe a different form, like mixed number or decimal? But since 4/25 is already a simple fraction, and there's no indication otherwise, I think that's the answer. Wait, another way: Maybe express 3^{m - 2n} as 3^m * 3^{-2n} which is 3^m * (3^n)^{-2}. Then substituting the given values: 4 * (5)^{-2} = 4 * (1/25) = 4/25. Yep, same result. So regardless of the approach, it's 4/25. Alright, so I think that's the answer. Seems straightforward once I break it down using exponent rules. Maybe I was overcomplicating it at first, but verifying through different methods gives me confidence.Final AnswerThe value of (3^{m-2n}) is boxed{dfrac{4}{25}}.</think>Given the problem: If (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5), we need to find the value of (3^{m-2n}).First, we use the exponent rule (a^{b - c} = frac{a^b}{a^c}). Applying this rule, we can rewrite (3^{m - 2n}) as:[3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{3^{2n}}]We know from the problem statement that (3^m = 4). Next, we need to find (3^{2n}). Using the exponent rule ((a^b)^c = a^{bc}), we can express (3^{2n}) as:[3^{2n} = (3^n)^2]Given (3^n = 5), substituting this value gives:[(3^n)^2 = 5^2 = 25]Now substituting (3^m = 4) and (3^{2n} = 25) into the expression for (3^{m - 2n}), we get:[3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{3^{2n}} = frac{4}{25}]Thus, the value of (3^{m-2n}) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{25}}).,<think>Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of (3^{m - 2n}) given that (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5). Hmm, exponents. Alright, let me start by recalling some exponent rules. First, I know that when you subtract exponents with the same base, you can express that as division. Specifically, (3^{m - 2n}) should be the same as (3^m) divided by (3^{2n}). So, (3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{3^{2n}}). Wait, but (3^{2n}) can be written as ((3^n)^2), right? Because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, (3^{2n} = (3^n)^2). That seems correct. Let me check that: ( (3^n)^2 = 3^n times 3^n = 3^{n + n} = 3^{2n}). Yep, that works out.So substituting the known values here. They gave me (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5). So replacing those in the expression, I should have:(3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{(3^n)^2} = frac{4}{(5)^2} = frac{4}{25}). Wait, so is that all? Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. Let me go through it again.Starting with (3^{m - 2n}), which is a single exponent with base 3. The exponent here is (m - 2n). According to the laws of exponents, specifically the property (a^{b - c} = frac{a^b}{a^c}), this can be rewritten as (frac{3^m}{3^{2n}}). Then, (3^{2n}) can be written as ((3^n)^2), which is 5 squared since (3^n = 5). So (5^2 = 25). Therefore, substituting back, we have (frac{4}{25}). Seems straightforward, but let me verify using logarithms to check if there's another way. If I take the logarithm base 3 of both sides of the original equations, then for (3^m = 4), we get (m = log_3 4), and for (3^n = 5), (n = log_3 5). Then (m - 2n = log_3 4 - 2 log_3 5). Using logarithm properties, this is (log_3 4 - log_3 5^2 = log_3 left(frac{4}{25}right)). Therefore, (3^{m - 2n} = 3^{log_3 (4/25)} = frac{4}{25}). Okay, so that's the same answer. So both methods confirm that the value is (frac{4}{25}). I think that's solid. Let me check once more. If (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5), then substituting directly into (3^{m - 2n}) gives (4 / 5^2 = 4/25). Yep, that's right. No mistakes here. So I feel confident that the answer is 4/25.Final AnswerThe value of (3^{m - 2n}) is boxed{dfrac{4}{25}}.</think>Given (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5), we need to find the value of (3^{m - 2n}).First, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite (3^{m - 2n}):[3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{3^{2n}}]Next, we recognize that (3^{2n}) can be written as ((3^n)^2):[3^{2n} = (3^n)^2]Substituting the given values (3^m = 4) and (3^n = 5) into the expression, we get:[3^{m - 2n} = frac{3^m}{(3^n)^2} = frac{4}{5^2} = frac{4}{25}]Thus, the value of (3^{m - 2n}) is (boxed{dfrac{4}{25}}).]"},{"problem":"Let E be the set of all bijective mappings from mathbb R to mathbb R satisfying[f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t, qquad forall t in mathbb R,]where f^{-1} is the mapping inverse to f.

Given Condition and Initial Analysis:   We are given that ( f ) is a bijective mapping from (mathbb{R}) to (mathbb{R}) satisfying:   [   f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t, quad forall t in mathbb{R},   ]   where ( f^{-1} ) is the inverse of ( f ). We need to find all elements of ( E ) that are monotonic mappings.2. Monotonicity and Inverse Function:   Since ( f ) is bijective and monotonic, ( f ) must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Similarly, ( f^{-1} ) must also be strictly monotonic in the same direction as ( f ) because the inverse of a strictly increasing function is strictly increasing, and the inverse of a strictly decreasing function is strictly decreasing.3. Sum of Functions:   Given the condition ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t ), we can analyze the behavior of ( f ) and ( f^{-1} ).

I need to find all bijective and monotonic functions f from the real numbers to the real numbers such that for every real number t, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) equals 2t. Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, since f is bijective, it has an inverse function f⁻¹. The equation given is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all t. And we need to find all such f that are monotonic. So, monotonic could mean either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. But since f is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing anyway, right? Because a bijection on ℝ has to be strictly monotonic. So maybe that part is redundant? Or maybe the problem wants to ensure we consider both possibilities? Not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.Let me start by trying to express f⁻¹ in terms of f. If f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t, then rearranging gives f⁻¹(t) = 2t - f(t). Wait, but f⁻¹(t) is the inverse function, so that means if I let y = f(t), then t = f⁻¹(y). So substituting into the equation, we get y + f⁻¹(y) = 2t. But since t = f⁻¹(y), this becomes y + f⁻¹(y) = 2f⁻¹(y). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me write that again.Suppose y = f(t). Then t = f⁻¹(y). The original equation is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Let's substitute t with f⁻¹(y). Then the equation becomes f(f⁻¹(y)) + f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = 2f⁻¹(y). Simplifying f(f⁻¹(y)) gives y. So, y + f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = 2f⁻¹(y). Therefore, f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = 2f⁻¹(y) - y.Hmm, that's an equation involving the inverse function composed with itself. Let me denote g(y) = f⁻¹(y). Then the equation becomes g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. So, we have a functional equation: g(g(y)) + y = 2g(y). So, this is the same as g²(y) - 2g(y) + y = 0, where g² is the composition of g with itself. Interesting.So, if I can solve this functional equation for g, then f would be the inverse of g. Since f and g are inverses, and f is monotonic, so is g. So, maybe solving this functional equation for g will help me find f.So, let's think about how to solve g(g(y)) + y = 2g(y). Let me rearrange it as g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. This looks similar to a linear difference equation or something. Maybe we can look for linear functions g(y) that satisfy this. Let me try assuming that g is linear, say g(y) = a y + b. Then let's see what the equation becomes.If g(y) = a y + b, then g(g(y)) = a(a y + b) + b = a² y + a b + b. Then, according to the equation, we have:a² y + a b + b = 2(a y + b) - ySimplify the right-hand side: 2a y + 2b - y = (2a - 1) y + 2bTherefore, equate coefficients:For the y term: a² = 2a - 1For the constant term: a b + b = 2b => a b = bSo, solving these equations:First equation: a² - 2a + 1 = 0 => (a - 1)^2 = 0 => a = 1Second equation: If a = 1, then 1 * b = b => 0 = 0, which is always true. So b can be any real number? Wait, but then if a = 1 and b is arbitrary, then g(y) = y + b. Let's check if this satisfies the original functional equation.If g(y) = y + b, then g(g(y)) = g(y + b) = y + b + b = y + 2b. Then according to the equation, this should equal 2g(y) - y = 2(y + b) - y = 2y + 2b - y = y + 2b. So yes, it works. So g(y) = y + b is a solution for any real number b.But wait, but we need g to be invertible because g is f⁻¹, which is the inverse of a bijection. So, if g(y) = y + b, then it's invertible (its inverse is y - b). So, f would be the inverse of g, which is f(t) = t - b.Let me check if f(t) = t - b satisfies the original equation. Let's compute f(t) + f⁻¹(t). f(t) = t - b, so f⁻¹(t) is t + b. Therefore, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t - b) + (t + b) = 2t. Perfect, that works. So for any real number b, f(t) = t - b is a solution.But wait, the problem says \\"Find all elements of E that are monotonic mappings.\\" So, these linear functions are certainly monotonic (they are increasing if the slope is positive, which in this case the slope is 1, so they are increasing). So, these are all linear solutions. But are there any other solutions?Wait, but in the functional equation for g, we assumed g is linear, but maybe there are non-linear solutions? The problem asks for all monotonic bijections, so we need to check if only linear functions satisfy this or if there are non-linear ones.Let me see. Suppose g is a non-linear function satisfying g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. Let's see if such a function can exist. Maybe not. Let's test some simple non-linear functions.For example, suppose g(y) is quadratic: g(y) = a y² + b y + c. Then g(g(y)) would be a(a y² + b y + c)² + b(a y² + b y + c) + c. That's going to be a quartic function. On the other hand, 2g(y) - y = 2a y² + 2b y + 2c - y. So, a quartic equals a quadratic? Only possible if all higher degree coefficients are zero. So unless a = 0, which would make g linear. So quadratic functions won't work. Similarly, cubic functions would lead to higher degrees. So, perhaps only linear functions satisfy this equation?Alternatively, maybe piecewise functions? Let's consider a piecewise linear function. Suppose g(y) is piecewise linear with different slopes in different intervals. But then composing g with itself would probably not result in a function that's 2g(y) - y everywhere. It might get complicated. Let me try a simple case.Suppose g(y) is defined as y + 1 for y ≤ 0 and y - 1 for y > 0. Then let's compute g(g(y)). For y ≤ 0: g(y) = y + 1. If y ≤ 0, then y + 1 ≤ 1. So if y + 1 ≤ 0, i.e., y ≤ -1, then g(g(y)) = g(y + 1) = (y + 1) + 1 = y + 2. If y > -1 but y ≤ 0, then y + 1 is between 0 and 1, so g(g(y)) = g(y + 1) = (y + 1) - 1 = y. For y > 0: g(y) = y - 1. Then y - 1 could be ≤ 0 or > 0. If y > 1, then y - 1 > 0, so g(g(y)) = g(y - 1) = (y - 1) - 1 = y - 2. If 0 < y ≤ 1, then y - 1 ≤ 0, so g(g(y)) = g(y - 1) = (y - 1) + 1 = y. So putting it all together:g(g(y)) =- y + 2, if y ≤ -1- y, if -1 < y ≤ 1- y - 2, if y > 1But according to the equation g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. Let's compute 2g(y) - y:For y ≤ 0: 2(y + 1) - y = 2y + 2 - y = y + 2For y > 0: 2(y - 1) - y = 2y - 2 - y = y - 2So, comparing:- For y ≤ -1: g(g(y)) = y + 2, and 2g(y) - y = y + 2. So matches.- For -1 < y ≤ 0: g(g(y)) = y, but 2g(y) - y = y + 2. Wait, this doesn't match. Here, when -1 < y ≤ 0, g(g(y)) = y, but 2g(y) - y = y + 2. So unless y = y + 2, which is not possible, this doesn't hold. Similarly, for 0 < y ≤ 1: g(g(y)) = y, but 2g(y) - y = y - 2. Again, y ≠ y - 2 unless y is infinity. So, this piecewise function only satisfies the equation for y ≤ -1 and y > 1, but not in the middle intervals. Therefore, this piecewise function is not a solution.So, maybe trying to make a non-linear or piecewise linear function doesn't work. Therefore, perhaps the only solutions are linear functions. Let's verify this.Suppose that g is a differentiable function (since it's monotonic, it's differentiable almost everywhere, but maybe assuming smoothness for simplicity). Let me try differentiating the equation g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. Taking derivative of both sides:Using the chain rule, the left-hand side derivative is g’(g(y)) * g’(y). The right-hand side derivative is 2g’(y) - 1. So:g’(g(y)) * g’(y) = 2g’(y) - 1If we suppose that g is linear, then g’(y) is constant. Let’s check. Let’s let g(y) = a y + b, so g’(y) = a. Then the left-hand side becomes a * a = a². The right-hand side is 2a - 1. So a² = 2a - 1, which is the same equation as before, leading to a = 1. Then, with a = 1, the equation is 1 = 2*1 - 1 = 1, which holds. So that works. But if g is non-linear, then g’(y) is not constant. Suppose that g is non-linear, can the equation still hold?Let me suppose that g is a strictly increasing function (since f is bijective and monotonic, so g = f⁻¹ is also strictly monotonic; if f is increasing, then g is increasing; if f is decreasing, then g is decreasing). Wait, the problem says \\"monotonic mappings\\", so f could be increasing or decreasing. But if f is decreasing, then so is g = f⁻¹. Hmm. Let me consider both cases.First, suppose that g is strictly increasing. Then, since it's differentiable (assuming smoothness), the derivative is positive. Let’s write the equation again:g’(g(y)) * g’(y) = 2g’(y) - 1Let’s divide both sides by g’(y) (since it's positive, we can do that):g’(g(y)) = 2 - 1/g’(y)Hmm, this is a functional equation for g’(y). Let’s denote h(y) = g’(y). Then the equation becomes:h(g(y)) = 2 - 1/h(y)But since g is strictly increasing and h(y) is its derivative, h(y) > 0 for all y. So, we have:h(g(y)) = 2 - 1/h(y)This seems complicated. Let me see if there's a constant solution. Suppose h(y) = k, constant. Then:k = 2 - 1/k => k² - 2k + 1 = 0 => (k - 1)^2 = 0 => k = 1. So h(y) = 1, which gives g’(y) = 1, so g(y) = y + b. Which brings us back to the linear solution. So the only constant solution is the linear one. But maybe there are non-constant solutions?Suppose we let h(y) = 1 for all y. Then g(y) = y + b, which works. What if h(y) is not constant? Let's try to find a function h(y) such that h(g(y)) = 2 - 1/h(y). Let me think recursively. Suppose we have some function h(y), and g(y) is its integral. But this seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe look for a function h satisfying this relation.Alternatively, assume that h(y) is linear. Suppose h(y) = m y + c. Then, we have:h(g(y)) = m g(y) + c = 2 - 1/(m y + c)But g(y) is the integral of h(y), so g(y) = ∫ h(y) dy + d = (m/2)y² + c y + d. Then:h(g(y)) = m*( (m/2)y² + c y + d ) + c = (m²/2)y² + m c y + m d + cBut according to the equation, this should equal 2 - 1/(m y + c). So:(m²/2)y² + m c y + m d + c = 2 - 1/(m y + c)This is a quadratic function on the left and a function with a reciprocal term on the right. These can only be equal if all coefficients of the quadratic terms are zero and the reciprocal term somehow cancels out. But the reciprocal term 1/(m y + c) can't be expressed as a quadratic function. Therefore, this suggests that h(y) cannot be linear. Therefore, perhaps there are no non-linear solutions if we assume h(y) is linear? But this is getting too convoluted.Alternatively, let's consider the case where f is a decreasing function. If f is decreasing, then its inverse f⁻¹ is also decreasing. Because the inverse of a decreasing function is decreasing. So, if f is decreasing, then g = f⁻¹ is also decreasing. Let's see if such functions can satisfy the original equation.Suppose f is decreasing. Then, since both f and f⁻¹ are decreasing, the left-hand side f(t) + f⁻¹(t) would be the sum of two decreasing functions, which might be a bit tricky. But the right-hand side 2t is increasing. So, the sum of two decreasing functions equals an increasing function. That seems possible, but maybe restrictive.But let's try to see if there are any decreasing solutions. Suppose f is decreasing and linear. Let’s assume f(t) = -a t + b, where a > 0. Then f⁻¹(t) can be computed. To find the inverse, set y = -a t + b, solve for t: t = (b - y)/a. So f⁻¹(t) = (b - t)/a. Then, according to the equation f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t:(-a t + b) + (b - t)/a = 2tLet’s simplify:Multiply through by a to eliminate the denominator:-a² t + a b + b - t = 2a tCombine like terms:(-a² - 1 - 2a) t + (a b + b) = 0For this to hold for all t, the coefficients must be zero:Coefficient of t: -a² - 1 - 2a = 0 => a² + 2a + 1 = 0 => (a + 1)^2 = 0 => a = -1But a was supposed to be positive (since f is decreasing, slope is negative). So a = -1 gives a = -1. Wait, but a = -1 would mean the slope is -(-1) = 1? Wait, hold on. If f(t) = -a t + b, then the slope is -a. If a = -1, then the slope is -(-1) = 1, which is positive. But we wanted a decreasing function, so slope must be negative. Therefore, a must be positive. So this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there are no linear decreasing functions satisfying the equation. So perhaps all solutions are increasing linear functions?But let's confirm. If a = -1, then f(t) = -(-1)t + b = t + b. But that's an increasing function, which we already considered earlier. So in the decreasing case, we end up with a = -1, which gives an increasing function. Therefore, there are no decreasing linear solutions. So perhaps all solutions are increasing linear functions, i.e., f(t) = t + b. Wait, but earlier we had f(t) = t - b. Wait, let me check again.Wait, when we set g(y) = y + b, then f(t) is the inverse of g, so f(t) = t - b. So, the function f(t) = t + c (where c is a constant) would have an inverse f⁻¹(t) = t - c. Then f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t + c) + (t - c) = 2t. So yes, any function of the form f(t) = t + c satisfies the equation. But also, if I set f(t) = t - c, then f⁻¹(t) = t + c, and again f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t - c) + (t + c) = 2t. So, whether we write f(t) = t + c or f(t) = t - c, it's the same set of functions, just with c being any real constant. So the general linear solution is f(t) = t + c where c is a real constant.But wait, in the earlier calculation when we assumed g(y) is linear, we found that a = 1 and b is arbitrary, leading to f(t) = t - b. So yes, c can be any real number, positive or negative. Therefore, the set of linear solutions is all functions of the form f(t) = t + c for some constant c ∈ ℝ.But the problem says \\"Find all elements of E that are monotonic mappings.\\" Since we've considered linear functions, which are monotonic (specifically, strictly increasing because the slope is 1), and we saw that decreasing functions can't be linear solutions. But could there be non-linear monotonic solutions?Suppose there exists a non-linear monotonic function f satisfying the equation. Let's assume f is differentiable for simplicity. Then, as we saw earlier, the derivative condition is:g’(g(y)) * g’(y) = 2g’(y) - 1, where g = f⁻¹But if f is non-linear, then g is also non-linear, and their derivatives are not constant. Let me see if there's a way to construct such a function or prove that no non-linear function can satisfy this.Suppose we try an exponential function. Let’s say g(y) = e^{k y} + c. But this is probably not going to work. Alternatively, maybe something else.Alternatively, let's consider the functional equation g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y. Let me try to iterate this equation. Suppose we apply g three times:g(g(g(y))) = g(2g(y) - y). But also, from the original equation, replacing y with g(y), we have g(g(g(y))) = 2g(g(y)) - g(y) = 2(2g(y) - y) - g(y) = 4g(y) - 2y - g(y) = 3g(y) - 2y.On the other hand, g(2g(y) - y) should equal 3g(y) - 2y. So:g(2g(y) - y) = 3g(y) - 2yThis is another functional equation. Maybe this can help us. Let me see if this can lead us somewhere.If we let z = 2g(y) - y, then the equation becomes g(z) = 3g(y) - 2y. But z = 2g(y) - y, so perhaps expressing y in terms of z? Maybe not straightforward.Alternatively, let's assume that g is linear, which we already know works. If g(y) = y + b, then let's check the equation g(2g(y) - y) = 3g(y) - 2y.Left-hand side: g(2(y + b) - y) = g(y + 2b) = (y + 2b) + b = y + 3bRight-hand side: 3(y + b) - 2y = 3y + 3b - 2y = y + 3bSo equality holds. So linear functions satisfy this. What if we suppose a different function?Alternatively, suppose g is affine linear, which we already considered. So perhaps the only solutions are affine linear functions. But how to prove that?Alternatively, consider writing the functional equation as g(g(y)) - 2g(y) + y = 0. If we think of this as a second-order linear recurrence, but in functions. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, treat y as a variable and consider the equation g(g(y)) + y = 2g(y). Let’s rearrange it as g(g(y)) - 2g(y) + y = 0. If we consider the left-hand side as a sort of \\"operator\\" applied to g, maybe we can factor it.Suppose we think of this as (g ∘ g - 2g + id)(y) = 0, where id is the identity function. Maybe factor this operator. If we think in terms of linear operators, which might be a stretch, but suppose that (g ∘ g - 2g + id) = 0. If we can factor this as (g - id)^2 = 0, then that would imply g(y) = id(y) + c, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, if we let h(y) = g(y) - y, then substituting into the equation:g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - yExpressing g(y) as h(y) + y:g(h(y) + y) = 2(h(y) + y) - y => h(h(y) + y) + (h(y) + y) = 2h(y) + 2y - y => h(h(y) + y) + h(y) + y = 2h(y) + ySimplify:h(h(y) + y) = 2h(y) + y - h(y) - y = h(y)So h(h(y) + y) = h(y)This is another functional equation. Let me see if this helps. Let me denote k(y) = h(y) + y. Then the equation becomes h(k(y)) = h(y). So h(k(y)) = h(y). If h is injective, then k(y) = y. But h(y) = g(y) - y. If g is injective, which it is because it's bijective, then h(y) = g(y) - y is also injective? Not necessarily. For example, if g(y) = y + b, then h(y) = b, which is constant, hence not injective. So in the linear case, h(y) is constant, so h(k(y)) = h(y) trivially holds because h is constant.But in the non-linear case, if h is injective, then k(y) = y. But k(y) = h(y) + y = g(y). So if h is injective, then h(g(y)) = h(y) implies g(y) = y. But g(y) = y implies h(y) = 0, which is the trivial solution. So if h is injective, only the trivial solution exists, which is h(y) = 0, leading to g(y) = y. But we already have solutions where h(y) = b, a constant. So this approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, maybe considering fixed points. A fixed point of g is a y such that g(y) = y. Suppose y is a fixed point. Then, from the equation g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y, substituting g(y) = y, we get y = 2y - y => y = y. So every fixed point satisfies the equation, but gives no new information. So fixed points can be any real numbers. However, if g(y) = y + b, then fixed points would satisfy y + b = y => b = 0. So if b ≠ 0, there are no fixed points. If b = 0, then every y is a fixed point. So that's consistent.Alternatively, suppose that g has no fixed points. For example, if g(y) = y + b with b ≠ 0, then there are no fixed points. If g(y) = y, then all points are fixed. But how does this help?Alternatively, consider the function k(y) = g(y) - y. Then, as before, k(y) + y = g(y). Then, from the equation g(g(y)) = 2g(y) - y, substitute g(y) = k(y) + y:g(k(y) + y) = 2(k(y) + y) - y => k(k(y) + y) + (k(y) + y) = 2k(y) + 2y - y => k(k(y) + y) + k(y) + y = 2k(y) + ySimplify:k(k(y) + y) = 2k(y) + y - k(y) - y = k(y)Thus, k(k(y) + y) = k(y)So, k is a function such that applying it to (k(y) + y) gives k(y). If k is a constant function, say k(y) = c, then:k(k(y) + y) = c = k(y) = cWhich holds. So constant functions k(y) = c satisfy this. This corresponds to g(y) = y + c, which are the linear solutions we found earlier.If k is not constant, is there a non-constant k that satisfies k(k(y) + y) = k(y)? For example, suppose k(y) = 0 for some y and non-zero otherwise. But since g is bijective, k(y) = g(y) - y must be such that g(y) is bijective. If k(y) is zero except at some points, g(y) would be y except at those points, which might not be bijective. For example, if k(y) is zero except at y = 0 where k(0) = 1, then g(0) = 1, but g(1) = 1 + k(1) = 1 + 0 = 1. So g(0) = g(1) = 1, which means g is not injective. Therefore, k(y) must be such that g(y) = y + k(y) is bijective. This seems to restrict k(y) to being a constant function. Because if k(y) is not constant, then the slope of g(y) would be 1 + k’(y). To be bijective, the derivative must not change sign. If k’(y) is always zero, then k is constant. If k’(y) is non-zero somewhere, then the slope would vary, but still needs to maintain monotonicity. However, if k(y) is non-constant and smooth, then the derivative 1 + k’(y) must be always positive or always negative. Suppose 1 + k’(y) > 0 for all y. Then g(y) is strictly increasing. But even so, unless k(y) is linear, the function k(k(y) + y) = k(y) would be difficult to satisfy.Alternatively, suppose k(y) is linear, k(y) = m y + c. Then:k(k(y) + y) = m(k(y) + y) + c = m(m y + c + y) + c = m((m + 1)y + c) + c = m(m + 1)y + m c + cThis should equal k(y) = m y + c. So:m(m + 1)y + m c + c = m y + cEquate coefficients:For y term: m(m + 1) = m => m² + m = m => m² = 0 => m = 0For constant term: m c + c = c => (m + 1)c = c => (0 + 1)c = c => c = c, which holds.Therefore, the only linear solution for k(y) is m = 0, which gives k(y) = c, a constant. Hence, this again leads us back to the linear solution g(y) = y + c. Therefore, non-linear k(y) don't work even if they are linear in y. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If k(y) is linear, we end up with m = 0, hence constant k(y). Therefore, the only solutions for k(y) are constants. Hence, the only solutions for g(y) are linear functions of the form y + c. Therefore, the only solutions for f are inverses of these, which are f(t) = t - c.Hence, combining all this, the only monotonic bijections satisfying f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all t are the linear functions f(t) = t + c where c is a real constant. Wait, but earlier we had f(t) = t - c as the inverse of g(y) = y + c. So f(t) = g⁻¹(t) = t - c. So yes, both forms are equivalent, with c being any real constant.Therefore, the set E consists of all functions f(t) = t + c for some constant c ∈ ℝ. These are all strictly increasing functions, as their derivative is 1, which is positive. There are no decreasing functions in E because, as we saw earlier, assuming a decreasing function leads to a contradiction unless it's actually increasing.So, after all this, the conclusion is that the only monotonic bijections in E are the linear functions f(t) = t + c for some constant c. Therefore, the answer should be all functions of the form f(t) = t + c where c is a real number.Final AnswerThe monotonic mappings in ( E ) are all linear functions of the form (boxed{f(t) = t + c}) where ( c ) is a real constant.</think>Given the problem of finding all bijective and monotonic mappings ( f ) from (mathbb{R}) to (mathbb{R}) that satisfy the equation ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t ) for all ( t in mathbb{R} ), we start by analyzing the functional equation and its implications.1. Functional Equation Analysis:   - The given equation ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t ) can be rearranged to express the inverse function ( f^{-1} ) in terms of ( f ). Let ( g = f^{-1} ), then the equation becomes ( g(g(t)) = 2g(t) - t ).2. Linear Function Assumption:   - Assuming ( g ) is a linear function, we let ( g(t) = at + b ). Substituting this into the functional equation, we find that ( a = 1 ) and ( b ) is an arbitrary constant. This gives ( g(t) = t + b ).3. Inverse Function Calculation:   - The inverse of ( g(t) = t + b ) is ( f(t) = t - b ). Verifying this in the original equation, we get ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = (t - b) + (t + b) = 2t ), which satisfies the given condition.4. Monotonicity and Bijectivity:   - Since ( f(t) = t + c ) (where ( c ) is a real constant) is a linear function with a slope of 1, it is strictly increasing and hence bijective. Any constant ( c ) will maintain the bijectivity and monotonicity of ( f ).5. Non-linear Solutions:   - Considering the possibility of non-linear solutions, we analyze the functional equation and its derivatives. However, non-linear functions lead to contradictions or do not satisfy the necessary conditions for bijectivity and monotonicity.6. Conclusion:   - The only solutions that satisfy the given functional equation, bijectivity, and monotonicity are linear functions of the form ( f(t) = t + c ) where ( c ) is a real constant.Thus, the monotonic mappings in ( E ) are all linear functions of the form (boxed{f(t) = t + c}) where ( c ) is a real constant.,<think>Okay, let's see. I need to find all bijective and monotonic functions f from ℝ to ℝ such that f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all real t. Hmm, interesting problem. Let me start by understanding what this condition implies.First, since f is bijective, it has an inverse function f⁻¹. The equation given is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Wait, but here the argument is t, not f(t) or something else. So for every real number t, the sum of f(t) and its inverse function evaluated at t is twice t. That seems like a functional equation. Let's try to manipulate it.Maybe I can express f⁻¹(t) in terms of f. Let me denote y = f(t). Then, by definition of inverse function, f⁻¹(y) = t. But the equation given is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. So substituting y = f(t), we get y + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. But since f⁻¹(y) = t, maybe we can write f⁻¹(t) in terms of y?Wait, maybe I should express f⁻¹(t) in terms of f. Let me think. If I let t be any real number, then f⁻¹(t) is the value s such that f(s) = t. So s = f⁻¹(t). Then, substituting into the equation, we have f(s) + f⁻¹(f(s)) = 2s. But f⁻¹(f(s)) is s, right? Because applying f and then f inverse gets you back to s. So this becomes t + s = 2s, which simplifies to t = s. But s = f⁻¹(t), so t = f⁻¹(t). Wait, that would mean f⁻¹(t) = t for all t, which would imply f(t) = t. But that's only one function. However, the problem says \\"find all elements of E that are monotonic mappings.\\" So maybe f(t) = t is the only solution? But that seems too straightforward. Let me check my reasoning again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me go back step by step. The original equation is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all t. If I take t as a variable, then for each t, f(t) is some value, and f⁻¹(t) is the s such that f(s) = t. So let's denote s = f⁻¹(t). Then, by definition, f(s) = t. So substituting into the original equation, we have f(t) + s = 2t. But s = f⁻¹(t). So f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. But also, since s = f⁻¹(t), then t = f(s). Therefore, we can write:f(t) + s = 2t,t = f(s).So substituting s = f⁻¹(t) into the first equation, we get:f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.But that's just the original equation. Maybe I need to combine these equations in some way. Let's try to express s in terms of t. Since s = f⁻¹(t), then t = f(s). Let's replace t with f(s) in the first equation. Then we have:f(f(s)) + s = 2f(s).So f(f(s)) + s = 2f(s).Rewriting, f(f(s)) = 2f(s) - s.Hmm, this gives a functional equation for f composed with f. Maybe we can write this as f(f(s)) = 2f(s) - s. Let me denote this as equation (1).Alternatively, if I let u = f(s), then s = f⁻¹(u), so the equation becomes f(u) = 2u - f⁻¹(u). But from the original equation, f⁻¹(u) = 2u - f(u). Wait, substituting that into the previous equation, we get f(u) = 2u - (2u - f(u)) = 2u - 2u + f(u) = f(u). Hmm, that just gives an identity, so no new information.Maybe we can iterate equation (1). Since f(f(s)) = 2f(s) - s, then applying f again, we get f(f(f(s))) = 2f(f(s)) - f(s). Substituting the previous expression for f(f(s)), this becomes f(f(f(s))) = 2(2f(s) - s) - f(s) = 4f(s) - 2s - f(s) = 3f(s) - 2s.But perhaps this isn't helpful yet. Let me see if I can find a form for f. Since f is bijective and monotonic, it's either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. But let's first assume it's linear. Suppose f(t) = at + b. Then, f⁻¹(t) would be (t - b)/a, provided that a ≠ 0. Let's check if such a function satisfies the equation.So, substituting into f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t:at + b + (t - b)/a = 2t.Simplify the left-hand side:at + b + t/a - b/a = (a + 1/a)t + b - b/a.Set this equal to 2t. So, coefficients must match:(a + 1/a) = 2,and the constant term:b - b/a = 0.First, solve for a:a + 1/a = 2 => a² - 2a + 1 = 0 => (a - 1)^2 = 0 => a = 1.Then, substituting a = 1 into the constant equation:b - b/1 = 0 => 0 = 0, which is always true. So for a linear function, the only solution is f(t) = t + b, but since a=1, it's f(t) = t + b, but wait, the inverse of f(t) = t + b is f⁻¹(t) = t - b. Then, check the original equation:f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t, which works. So all linear functions of the form f(t) = t + b satisfy the equation. Wait, but hold on, but if b ≠ 0, then f(t) = t + b is a bijection and monotonic. But according to the problem, we need to find all elements of E that are monotonic. So does this mean there are multiple solutions? Wait, but earlier when I tried substituting, I thought f(t) = t is the only solution, but now with linear functions, f(t) = t + b also works? But wait, let's check with b ≠ 0.Take f(t) = t + b. Then f⁻¹(t) = t - b. Then f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t. So yes, it works. But the problem states \\"bijective mappings from ℝ to ℝ\\", so these are bijective. Also, they are monotonic since they are linear with slope 1, which is positive. So these are all strictly increasing functions. But wait, earlier when I tried substituting, I thought f⁻¹(t) = t implies f(t) = t, but here f(t) = t + b also works. So that suggests that my initial reasoning was flawed.Wait, but why did I think f⁻¹(t) = t? Because when I substituted t = f(s), I had f(t) + s = 2t, but s = f⁻¹(t). But then, if f(t) = t + b, then s = f⁻¹(t) = t - b. Then f(t) + s = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, these linear functions are solutions. So there are infinitely many solutions of the form f(t) = t + b. But wait, but in the problem statement, the condition is f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all t. So if f(t) = t + b, then f⁻¹(t) = t - b, and indeed f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. So those are valid solutions.But then, why did my initial substitution lead me to think f⁻¹(t) = t? Maybe I made a mistake there.Let me revisit that. Suppose I take the original equation f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Let me denote s = f⁻¹(t). Then, since f(s) = t, we can write f(t) + s = 2t. But s = f⁻¹(t) = t - b if f(t) = t + b. Then, substituting into f(t) + s = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t. So that works. So perhaps my initial mistake was thinking that substituting t = f(s) leads to a contradiction, but actually, when f is linear, it's consistent.Therefore, maybe there are infinitely many linear solutions. But wait, when I set up the equation for a linear function f(t) = at + b, we found that a must be 1, and b can be any real number. So indeed, all functions f(t) = t + b are solutions. But wait, but if f is linear and invertible, then it must have a non-zero slope. Here, slope is 1, so invertible. Therefore, linear solutions are f(t) = t + b for any real b.But the problem says \\"Find all elements of E that are monotonic mappings.\\" So, if all linear functions of the form f(t) = t + b are solutions, and they are monotonic (since slope 1 is positive), then these would all be valid. But perhaps there are non-linear solutions as well? The problem doesn't restrict to linear functions, so maybe there are non-linear monotonic bijections that satisfy the equation.Wait, let's test a non-linear function. Suppose f(t) is some non-linear function. Let's assume f is strictly increasing, differentiable maybe. Let me try f(t) = t. Then f⁻¹(t) = t, so f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t, which works. If I take f(t) = t + b, as before, works. What if I try f(t) = -t + c? Wait, but then f is decreasing, but bijective. Let's check if it satisfies the equation. Suppose f(t) = -t + c. Then f⁻¹(t) = c - t. Then f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (-t + c) + (c - t) = 2c - 2t. For this to equal 2t for all t, we need 2c - 2t = 2t => 2c = 4t => c = 2t, which is not possible unless c is variable, but c is a constant. So no solution here. Therefore, decreasing functions don't work. So maybe only increasing functions can satisfy the equation.But the problem allows for monotonic mappings, which can be increasing or decreasing. But our test shows that decreasing linear functions don't work. So perhaps only increasing functions are possible.So maybe all solutions are linear functions of the form f(t) = t + b. But let's check another non-linear function. Suppose f(t) = t + sin(t). Wait, is this bijective? The derivative is 1 + cos(t), which is non-negative since cos(t) ≥ -1, so 1 + cos(t) ≥ 0. But 1 + cos(t) = 0 when cos(t) = -1, i.e., at t = π + 2πk. So the derivative is zero at those points, which means the function is not strictly increasing, hence not invertible. So f(t) = t + sin(t) is not bijective. So maybe hard to find a non-linear bijective function.Alternatively, suppose f(t) is a piecewise function. For example, f(t) = t for t ≤ 0 and f(t) = t + 1 for t > 0. But this is not continuous, though bijective. Let's check if it satisfies f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.First, find f⁻¹(t). For t ≤ 0, f⁻¹(t) = t. For t > 0, since f(t) = t + 1, then f⁻¹(t) = t - 1. So f(t) + f⁻¹(t) would be:For t ≤ 0: f(t) = t, f⁻¹(t) = t, so sum is 2t. Good.For t > 0: f(t) = t + 1, but wait, no. Wait, f(t) is defined as t for t ≤ 0 and t + 1 for t > 0. So when t > 0, f(t) = t + 1, so the inverse function for y > 1 is f⁻¹(y) = y - 1. For y ≤ 1, since f(t) = t for t ≤ 0, but if t > 0, f(t) = t + 1 > 1. So the inverse function f⁻¹(t) is:If t ≤ 0, then f⁻¹(t) = t.If t > 1, then f⁻¹(t) = t - 1.But what about t between 0 and 1? There's no t such that f(t) = t between 0 and 1, because for t ≤ 0, f(t) = t ≤ 0, and for t > 0, f(t) = t + 1 > 1. Therefore, f is not surjective onto ℝ, since the interval (0,1] is not covered. Therefore, this function is not bijective. So that attempt fails.Alternatively, maybe a more complex piecewise function. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the only solutions are linear functions f(t) = t + b. But let's try to see if that's the case.Suppose f is a monotonic bijection satisfying f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t for all t. Let's consider that equation. For any t, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Let me denote y = f(t). Then, f⁻¹(y) = t. So substituting into the original equation, we have y + f⁻¹(y) = 2t. But t = f⁻¹(y), so substituting that in, we get y + f⁻¹(y) = 2f⁻¹(y). Therefore, y = f⁻¹(y). Wait, that would imply f⁻¹(y) = y for all y, which would mean f(y) = y. But this contradicts the earlier result that f(t) = t + b is a solution.Wait, so where is the mistake here?Let me go through this again. Start with f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Let y = f(t), so t = f⁻¹(y). Substitute into the equation:y + f⁻¹(y) = 2f⁻¹(y) => y = f⁻¹(y).Therefore, f⁻¹(y) = y => f(y) = y. But this suggests that the only solution is f(t) = t. But earlier, we saw that f(t) = t + b works. So which one is correct?Wait, if f(t) = t + b, then f⁻¹(t) = t - b. Then, according to the equation f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t. That works, but according to the substitution above, y + f⁻¹(y) = 2f⁻¹(y) => y = f⁻¹(y). But in this case, y = t + b, and f⁻¹(y) = y - b. So y - b = t. But t = f⁻¹(y). So substituting back, y - b = f⁻¹(y). Therefore, y = f⁻¹(y) + b. But this contradicts y = f⁻¹(y). Wait, unless b = 0. So here's the problem. If we do the substitution:Starting with f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.Let y = f(t), so t = f⁻¹(y). Substitute into the equation:y + f⁻¹(f(t)) = 2t. But f⁻¹(f(t)) is t, so y + t = 2t => y = t. Therefore, y = t, which would mean f(t) = t. But this contradicts the example where f(t) = t + b.Wait, this suggests that f(t) = t is the only solution. But that contradicts the earlier calculation where f(t) = t + b satisfies the equation. So something is wrong here. Let me check with f(t) = t + b.Take f(t) = t + 1. Then f⁻¹(t) = t - 1. Let's pick a specific t, say t = 0. Then f(0) = 1, and f⁻¹(0) = -1. So f(0) + f⁻¹(0) = 1 + (-1) = 0, which is equal to 2*0 = 0. That works. For t = 1, f(1) = 2, f⁻¹(1) = 0. So 2 + 0 = 2*1 = 2. That works. Wait, so why does the substitution suggest that f(t) must be t?Ah! Wait, perhaps the substitution is not considering that when you set y = f(t), then the equation becomes y + f⁻¹(y) = 2t, but t is f⁻¹(y). Therefore, substituting t = f⁻¹(y) gives y + f⁻¹(y) = 2f⁻¹(y) => y = f⁻¹(y). Which would require f⁻¹(y) = y, hence f(y) = y. But in our example, f⁻¹(y) = y - b, so substituting into y = f⁻¹(y) gives y = y - b => b = 0. So this suggests that only f(t) = t satisfies the equation. But we have an example where f(t) = t + b does satisfy the equation. So where is the mistake here?Wait, maybe the substitution is correct, but my example is wrong? Wait, let's check again. If f(t) = t + b, then f⁻¹(t) = t - b. Then for any t, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t. That's correct. But according to the substitution:Start with y = f(t), so t = f⁻¹(y). Then, original equation f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t becomes y + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. But here, t is still the original t. Wait, maybe I confused variables here. Let me clarify.Original equation: For all t in ℝ, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.Let y = f(t). Then f⁻¹(y) = t. So the equation can be rewritten for y: f(f⁻¹(y)) + f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = 2f⁻¹(y). But f(f⁻¹(y)) = y. So this gives y + f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = 2f⁻¹(y). Let me denote z = f⁻¹(y). Then, this equation becomes y + f⁻¹(z) = 2z. But since z = f⁻¹(y), and y = f(z), so substituting, we get f(z) + f⁻¹(z) = 2z. Wait, but this is just the original equation applied to z. So this substitution leads us back to the original equation, which doesn't give new information.Alternatively, maybe I need to iterate the function. Let me suppose that f is a linear function f(t) = t + b. Then, as we saw, it satisfies the equation. But according to the substitution approach, if we set y = f(t), then we get y + f⁻¹(y) = 2t. But t = f⁻¹(y) = y - b. So substituting into the equation: y + (y - b) = 2(y - b). Which simplifies to 2y - b = 2y - 2b => -b = -2b => b = 0. Therefore, only when b = 0 does this hold. But wait, this contradicts our earlier example where b ≠ 0 worked. Wait, but in reality, when f(t) = t + b, f⁻¹(t) = t - b, so for the substitution:Original equation: f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.Set y = f(t) => t = f⁻¹(y). Then, equation becomes y + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. But t = f⁻¹(y), so f⁻¹(t) = f⁻¹(f⁻¹(y)) = f⁻²(y). Therefore, the equation becomes y + f⁻²(y) = 2f⁻¹(y).But for f(t) = t + b, f⁻¹(y) = y - b, so f⁻²(y) = f⁻¹(y - b) = (y - b) - b = y - 2b.Therefore, substituting into the equation: y + (y - 2b) = 2(y - b) => 2y - 2b = 2y - 2b. Which holds for all y. So actually, the substitution does not require b = 0. Therefore, my previous mistake was in miscalculating the substitution. Therefore, the substitution does not lead to a contradiction, and f(t) = t + b is indeed a valid solution.Therefore, the problem arises when we incorrectly applied substitution. So, in fact, functions of the form f(t) = t + b do satisfy the equation, and the substitution approach when done correctly does not lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the previous conclusion that only f(t) = t works was wrong because of incorrect substitution steps.Therefore, the set E includes all functions f such that f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t, and we need to find all monotonic ones. So far, we have linear functions f(t) = t + b. Are there any others?Suppose f is non-linear, but monotonic. Let's assume f is differentiable for simplicity. Let's differentiate both sides of the equation f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t with respect to t.The derivative of f(t) is f’(t). The derivative of f⁻¹(t) is 1/f’(f⁻¹(t)) by the inverse function theorem. Therefore, differentiating both sides:f’(t) + [1/f’(f⁻¹(t))] = 2.But since f⁻¹(t) = s where f(s) = t, so s = f⁻¹(t). Then, f’(s) = f’(f⁻¹(t)). Therefore, the derivative equation becomes:f’(t) + [1/f’(s)] = 2, where s = f⁻¹(t).But s = f⁻¹(t) => t = f(s). So we can write this as:f’(t) + [1/f’(s)] = 2, with t = f(s).Let me denote t = f(s), so s = f⁻¹(t). Then, the equation becomes:f’(f(s)) + [1/f’(s)] = 2.This is a differential equation in terms of s. Let me write it as:f’(f(s)) + 1/f’(s) = 2.This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can assume f is linear. If f is linear, f(s) = s + b, then f’(s) = 1, so f’(f(s)) = 1. Then, 1 + 1/1 = 2, which satisfies the equation. So linear functions satisfy the differential equation.But maybe there are non-linear solutions. Let's suppose f is non-linear but satisfies the differential equation. Let me set g(s) = f(s) - s. Then f(s) = s + g(s), and we want g(s) to be such that f is bijective and monotonic.But this might not lead anywhere. Alternatively, let's consider the differential equation:f’(f(s)) + 1/f’(s) = 2.Let’s denote u(s) = f’(s). Then, f’(f(s)) = u(f(s)). So the equation becomes:u(f(s)) + 1/u(s) = 2.This is a functional-differential equation. It relates u(s) and u(f(s)). Let’s assume that u is a constant function. If u(s) = c for all s, then u(f(s)) = c. Then, the equation becomes c + 1/c = 2. Solving this, c^2 - 2c + 1 = 0 => (c - 1)^2 = 0 => c = 1. Therefore, constant derivative 1 implies f(s) = s + b, which is consistent with our previous result.What if u is not constant? Suppose u(s) = 1 for some s and different elsewhere, but this would contradict the equation unless u(s) is always 1. Alternatively, perhaps there's a non-constant solution.Suppose we set u(f(s)) = 2 - 1/u(s). Let me think recursively. If I know u(s), then u(f(s)) is determined. But since f(s) = integral of u(s) ds + constant, it's a bit intertwined.Alternatively, let me suppose that u(s) satisfies u(f(s)) = 2 - 1/u(s). If I iterate this, then u(f(f(s))) = 2 - 1/u(f(s)) = 2 - 1/(2 - 1/u(s)).But this seems complicated. Let me check if a linear function is the only solution. Suppose f is non-linear but satisfies the equation. For example, suppose f(s) = ks + b. Wait, we already saw that k must be 1. So even affine functions must have slope 1. So maybe only translations are allowed. Therefore, perhaps the only solutions are f(t) = t + b.Alternatively, consider another example. Suppose f(t) = t for t ≤ 0 and f(t) = t + 1 for t > 0. As before, this is piecewise linear with slope 1 everywhere except at t = 0, where there's a jump. However, as discussed earlier, this function is not bijective over ℝ because it's not surjective (misses the interval (0,1]). Therefore, such a function is invalid.Alternatively, maybe a function with varying slopes but still maintaining the condition f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t. Suppose f(t) = t + b(t), where b(t) is some function. Then, f⁻¹(t) = t - b(f⁻¹(t)). Substituting into the original equation:f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = t + b(t) + t - b(f⁻¹(t)) = 2t + b(t) - b(f⁻¹(t)) = 2t.Therefore, we must have b(t) = b(f⁻¹(t)) for all t. Let’s denote s = f⁻¹(t). Then, t = f(s) = s + b(s). So the equation becomes b(t) = b(s). But s = f⁻¹(t) = t - b(t). Therefore, b(t) = b(t - b(t)).This is a functional equation for b. Let’s suppose b is a constant function, then b(t) = b(t - b(t)) implies b = b, which is always true. Hence, constant functions b(t) = b are solutions, leading to f(t) = t + b.If b is not constant, then we need b(t) = b(t - b(t)) for all t. Let me check if there are non-constant solutions. Suppose b(t) = c(t), then c(t) = c(t - c(t)). Let's try simple functions. Let’s try c(t) = kt, linear function. Then, c(t) = kt, so c(t - c(t)) = k(t - kt) = kt - k^2 t = kt(1 - k). Setting this equal to c(t) = kt:kt(1 - k) = kt => (1 - k) = 1 => k = 0. So only solution is k = 0, which gives b(t) = 0, the constant function. So no non-trivial linear solutions.What about quadratic? Let’s suppose c(t) = at^2 + bt + c. Then c(t - c(t)) = a(t - c(t))^2 + b(t - c(t)) + c. This seems too complicated, and setting equal to c(t) would require solving a functional equation which likely only has constant solutions.Alternatively, suppose c(t) is periodic. For example, c(t + T) = c(t). Then, the equation c(t) = c(t - c(t)) would require that t - c(t) is also a period shift. But this seems difficult to satisfy unless c(t) is constant.Alternatively, perhaps only constant functions satisfy c(t) = c(t - c(t)). Therefore, the only solutions are f(t) = t + b. Therefore, combining all this, it seems that the only monotonic bijections satisfying the given condition are the linear functions f(t) = t + b for some constant b.But let's check if there could be any non-linear solutions. Suppose f is a non-linear monotonic bijection. For example, take f(t) = t + e^t. This function is strictly increasing since its derivative is 1 + e^t > 0 for all t. It's bijective because as t approaches -∞, f(t) approaches -∞, and as t approaches +∞, f(t) approaches +∞. So it's invertible. Let’s compute f⁻¹(t). Let’s set y = t + e^t. To find f⁻¹(y) = t, we need to solve y = t + e^t for t. This equation is transcendental and cannot be solved analytically, but let's check if f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t.Suppose for a specific t, we have y = t + e^t. Then f⁻¹(y) = t. Then, f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = y + f⁻¹(t). But f⁻¹(t) is the value s such that s + e^s = t. So unless s + e^s = t and y = t + e^t, this would need to satisfy y + s = 2t. Substituting y = t + e^t and s = f⁻�¹(t), which is s such that s + e^s = t. So the equation becomes (t + e^t) + s = 2t. Therefore, e^t + s = t. But s is defined by s + e^s = t. Therefore, substituting s = t - e^t into s + e^s = t gives (t - e^t) + e^{t - e^t} = t. Therefore, e^{t - e^t} = e^t. Taking natural logarithm: t - e^t = t => -e^t = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, f(t) = t + e^t does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, such a function is not a solution.Therefore, it seems that non-linear functions do not satisfy the equation. Hence, the only solutions are linear functions of the form f(t) = t + b.But let me check another example. Suppose f(t) = t for t < 0 and f(t) = t + 1 for t ≥ 0. This function is strictly increasing, bijective (since every real number is covered: for t < 0, f(t) = t; for t ≥ 0, f(t) = t + 1, so the inverse is f⁻¹(t) = t for t < 0 and f⁻¹(t) = t - 1 for t ≥ 1. The interval [0,1) is not covered in the range, hence f is not surjective. Therefore, this function is not bijective. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, make a piecewise function that is surjective. For example, f(t) = t for t ≤ 0 and f(t) = t + 1 for t > 0. Then the inverse would be f⁻¹(t) = t for t ≤ 0 and f⁻¹(t) = t - 1 for t > 0. Wait, but then for t > 0, f(t) = t + 1, so the inverse function for y > 1 is f⁻¹(y) = y - 1. For y ≤ 0, f⁻¹(y) = y. But for 0 < y ≤ 1, there is no t such that f(t) = y because for t ≤ 0, f(t) = t ≤ 0, and for t > 0, f(t) = t + 1 > 1. Therefore, this function is not surjective on ℝ, hence not bijective. Therefore, such piecewise functions won't work unless they cover all real numbers.Therefore, constructing a non-linear bijective function that satisfies f(t) + f⁻¹(t) = 2t is difficult. All the examples I can think of either fail to be bijective or don't satisfy the equation.Therefore, based on the differential equation approach, substitution tests, and trying examples, it seems the only solutions are the linear functions f(t) = t + b where b is a real constant. These functions are bijective, monotonic (since they're strictly increasing with derivative 1), and satisfy the given functional equation.Therefore, the elements of E that are monotonic are precisely all the linear functions of the form f(t) = t + b for some constant b ∈ ℝ.Final AnswerAll such functions are linear; the solutions are precisely the functions ( f(t) = t + c ) for some constant ( c ). Thus, the answer is (boxed{f(t) = t + c}) where ( c ) is a real constant.</think>Given the problem of finding all bijective and monotonic mappings ( f ) from (mathbb{R}) to (mathbb{R}) that satisfy the equation ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t ) for all ( t in mathbb{R} ), we start by analyzing the functional equation and its implications.1. Functional Equation Analysis:   - For any ( t in mathbb{R} ), the equation ( f(t) + f^{-1}(t) = 2t ) must hold.   - By substituting ( y = f(t) ), we get ( t = f^{-1}(y) ), leading to the equation ( y + f^{-1}(y) = 2f^{-1}(y) ). This simplifies to ( y = f^{-1}(y) ), suggesting ( f(y) = y ). However, further analysis shows this is not the only solution.2. Linear Function Check:   - Assume ( f(t) = at + b ). The inverse function is ( f^{-1(t)} = frac{t - b}{a} ).   - Substituting into the equation, we get ( at + b + frac{t - b}{a} = 2t ). Solving for ( a ) and ( b ), we find ( a = 1 ) and ( b ) can be any real number. Thus, ( f(t) = t + b ) satisfies the equation.3. Verification of Linear Solutions:   - For ( f(t) = t + b ), the inverse is ( f^{-1}(t) = t - b ). Substituting back, we get ( (t + b) + (t - b) = 2t ), which holds true.   - Differentiating the equation confirms that the derivative ( f'(t) = 1 ), ensuring monotonicity.4. Non-linear Function Consideration:   - Attempts to construct non-linear solutions (e.g., exponential, piecewise) either fail to be bijective or do not satisfy the functional equation.   - Differential equation analysis shows that non-linear solutions would require complex conditions not satisfied by simple non-linear functions.5. Conclusion:   - The only solutions that are bijective, monotonic, and satisfy the functional equation are linear functions of the form ( f(t) = t + b ).Thus, the elements of ( E ) that are monotonic mappings are precisely the functions ( f(t) = t + c ) for some constant ( c in mathbb{R} ).[boxed{f(t) = t + c}] where ( c ) is a real constant.]"},{"problem":"I5.1 Two opposite sides of a rectangle are increased by 50 % while the other two are decreased by 20 %.

The problem is about a rectangle where two opposite sides are increased by 50%, and the other two sides are decreased by 20%. Then we need to find the percentage increase in the area, which is given as 'a%'. Hmm, so I need to figure out how changing the length and width by those percentages affects the area. Let me break this down step by step.First, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. So if the original length is, say, 'l' and the original width is 'w', the original area would be A = l * w. Now, the problem says two opposite sides are increased by 50%, and the other two are decreased by 20%. I need to make sure I interpret this correctly. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, increasing two opposite sides (which are equal) by 50% and decreasing the other two opposite sides (which are the other pair) by 20%. So essentially, one pair of sides is increased by 50%, and the other pair is decreased by 20%. So this would mean that if the original length is 'l' and the original width is 'w', then after the change, the new length would be... hmm, actually, wait. It's not specified whether the length or the width is being changed. Maybe I should assign variables to the original sides and then apply the percentage changes accordingly.Let me define the original sides as length 'l' and width 'w'. The problem doesn't specify which sides are being increased or decreased, just that two opposite sides are increased by 50% and the other two are decreased by 20%. So perhaps it doesn't matter which ones we choose as length or width, since multiplication is commutative. So let's say we increase the length by 50% and decrease the width by 20%. Wait, but actually, if two opposite sides are increased, that would mean both the length and the width? Wait, no. A rectangle has two sides of each. So if two opposite sides (which are lengths) are increased by 50%, and the other two opposite sides (which are widths) are decreased by 20%. So, actually, the length becomes longer by 50%, and the width becomes shorter by 20%. Is that the correct interpretation? Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if you have two sides (lengths) increased by 50%, then both of those sides are increased, and the other two sides (widths) are decreased by 20%. So the new length would be original length plus 50% of it, and the new width would be original width minus 20% of it. Then the new area would be new length times new width. Then the percentage increase in area would be (new area - original area)/original area * 100%. Then that's 'a%'. So the answer is a = [(new area/original area - 1) * 100]. Let's compute that.Let me write this out step by step.Original length = lOriginal width = wOriginal area = l * wAfter the changes:New length = l + 50% of l = l * (1 + 0.5) = 1.5lNew width = w - 20% of w = w * (1 - 0.2) = 0.8wTherefore, new area = new length * new width = 1.5l * 0.8w = (1.5 * 0.8) * l * w = 1.2 * l * wSo the new area is 1.2 times the original area.Therefore, the increase in area is 1.2 - 1 = 0.2, which is 20%.Therefore, a = 20.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says two opposite sides are increased by 50% while the other two are decreased by 20%. So depending on which sides you choose to increase or decrease, does it make a difference? Let's see. Suppose instead of changing the length, you changed the width. But in a rectangle, length and width are just labels; switching them doesn't affect the area. So increasing one pair by 50% and decreasing the other pair by 20% would result in the same area regardless of which pair you choose. So the calculation remains the same.Alternatively, maybe I can test with numbers. Let me take an example. Suppose the original rectangle is 10 units by 10 units, so it's a square. Original area is 100.If I increase two opposite sides (lengths) by 50%, so new length is 10 + 5 = 15. Decrease the other two sides (widths) by 20%, so new width is 10 - 2 = 8. Then new area is 15 * 8 = 120. The original area was 100, so the increase is 20. Therefore, 20% increase. So a = 20. That's the same result as before. So that seems to check out.Alternatively, if the original rectangle is 20 by 5. Original area is 100. Increase length by 50%: 20 * 1.5 = 30. Decrease width by 20%: 5 * 0.8 = 4. New area is 30 * 4 = 120. Again, 20% increase. So the percentage increase is consistent regardless of original dimensions. So seems like a is 20.Therefore, the answer is 20. Therefore, a = 20. So the area is increased by 20%.But wait, let me check another example to be thorough. Let's say original rectangle is 2 by 3. Area is 6. Increase the length by 50%: 2 * 1.5 = 3. Decrease the width by 20%: 3 * 0.8 = 2.4. New area is 3 * 2.4 = 7.2. The increase is 7.2 - 6 = 1.2. 1.2 / 6 = 0.2, so 20% increase. Same result. So regardless of the original dimensions, the percentage increase in area is 20%. Therefore, a = 20. So the answer is 20.But let me think again. Is there another way someone might misinterpret this problem? For example, if someone thought that all four sides are adjusted, but no, the problem says two opposite sides are increased by 50%, while the other two are decreased by 20%. In a rectangle, two opposite sides are length and the other two are width. So you can't have all four sides adjusted unless it's a square. So in general, for a rectangle, you have two pairs of equal sides. So changing two opposite sides (a pair) by 50% and the other pair by 20%. So the calculation is straightforward as we did before. So I think the answer is correct.Another way: Suppose the original sides are x and y. Then the new sides are 1.5x and 0.8y. So area becomes 1.5x * 0.8y = 1.2xy. So 1.2 times original area, which is 20% increase. So same result. Yeah, this seems solid.Therefore, the answer is 20. So a = 20.Final AnswerThe value of ( a ) is boxed{20}.</think>Let the original length and width of the rectangle be ( l ) and ( w ) respectively. The original area of the rectangle is ( A = l times w ).When two opposite sides (length) are increased by 50%, the new length becomes:[1.5l]When the other two opposite sides (width) are decreased by 20%, the new width becomes:[0.8w]The new area of the rectangle is:[text{New Area} = 1.5l times 0.8w = 1.2lw]The increase in area is:[1.2lw - lw = 0.2lw]The percentage increase in area is:[left( frac{0.2lw}{lw} right) times 100% = 20%]Thus, the value of ( a ) is (boxed{20}).,<think>Okay, so here's this problem: we have a rectangle, and two opposite sides are increased by 50%, while the other two are decreased by 20%. Then, we need to find the percentage increase in the area, which is denoted by 'a'. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First off, let's recall that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. So, if we change the length and the width, the area will change accordingly. The problem says two opposite sides are increased by 50%, and the other two are decreased by 20%. Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, this means that one pair of sides (let's say the length) is being increased by 50%, and the other pair (the width) is being decreased by 20%. Or it could be the other way around, but since multiplication is commutative, it doesn't really matter which one is which. The result should be the same.Let me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's denote the original length as L and the original width as W. Therefore, the original area is A = L * W.Now, according to the problem, two opposite sides are increased by 50%. So, if we take the length as being increased by 50%, the new length becomes L + 50% of L, which is L * (1 + 0.50) = 1.5L. Similarly, the other two sides (the width) are decreased by 20%, so the new width is W - 20% of W = W * (1 - 0.20) = 0.8W.Therefore, the new area after the changes will be A' = new length * new width = 1.5L * 0.8W. Let me compute that: 1.5 * 0.8 = 1.2, so A' = 1.2 * L * W = 1.2A. Wait, so the new area is 1.2 times the original area. That means the area has increased by 0.2 times the original area, right? So, 0.2 is equivalent to 20%, which would make 'a' equal to 20. But hold on, let me make sure I did that correctly.Wait, 1.5 multiplied by 0.8... Let me check that arithmetic again. 1.5 times 0.8. Hmm, 1 times 0.8 is 0.8, and 0.5 times 0.8 is 0.4, so adding them together gives 0.8 + 0.4 = 1.2. Yep, that's correct. So the new area is indeed 1.2 times the original area, which is a 20% increase. So, a = 20. Therefore, the answer should be 20. But let me think again to ensure there isn't a trick here.Wait, the problem says \\"two opposite sides are increased by 50% while the other two are decreased by 20%\\". So, if the rectangle has length L and width W, increasing two opposite sides (say, the lengths) by 50% gives 1.5L, and decreasing the other two (widths) by 20% gives 0.8W. Then, the area becomes 1.5L * 0.8W = 1.2LW, which is indeed a 20% increase. So, the percentage increase 'a' is 20. That seems straightforward.But maybe I should verify this with actual numbers to be sure. Let's pick specific values for L and W. Suppose the original length is 10 units and the original width is 5 units. Then, the original area is 10 * 5 = 50 square units.After increasing the length by 50%, the new length is 10 + 5 = 15 units. After decreasing the width by 20%, the new width is 5 - 1 = 4 units. The new area is 15 * 4 = 60 square units. Comparing the new area to the original area: 60 - 50 = 10, which is an increase of 10 units. The percentage increase is (10/50)*100 = 20%. So, that's a 20% increase. Hmm, so the answer is indeed 20.Wait, but maybe I need to present this in terms of variables, not specific numbers. Let me do that again. Let the original length be L and original width be W. Then, original area is LW. The new dimensions are 1.5L and 0.8W. The new area is 1.5L * 0.8W = (1.5 * 0.8)LW = 1.2LW. So, the new area is 1.2 times the original area, which is a 20% increase. So, the value of 'a' is 20.But wait, the problem says \\"the area of the rectangle is increased by a%\\", so they want to know by what percentage the area has increased. So, since 1.2 times the original area is a 20% increase, then a = 20. Therefore, the answer should be 20.Is there any chance that the problem is referring to something else? For example, maybe the sides are increased and decreased in a different way? Wait, the problem says \\"two opposite sides are increased by 50% while the other two are decreased by 20%\\". In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so increasing two opposite sides by 50% would mean both of those sides become 1.5 times their original length, and the other two sides (the other pair of opposite sides) are decreased by 20%, so they become 0.8 times their original length. Therefore, the area is 1.5 * 0.8 = 1.2 times the original area, so 20% increase. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, if the sides were adjacent sides, but no, the problem says opposite sides. So, in a rectangle, each pair of opposite sides are of equal length, so increasing two opposite sides (length) and decreasing the other two opposite sides (width). Therefore, the calculations hold.Alternatively, if they had increased one length and one width, but no, the problem states \\"two opposite sides\\", so both of the same dimension. So, for example, both lengths are increased, and both widths are decreased. So, no ambiguity there.Hence, I think my answer is correct. The area increases by 20%, so a = 20.Final AnswerThe value of ( a ) is boxed{20}.</think>Let the original length of the rectangle be ( L ) and the original width be ( W ).

So, maybe I can first find the solutions to a³ ≡ 1 mod 24, and then count how many such a's there are less than 100.But solving a³ ≡ 1 mod 24. Since 24 is 8×3, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to break this into modulo 8 and modulo 3.So, if I can find a such that:a³ ≡ 1 mod 8 and a³ ≡ 1 mod 3,then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, a³ ≡ 1 mod 24.So, let me first solve a³ ≡ 1 mod 8.What are the cubes modulo 8?Let's compute a³ mod 8 for a from 0 to 7:0³ = 0 mod 81³ = 1 mod 82³ = 8 ≡ 0 mod 83³ = 27 ≡ 3 mod 84³ = 64 ≡ 0 mod 85³ = 125 ≡ 5 mod 86³ = 216 ≡ 0 mod 87³ = 343 ≡ 7 mod 8So, the cubes mod 8 are: 0,1,0,3,0,5,0,7.So, a³ ≡ 1 mod 8 only when a ≡ 1 mod 8. Because only when a is 1 mod 8 does the cube equal 1 mod 8. So, for the modulo 8 part, a must be congruent to 1 modulo 8.Similarly, now let's look at modulo 3.We need a³ ≡ 1 mod 3.Let me compute cubes modulo 3:0³ ≡ 0 mod 31³ ≡ 1 mod 32³ = 8 ≡ 2 mod 3So, the cubes modulo 3 are 0,1,2. So, a³ ≡ 1 mod 3 when a ≡ 1 mod 3.Therefore, for the congruence a³ ≡ 1 mod 3, the solution is a ≡ 1 mod 3.Therefore, combining both conditions via Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need a ≡ 1 mod 8 and a ≡ 1 mod 3.So, we need to solve the system of congruences:a ≡ 1 mod 8a ≡ 1 mod 3Find a number that is 1 mod 8 and 1 mod 3.Since 8 and 3 are coprime, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solution is a ≡ 1 mod lcm(8,3)=24.Wait, because 8 and 3 are coprime, the solution is a ≡ 1 mod 24.Wait, let me check that.Suppose a ≡ 1 mod 8 and a ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, let’s write a = 1 + 8k. Substitute into the second congruence:1 + 8k ≡ 1 mod 3 => 8k ≡ 0 mod 3. Since 8 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 2k ≡ 0 mod 3 => k ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, k = 3m. So, a = 1 + 8×3m = 1 + 24m. Therefore, a ≡ 1 mod 24. So, the solutions are numbers congruent to 1 modulo 24.Therefore, all a ≡ 1 mod 24 satisfy both a³ ≡ 1 mod 8 and a³ ≡ 1 mod 3, hence a³ ≡ 1 mod 24.Therefore, the numbers a less than 100 that satisfy a ≡ 1 mod 24 are 1, 25, 49, 73, 97. Let me check:Start with 1: 1 + 24 = 25, 25 +24=49, 49+24=73, 73+24=97, 97 +24=121 which is over 100. So, the numbers are 1,25,49,73,97. So that's 5 numbers. So, the answer is 5, which is option B.Wait, but let me double-check. Let's verify if these numbers actually satisfy a³ +23 divisible by 24.Take a=1: 1³ +23 =24, which is divisible by 24. Correct.a=25: 25³. Let's compute 25³. 25²=625, so 25³=625×25. Let me compute that: 600×25=15,000; 25×25=625; so total is 15,000 + 625=15,625. Then 15,625 +23=15,648. Now divide by 24: 15,648 ÷24. 24×600=14,400; 15,648-14,400=1,248. 24×50=1,200; 1,248-1,200=48. 24×2=48. So total is 600+50+2=652. So, 15,648 ÷24=652. So yes, divisible by 24.Similarly, a=49: 49³. Let's compute 49³. 49²=2,401. 2,401×49. Let's compute 2,400×49 +1×49=117,600 +49=117,649. Then 117,649 +23=117,672. Divide by 24: 24×4,900=117,600. 117,672-117,600=72. 72÷24=3. So total is 4,900 +3=4,903. So, 117,672 ÷24=4,903. So, divisible by 24.Similarly, a=73: 73³. Let's compute 73²=5,329. 5,329×73. Let's do 5,300×73=386,900 and 29×73=2,117. So total is 386,900 +2,117=389,017. Then 389,017 +23=389,040. Divide by 24: 24×16,000=384,000. 389,040-384,000=5,040. 24×210=5,040. So total is 16,000 +210=16,210. So, 389,040 ÷24=16,210. Divisible by 24.a=97: 97³. Let's compute 97²=9,409. 9,409×97. Let's do 9,400×97=911,800 and 9×97=873. So total is 911,800 +873=912,673. Then 912,673 +23=912,696. Divide by 24: 24×38,000=912,000. 912,696 -912,000=696. 696 ÷24=29. So total is 38,000 +29=38,029. So, divisible by 24. So all these numbers work.So, that's 5 numbers. So, answer B) 5. So, I think that's correct.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any other numbers less than 100 that satisfy a³ ≡1 mod 24. The reasoning earlier was that the solutions are numbers congruent to 1 mod 24. But is that necessarily the only solutions?Wait, maybe I need to check if there are other residues modulo 24 whose cubes are 1 mod 24. Because perhaps the earlier reasoning that the solutions are only 1 mod 24 is incorrect. Let me check.We broke down the modulus 24 into 8 and 3, and found that a ≡1 mod 8 and a≡1 mod3, leading to a ≡1 mod24. But maybe there are other solutions? Let me check.Suppose there exists a number a not congruent to 1 mod24, but a³ ≡1 mod24. Let's check each residue modulo24.But that would take a while, but perhaps there's a smarter way.Alternatively, recall that the multiplicative group modulo24 is not cyclic, since 24 is not a prime power. The multiplicative group modulo 24 has φ(24)=φ(8×3)=φ(8)φ(3)=4×2=8 elements. So the group of units modulo24 has order 8. The cube map is a group homomorphism. The kernel of this homomorphism would be the elements with a³≡1 mod24. So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of elements of order dividing 3 in the multiplicative group modulo24. But perhaps the multiplicative group modulo24 is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2? Wait, no. Let me recall.Wait, modulo 8, the multiplicative group is C2 × C2, and modulo 3, it's C2. So, the multiplicative group modulo24 is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2? Wait, maybe not. Let me check.Wait, the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that (Z/24Z)^× ≅ (Z/8Z)^××(Z/3Z)^×. Now, (Z/8Z)^× is {1,3,5,7} under multiplication modulo8. This is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, C2 × C2. Similarly, (Z/3Z)^× is {1,2}, which is cyclic of order 2, C2. Therefore, the entire group is C2 × C2 × C2. So, an elementary abelian 2-group of exponent 2. Therefore, every element squared is 1. Wait, but then if every element has order dividing 2, then the cube of any element is equal to the element itself. Therefore, a³ ≡a mod24. Therefore, if a³ ≡1 mod24, then a≡1 mod24. Therefore, the only solution is a≡1 mod24. Therefore, indeed, only numbers congruent to1 mod24 satisfy a³≡1 mod24.Hence, there are no other solutions. Therefore, the numbers less than 100 are 1,25,49,73,97. So, 5 numbers. Therefore, the answer is B)5.But wait, hold on. Let me check with some specific numbers not congruent to1 mod24. Let's take a=5. Then 5³=125. 125 mod24 is 125 -5×24=125-120=5. So, 5³≡5 mod24. Then 5+23=28≡4 mod24. Not divisible by24. So, no. What about a=7. 7³=343. 343 mod24: 24×14=336, 343-336=7. So, 7³≡7 mod24. 7+23=30≡6 mod24. Not divisible. a=9: 9³=729. 729 mod24: 24×30=720. 729-720=9. So, 9³≡9 mod24. 9+23=32≡8 mod24. Not divisible. a=11: 11³=1331. 1331 mod24: 24×55=1320, 1331-1320=11. So, 11≡11 mod24. 11+23=34≡10 mod24. Not divisible. Hmm. How about a=17: 17³=4913. 4913 mod24: 24×204=4896, 4913-4896=17. So, 17³≡17 mod24. 17+23=40≡16 mod24. Not divisible. Okay, so seems like numbers not congruent to1 mod24 do not satisfy the condition. So, only 1 mod24 numbers work.Therefore, the answer is 5. So, option B.Therefore, I think the answer is B)5.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>To determine the number of positive integers ( a ) less than 100 such that ( a^3 + 23 ) is divisible by 24, we need to solve the congruence ( a^3 equiv -23 pmod{24} ). Since (-23 equiv 1 pmod{24}), this simplifies to ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{24} ).We break this down using the Chinese Remainder Theorem into modulo 8 and modulo 3:1. Modulo 8 Analysis:   - We need ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{8} ).   - Checking cubes modulo 8 for ( a = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 7 ), we find that ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{8} ) only when ( a equiv 1 pmod{8} ).2. Modulo 3 Analysis:   - We need ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{3} ).   - Checking cubes modulo 3 for ( a = 0, 1, 2 ), we find that ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{3} ) only when ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} ).Combining these results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we solve the system:- ( a equiv 1 pmod{8} )- ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} )This system has the solution ( a equiv 1 pmod{24} ).Next, we find all positive integers ( a < 100 ) that are congruent to 1 modulo 24:- The numbers are ( 1, 25, 49, 73, 97 ).There are 5 such numbers. Therefore, the number of such ( a ) is (boxed{B}).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem here: Let a be a positive integer, a < 100. And a³ + 23 is divisible by 24. Then the number of such a is... with options given. Hmm. I need to find how many numbers a less than 100 satisfy this divisibility condition. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem states that a³ + 23 is divisible by 24. So that means a³ + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24. Which can be rewritten as a³ ≡ -23 mod 24. But since we're dealing with mod 24, maybe it's better to convert -23 to a positive equivalent. Since -23 mod 24 is the same as 1 mod 24 (because 24 - 23 = 1), so this simplifies to a³ ≡ 1 mod 24. Wait, is that correct?Let me check: If a³ + 23 ≡ 0 mod 24, then adding 23 to both sides gives a³ ≡ -23 mod 24. But -23 is congruent to 1 mod 24 because 24 - 23 = 1. So yes, a³ ≡ 1 mod 24. So essentially, I need all positive integers a < 100 such that when you cube them, they leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 24.So the key equation here is a³ ≡ 1 mod 24. So I need to find all a < 100 where this congruence holds. Then count how many such a there are.Now, to solve this, maybe I should first find the solutions a modulo 24, because if a ≡ b mod 24, then a³ ≡ b³ mod 24. So the solutions will repeat every 24 numbers. So if I can find all residues r modulo 24 where r³ ≡ 1 mod 24, then the numbers a congruent to r mod 24 will satisfy the condition. Then, since a < 100, I can determine how many full cycles of 24 fit into 100, and then check the remaining numbers.So first step: Find all r in {0, 1, 2, ..., 23} such that r³ ≡ 1 mod 24.Let me compute r³ mod 24 for each residue r from 0 to 23. But that might take some time, but maybe there's a smarter way.Alternatively, since 24 = 8 * 3, and 8 and 3 are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, solving r³ ≡ 1 mod 24 is equivalent to solving r³ ≡ 1 mod 8 and r³ ≡ 1 mod 3. Then combine the solutions. That might be easier.So let's split it into mod 8 and mod 3.First, mod 8: r³ ≡ 1 mod 8.Let's compute r³ mod 8 for r = 0 to 7:0³ = 0 mod 81³ = 1 mod 82³ = 8 ≡ 0 mod 83³ = 27 ≡ 3 mod 84³ = 64 ≡ 0 mod 85³ = 125 ≡ 5 mod 86³ = 216 ≡ 0 mod 87³ = 343 ≡ 7 mod 8So the residues r mod 8 where r³ ≡ 1 mod 8 are only r ≡ 1 mod 8. Because only 1³ ≡ 1 mod 8. So in mod 8, the solution is r ≡ 1.Now mod 3: r³ ≡ 1 mod 3.Similarly, compute r³ mod 3 for r = 0, 1, 2:0³ = 0 mod 31³ = 1 mod 32³ = 8 ≡ 2 mod 3So the residues r mod 3 where r³ ≡ 1 mod 3 is only r ≡ 1 mod 3.Therefore, combining these two using Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need numbers r such that:r ≡ 1 mod 8r ≡ 1 mod 3So find r that satisfies both congruences.Let me solve this system. Let r ≡ 1 mod 8. So r = 8k + 1 for some integer k. Then substitute into the second equation: 8k + 1 ≡ 1 mod 3. Simplify: 8k ≡ 0 mod 3. Since 8 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 2k ≡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, 2k ≡ 0 mod 3 => k ≡ 0 mod 3 (since 2 and 3 are coprime, we can multiply both sides by 2⁻¹ mod 3, which is 2, since 2*2=4≡1 mod3). Therefore, k ≡ 0 mod 3. So k = 3m for some integer m. Then r = 8*(3m) + 1 = 24m + 1. Therefore, the solutions modulo 24 are r ≡ 1 mod 24. So the only solution modulo 24 is 1. Wait, is that correct?Wait, let me verify. If r ≡1 mod8 and r≡1 mod3, then r ≡1 mod lcm(8,3)=24. So yes, the only solution modulo 24 is r ≡1 mod24. So that would mean that the only residue mod24 for which r³≡1 mod24 is r≡1 mod24. Therefore, all numbers congruent to 1 modulo24 will satisfy a³≡1 mod24.Wait, but that seems too restrictive. Let me check.For example, take r=1: 1³=1≡1 mod24. Correct.Take r=25, which is 1 mod24: 25³. But 25=24+1, so 25³=(24+1)³. Expanding this, all terms except 1³ will have a factor of 24, so 25³≡1 mod24. So that works.But what about another number, say r=13. Let me compute 13³ mod24.13 mod24 is 13. 13²=169. 169 mod24: 24*7=168, 169-168=1. So 13²≡1 mod24. Then 13³=13²*13≡1*13=13 mod24. Which is not 1 mod24. So 13³≡13 mod24. So 13 is not a solution. So perhaps only 1 mod24 works.Wait, but let me check another number. Let's take r=5. 5³=125. 125 divided by24: 24*5=120, 125-120=5. So 5³≡5 mod24≠1. So not 1.How about r=7. 7³=343. 343 divided by24: 24*14=336, 343-336=7. So 7³≡7 mod24. Not 1.How about r=17. 17³=4913. Let's divide by24: 24*204=4896, 4913-4896=17. So 17³≡17 mod24. So same as the number itself. Interesting.Wait, so maybe in mod24, for some numbers, r³≡r mod24. Let's test a few:r=1: 1³=1≡1r=3: 27≡3 mod24r=5:125≡5 mod24r=7:343≡7 mod24r=9:9³=729. 729-24*30=729-720=9. So 9³≡9 mod24.Wait, so seems like for odd numbers, r³≡r mod24? Let me test r=2:2³=8≡8 mod24. So 8≠2.r=4:64≡16 mod24. 16≠4.So for even numbers, it's different, but for odd numbers, is r³≡r mod24? Let's see.Take r=11: 11³=1331. 1331 divided by24: 24*55=1320, 1331-1320=11. So 11³≡11 mod24.Similarly, r=13: As before, 13³≡13 mod24.r=15:15³=3375. 3375-24*140=3375-3360=15. So 15³≡15 mod24.So indeed, it seems like for odd r, r³≡r mod24. Is that a general rule?Wait, let me check in mod8 and mod3.For odd r: Any odd integer is congruent to 1, 3, 5, 7 mod8.We saw that in mod8, r³≡r mod8. For example:1³≡1, 3³≡3, 5³≡5, 7³≡7 mod8. So indeed, for odd r, r³≡r mod8.Similarly, in mod3: For any integer r, r³≡r mod3 (by Fermat's little theorem, since 3 is prime, so r³≡r mod3).Therefore, combining these via Chinese Remainder Theorem, if r is odd, then r³≡r mod8 and r³≡r mod3, hence r³≡r mod24. Therefore, for odd r, r³≡r mod24.Therefore, if r is odd, then r³ ≡ r mod24. So in order for r³ ≡1 mod24, we must have r ≡1 mod24.But wait, let's see: If r is odd, then r³ ≡ r mod24. Therefore, the equation r³ ≡1 mod24 becomes r ≡1 mod24. Therefore, the only solution is r ≡1 mod24.However, if r is even, then r³ is even. But 1 mod24 is odd, so even numbers can't be solutions. Therefore, only odd numbers can satisfy r³≡1 mod24, and among them, only those congruent to1 mod24.Therefore, the solutions are numbers congruent to1 mod24.Therefore, in the range from1 to 99 (since a <100 and positive integer), the numbers congruent to1 mod24 are1,25,49,73,97.Wait, 1 +24=25, +24=49, +24=73, +24=97, +24=121 which is over100. So 1,25,49,73,97: that's five numbers.But the options are (A)4; (B)5; (C)9; (D)10. So answer is B)5.Wait, but wait. Let me verify again.If a ≡1 mod24, then a³ ≡1 mod24. Therefore, a³ +23 ≡1 +23=24≡0 mod24, which satisfies the condition.But is there another residue mod24 that could satisfy a³ ≡1 mod24? Earlier, when I tested some numbers like13,17, etc., their cubes were congruent to themselves mod24, not1. So perhaps only1 mod24 works.But just to be thorough, let's check all residues from1 to23 odd numbers:Check r=1:1³=1≡1. Good.r=3:3³=27≡3 mod24. Not1.r=5:5³=125≡5 mod24. Not1.r=7:7³=343≡7 mod24. Not1.r=9:9³=729≡9 mod24. Not1.r=11:11³=1331≡11 mod24. Not1.r=13:13³=2197≡13 mod24. Not1.r=15:15³=3375≡15 mod24. Not1.r=17:17³=4913≡17 mod24. Not1.r=19:19³=6859≡19 mod24. Not1.r=21:21³=9261≡21 mod24. Not1.r=23:23³=12167≡23 mod24. Not1.So indeed, only r=1 mod24 satisfies r³≡1 mod24. Therefore, the numbers a≡1 mod24 less than100 are1,25,49,73,97. So five numbers. So answer is B)5.But wait, hold on. Let me check 97. 97 is less than100. Then the next one would be97 +24=121, which is over100. So yes, only five numbers.But let me check if a=1:1³+23=24, which is divisible by24. Correct.a=25:25³ +23. 25³=15625. 15625 +23=15648. Divided by24:15648 ÷24=652. So yes, divisible.Similarly, 49³=117649. 117649 +23=117672. 117672 ÷24=4903. So yes.73³=389017. 389017 +23=389040. Divided by24:389040 ÷24=16210. So yes.97³=912673. 912673 +23=912696. Divided by24:912696 ÷24=38029. So that's divisible.All five numbers work. So the answer is5, optionB.But wait, the options given are(A)4; (B)5; (C)9; (D)10. So why isn't it 10? Maybe I missed something.Wait, maybe my initial assumption that only a≡1 mod24 works is incorrect. Wait, perhaps there are other residues mod24 where a³ ≡1 mod24. Let me double-check.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me go through that again.We have a³ ≡1 mod24. To solve this congruence, since24=8*3, and8 and3 are coprime, we solve a³≡1 mod8 and a³≡1 mod3, then combine the solutions.For mod8: As before, the only solution is a≡1 mod8.For mod3: As before, a³≡1 mod3. By Fermat's little theorem, since3 is prime, a²≡1 mod3 for a not divisible by3. So a³≡a mod3. Therefore, a³≡1 mod3 implies a≡1 mod3.Therefore, combining a≡1 mod8 and a≡1 mod3 gives a≡1 mod24. So yes, only a≡1 mod24.Therefore, the solutions are a≡1 mod24, which under100 gives five numbers:1,25,49,73,97. Therefore, answer is5.But let me check another way. Suppose instead of using Chinese Remainder Theorem, I check a³≡1 mod24 directly for a from1 to24.

The problem says a is a positive integer, a<100. So the numbers are1,25,49,73,97. That's five numbers, right? So answer isB)5. Therefore, the correct answer should beB. So why is optionD)10 here?

So maybe the answer isB.But perhaps there's an error in the modulus. Let me check again the original problem: a³ +23 divisible by24. So a³ ≡ -23 mod24. Since-23 mod24 is1, so a³ ≡1 mod24. So correct.But maybe there's another approach where a³ ≡1 mod24, but perhaps considering that a can be even? But wait, if a is even, then a³ is even, and 1 mod24 is odd, so even numbers can't satisfy a³≡1 mod24. Therefore, only odd numbers. Which we have considered.But according to the calculations, only1,25,49,73,97 are the numbers less than100 congruent to1 mod24. That's five numbers. So answer is5. OptionB.Therefore, the correct answer isB)5.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given a positive integer ( a ) such that ( a < 100 ) and ( a^3 + 23 ) is divisible by 24, we need to find the number of such ( a ).First, we rewrite the condition ( a^3 + 23 equiv 0 pmod{24} ) as ( a^3 equiv -23 pmod{24} ). Since (-23 equiv 1 pmod{24}), this simplifies to ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{24} ).To solve ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{24} ), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by considering modulo 8 and modulo 3 separately:1. Modulo 8: We need ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{8} ). Checking cubes modulo 8, only ( a equiv 1 pmod{8} ) satisfies this.2. Modulo 3: We need ( a^3 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( a^3 equiv a pmod{3} ), so ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} ).Combining these results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find ( a equiv 1 pmod{24} ).Next, we list the numbers less than 100 that are congruent to 1 modulo 24:[ 1, 25, 49, 73, 97 ]These are five numbers in total.

Let me first make sure I understand the example they gave. For √10005, they noticed that 10005 is 100² + 5. Then they used the approximation formula (a + h/(2a))² ≈ a² + h, which gives √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a). So in that case, a was 100 and h was 5. Plugging in those numbers gives 100 + 5/(2*100) = 100 + 0.025 = 100.025. And they said that's the approximate value of √10005.Alright, so for √14406, I need to express 14406 as a square of some number a plus a small h, such that h/(2a) is less than 0.1. Let's see... 144 is a square number, right? 12² is 144, but wait, 14400 is 120². Let me check:120² = 14400. So 14406 is 14400 + 6. Therefore, similar to the example, we can let a = 120 and h = 6. Let's check if h/(2a) is less than 0.1. So h is 6, 2a is 240, so 6/240 = 0.025. Which is less than 0.1. So that's good, the approximation should work.So then using the formula √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a). Plugging in a = 120 and h = 6:Approximation = 120 + 6/(2*120) = 120 + 6/240 = 120 + 0.025 = 120.025.So is that it? That seems straightforward, but let me verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Wait, 120² is 14400. Then 14400 + 6 = 14406. So the square root of 14406 should be slightly more than 120. The approximation formula adds h/(2a) which is 6/(2*120) = 6/240 = 0.025. So 120 + 0.025 = 120.025. That seems right.But maybe I should check if there's another a that could be closer. For example, maybe a = 120.025? Wait, but that would be circular because we are trying to approximate √14406. Let me see. Let's compute the actual square root of 14406 to check how accurate this approximation is.Using a calculator, √14406. Let's compute that. Since 120² = 14400, 120.025² = (120 + 0.025)² = 120² + 2*120*0.025 + 0.025² = 14400 + 6 + 0.000625 = 14406.000625. So the square of 120.025 is 14406.000625, which is very close to 14406. So the actual square root of 14406 should be just a tiny bit less than 120.025, right?But since 120.025 squared is 14406.000625, which is 0.000625 more than 14406. So the actual square root is 120.025 minus some small amount. How small? Let's call the exact value 120.025 - ε, where ε is small.We can approximate ε using linear approximation. Let me think. Let’s denote x = 120.025, then x² = 14406.000625. We want to find x - ε such that (x - ε)² = 14406. Expanding that:x² - 2xε + ε² = 14406We know x² = 14406.000625, so:14406.000625 - 2xε + ε² = 14406Neglecting ε² because ε is very small:14406.000625 - 2xε ≈ 14406Subtract 14406 from both sides:0.000625 ≈ 2xεTherefore, ε ≈ 0.000625 / (2x) = 0.000625 / (2*120.025) ≈ 0.000625 / 240.05 ≈ approximately 2.6 x 10^-6. So ε is roughly 0.0000026. Therefore, the exact square root is approximately 120.025 - 0.0000026 ≈ 120.0249974.So, the approximation 120.025 is extremely close to the actual value. The error is on the order of 0.0000026, which is negligible for most purposes. Therefore, the approximation using the formula is excellent here.So, going back, the answer should be 120.025. Let me just confirm once again.Original problem: √14406. Expressed as a² + h where a is 120, h is 6. Then using the formula √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a). So 120 + 6/(2*120) = 120 + 6/240 = 120 + 0.025 = 120.025. Yep, that's the same as before. And the verification shows it's a very good approximation. So I think that's the right answer.Final AnswerThe approximate value of √14406 is boxed{120.025}.</think>To approximate the value of (sqrt{14406}), we use the given formula (sqrt{a^2 + h} approx a + frac{h}{2a}) where (a) is a positive number and (h) is a small positive number such that (frac{h}{2a} < 0.1).First, we express 14406 as (a^2 + h). Recognizing that (14400 = 120^2), we can let (a = 120) and (h = 6). This gives us:[14406 = 120^2 + 6]Next, we check if (frac{h}{2a}) is sufficiently small:[frac{h}{2a} = frac{6}{2 times 120} = frac{6}{240} = 0.025]Since (0.025 < 0.1), the approximation is valid.Using the formula (sqrt{a^2 + h} approx a + frac{h}{2a}), we substitute (a = 120) and (h = 6):[sqrt{14406} approx 120 + frac{6}{2 times 120} = 120 + frac{6}{240} = 120 + 0.025 = 120.025]Verification shows that the approximation is very close to the actual value. Therefore, the approximate value of (sqrt{14406}) is (boxed{120.025}).,<think>Okay, so I need to calculate the approximate value of √14406 using the method described. Let me see. The example they gave was √10005, which they approximated by breaking it down into 100² + 5, then using the formula √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a). Got it.First, let me try to apply the same logic to √14406. Let's see, 144 is 12 squared, so 14400 is 120 squared. Wait, 120² is 14400, right? 120*120=14400. So 14406 is 14400 + 6. So that would be similar to the example, but here a is 120 and h is 6.So according to the formula, √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a). So substituting the values, a = 120 and h = 6. Then the approximation would be 120 + 6/(2*120). Let me compute that.First, calculate the denominator: 2*120 = 240. Then divide h by that: 6/240. Let me simplify that. 6 divided by 240. Hmm, 6 divided by 240. Well, 240 divided by 6 is 40, so 6/240 is 1/40. 1/40 is 0.025. So adding that to 120 gives 120.025. So √14406 ≈ 120.025?Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did everything right. Let's verify the steps again.First, express 14406 as a² + h where a is a perfect square. Since 14400 is 120², then 14406 = 120² + 6. So a = 120, h = 6. Then according to the formula, the approximate square root is a + h/(2a). So plugging in the numbers: 120 + 6/(2*120) = 120 + 6/240 = 120 + 0.025 = 120.025. That seems correct.But let me check if the condition (h/(2a)) < 0.1 is satisfied here. h is 6, a is 120. So h/(2a) is 6/(240) = 0.025, which is less than 0.1. So the approximation is valid. Therefore, the term (h/(2a))² is (0.025)² = 0.000625, which is considered negligible in this case. So the approximation should be pretty good.Let me confirm this with a calculator. Let me compute √14406. Let's see, 120² = 14400. So √14400 is 120. Then √14406 is a bit more. Let's calculate the exact value. Let's use a calculator.But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can compute it using the linear approximation. Alternatively, use the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Wait, if we take the approximation √(a² + h) ≈ a + h/(2a), then the next term in the expansion is h²/(8a³), but since h/(2a) is small, the square of that is negligible. So the error term would be roughly h²/(8a³). Let's compute that.h is 6, a is 120. So h² = 36, 8a³ = 8*(120)^3 = 8*1728000 = 13824000. Then 36/13824000 = 0.0000026 approximately. So the error is about 0.0000026, which is very small. So the approximation 120.025 is accurate up to six decimal places, maybe. But the example had a similar small error.Alternatively, maybe check by squaring 120.025. Let's see:(120 + 0.025)² = 120² + 2*120*0.025 + 0.025² = 14400 + 6 + 0.000625 = 14406 + 0.000625 = 14406.000625. So the square of 120.025 is 14406.000625, which is just slightly more than 14406. So the actual √14406 is a bit less than 120.025. But since the problem asks for the approximate value using this method, the answer is 120.025. However, let me check if they want perhaps a different form or decimal places.Wait, in the example, √10005 was approximated as 100.025, which is three decimal places. So maybe the answer here is 120.025 as well, with the same number of decimal places. So unless there's a miscalculation on my part, that should be correct.But let me double-check. Did I take h = 6? Yes, because 14406 - 120² = 6. So h is 6. Then h/(2a) is 6/(240) = 0.025. Then added to a, which is 120, gives 120.025. Yep.Alternatively, let's think if there's another way to represent 14406 as a square plus a small h. For example, maybe 144 is 12², but 144*100 is 14400, which is 120². So 14406 is indeed 120² + 6. So that's the right decomposition.Alternatively, could someone think of 14406 as 144*100 + 6, but that's the same as 120² + 6.Alternatively, is there another a and h such that a² + h = 14406, but maybe with a different a? For example, take a = 119, but 119² is 14161, which is 14406 - 14161 = 245. Then h would be 245, which is much larger, and h/(2a) would be 245/(238) ≈ 1.03, which is way larger than 0.1, so that approximation would not be valid. So 120 is the right choice for a.Alternatively, a=121, 121² is 14641, which is larger than 14406, so that's not helpful. So definitely a=120 is the correct base.Therefore, the approximate value is 120.025.Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps compute the actual square root using another method? For example, using linear approximation or Newton-Raphson?Let me try the Newton-Raphson method to approximate √14406. The Newton-Raphson method uses the formula x_{n+1} = (x_n + S/x_n)/2, where S is the number we want to find the square root of.Let me start with an initial guess x0 = 120.025, as per the approximation. Then compute x1:x1 = (120.025 + 14406 / 120.025)/2.First, compute 14406 / 120.025. Let's do this division.120.025 * 120 = 14403, so 14406 / 120.025 = (14403 + 3)/120.025 = 120 + 3/120.025.3 divided by 120.025. Let's compute that:3 / 120.025 ≈ 3 / 120 ≈ 0.025, but since the denominator is slightly more than 120, the result is slightly less than 0.025. Let's compute 3 / 120.025.120.025 = 120 + 0.025, so using the approximation for small x: 1/(120 + x) ≈ 1/120 - x/(120)^2.Here x = 0.025, so 1/(120.025) ≈ 1/120 - 0.025/(120)^2.1/120 ≈ 0.008333333...0.025/(14400) ≈ 0.0000017361So 1/120.025 ≈ 0.008333333... - 0.0000017361 ≈ 0.008331597Therefore, 3/120.025 ≈ 3 * 0.008331597 ≈ 0.024994791Therefore, 14406 / 120.025 ≈ 120 + 0.024994791 ≈ 120.024994791Then x1 = (120.025 + 120.024994791)/2 = (240.049994791)/2 ≈ 120.024997395So after one iteration of Newton-Raphson, starting from 120.025, we get approximately 120.0249974, which is very close to the original guess. So the actual square root is approximately 120.0249974, which is slightly less than 120.025, as expected. The difference is about 0.0000026, which matches the error term we calculated earlier. But since the problem asks for the approximate value using the (*) method, which is the first-order approximation, the answer should be 120.025.Therefore, the approximate value of √14406 is 120.025.Final Answerboxed{120.025}</think>Given the problem of approximating the value of (sqrt{14406}) using the method described, we start by expressing 14406 in the form (a^2 + h) where (a) is a perfect square.

Maybe the numerators: 1, 3, 11, 43, 171... Let's see the pattern here. 1*3 - 0 =3, 3*3 +2=11? 3*3=9 +2=11. Then 11*4 -1=43? 11*4=44 -1=43. Then 43*4 -1=171? 43*4=172 -1=171. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each term is previous term *4 - something? Let's see:From 1 to 3: 1*3 +0=33 to 11: 3*3 +2=1111 to 43: 11*4 -1=4343 to 171: 43*4 -1=171Hmm, inconsistent. Maybe another approach.The problem says to define b_n = 1/(a_n - 2). Let me compute b1, b2, b3, etc., from the a_n values.a1 =1, so b1 =1/(1 -2)=1/(-1)= -1a2 =3/2, so b2 =1/(3/2 -2)=1/(-1/2)= -2a3=11/6, so b3=1/(11/6 -2)=1/(11/6 -12/6)=1/(-1/6)= -6a4=43/22, so b4=1/(43/22 -2)=1/(43/22 -44/22)=1/(-1/22)= -22a5=171/86, so b5=1/(171/86 -2)=1/(171/86 -172/86)=1/(-1/86)= -86So the b_n sequence is -1, -2, -6, -22, -86,... Hmm. Let me see the pattern here. From -1 to -2: multiply by 2. Then -2 to -6: multiply by 3. Then -6 to -22: multiply by about 3.666... Hmm, not straightforward. Wait, but looking at the multipliers:From b1=-1 to b2=-2: factor of 2.b2=-2 to b3=-6: factor of 3.b3=-6 to b4=-22: factor of 22/6≈3.666...Wait, perhaps not. Let me compute the differences or see if it's a linear recurrence.Alternatively, maybe express the recurrence relation for b_n. Since we know a_{n+1} =5/2 -1/a_n, and b_n =1/(a_n -2). Maybe we can write a relation between b_{n+1} and b_n.Let me try to express a_n in terms of b_n. Since b_n =1/(a_n -2), then a_n =2 +1/b_n.Then, substituting into the recurrence:a_{n+1} =5/2 -1/a_n =5/2 -1/(2 +1/b_n)Let me compute this:First, compute 1/(2 + 1/b_n). Let's denote x = b_n, so 1/(2 +1/x) =1/( (2x +1)/x )=x/(2x +1)Therefore, a_{n+1} =5/2 -x/(2x +1), where x = b_n.But a_{n+1} =2 +1/b_{n+1}, so:2 +1/b_{n+1} =5/2 -x/(2x +1)Subtract 2 from both sides:1/b_{n+1} =5/2 -2 -x/(2x +1)=1/2 -x/(2x +1)Combine the terms on the right:1/2 -x/(2x +1)= [ (2x +1)/2(2x +1) - 2x /2(2x +1) ]= [ (2x +1 -2x)/2(2x +1) ]=1/(2(2x +1))Therefore, 1/b_{n+1} =1/(2(2x +1)) where x = b_n. Therefore,1/b_{n+1}=1/(2(2b_n +1)) ⇒ b_{n+1}=2(2b_n +1)So, the recurrence is b_{n+1}=4b_n +2. That seems manageable. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me check with the terms we have.Given b1=-1. Then b2=4*(-1)+2=-4+2=-2. Correct. Then b3=4*(-2)+2=-8+2=-6. Correct. Then b4=4*(-6)+2=-24+2=-22. Correct. Then b5=4*(-22)+2=-88+2=-86. Yes, that's exactly the sequence we saw. So the recurrence is b_{n+1}=4b_n +2, with b1=-1.Now, solving this linear recurrence. The general solution for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like b_{n+1} =4b_n +2 can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.The homogeneous equation is b_{n+1}=4b_n, which has solution b_n^{(h)}=C*4^{n}.For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution b_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence:K=4K +2 ⇒ -3K=2 ⇒ K= -2/3.Therefore, the general solution is b_n=C*4^{n} -2/3. Now apply the initial condition b1=-1.Wait, n=1: b1=C*4^1 -2/3=4C -2/3 = -1.So, 4C = -1 +2/3 = -1/3 ⇒ C= (-1/3)/4= -1/12.Therefore, the general formula is b_n= (-1/12)*4^{n} -2/3.Simplify this:First, note that 4^{n}= (2^2)^n=2^{2n}, but perhaps express it as 4^n.Alternatively, factor out constants. Let's see:b_n= (-1/12)*4^n -2/3 = (-4^n)/12 -2/3 = (-4^{n} -8)/12. But maybe we can write it differently.Alternatively, notice that 4^n /12 = 4^{n-1}/3, since 4^n =4*4^{n-1}, so 4^n /12=4^{n-1}/3.Therefore, b_n= -4^{n-1}/3 -2/3= -(4^{n-1} +2)/3.Alternatively, factor out -1/3:b_n= - (4^{n-1} +2)/3.Let me check for n=1: -(4^{0} +2)/3= -(1 +2)/3= -1. Correct. For n=2: -(4^{1} +2)/3= -(4 +2)/3= -6/3= -2. Correct. For n=3: -(4^{2} +2)/3= -(16 +2)/3= -18/3= -6. Correct. For n=4: -(4^3 +2)/3= -(64 +2)/3= -66/3= -22. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, the general formula for b_n is - (4^{n-1} +2)/3. Alternatively, we can write it as b_n= - (4^{n-1} +2)/3. That should be the answer.So part (I) is done. Now part (II): Find the range of values for c that make the inequality a_n < a_{n+1} < 3 always true.Hmm. So the sequence must be increasing and bounded above by 3. So we need to find c such that for all n, a_n < a_{n+1} <3. Let me think about how to approach this.First, note that the sequence is defined recursively: a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n. We need to ensure that each term is less than the next term, and that all terms are less than 3.Given that a1=1. So first, check the initial terms:a1=1, a2=c -1/1= c -1. Since a1 < a2, we need 1 < c -1 ⇒ c > 2.Also, a2 <3 ⇒ c -1 <3 ⇒ c <4.So c must be between 2 and 4 for the first step. But we need this to hold for all n, so we need to ensure that the recursive step continues to satisfy a_n < a_{n+1} <3 for all n.This seems more complex. Maybe we can model the function f(x)=c -1/x, and analyze its behavior. Since a_{n+1}=f(a_n), the sequence is generated by iterating the function f.We want the sequence to be increasing and bounded above by 3. So, if the function f is increasing, and we can find a fixed point at 3, perhaps?First, let's analyze the function f(x)=c -1/x.Its derivative is f’(x)=1/x², which is always positive for x ≠0. So f is increasing on its domain (x ≠0). Therefore, since the function is increasing, if we can ensure that starting from a1=1, each subsequent term is larger than the previous, and all terms are less than 3, then the sequence will converge to a fixed point less than or equal to 3.But since the function is increasing, the fixed point equation is x =c -1/x ⇒ x +1/x =c.So fixed points satisfy x^2 -c x +1=0. The solutions are x=(c ±√(c² -4))/2.For real solutions, c² -4 ≥0 ⇒ c ≥2 or c ≤-2. But since our sequence starts at 1 and c is in the range we are trying to find (probably positive), we can focus on c ≥2.But we need the sequence to be increasing and bounded above by 3. If the sequence converges to a fixed point, then that fixed point must be ≤3. Let's see.Suppose the sequence converges to L. Then L =c -1/L ⇒ L +1/L =c.If L <3, then c = L +1/L. The function g(L)= L +1/L for L>0 has a minimum at L=1, where g(1)=2. For L>1, g(L) is increasing. So as L approaches 3 from below, c approaches 3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333...Wait, so if L is approaching 3, then c approaches 10/3. So if we want the fixed point to be less than 3, then c must be less than 10/3. But wait, but when c=10/3, the fixed point is 3.Wait, let's solve L +1/L =c. If L=3, then c=3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333...So if we set c=10/3, then 3 is a fixed point. So if c <10/3, the fixed point is less than 3, and if c >10/3, the fixed point would be greater than 3.But we need the sequence to be increasing and bounded above by 3. So if c is such that the fixed point is 3, then perhaps the sequence approaches 3 but never exceeds it. However, since the function f(x)=c -1/x is increasing, and if we can show that x < f(x) <3 whenever x <3, then by induction, the sequence would stay increasing and bounded above by 3.So let's formalize this. Suppose that for some n, a_n <3. Then a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n. We need a_{n+1} <3, so c -1/a_n <3 ⇒ c <3 +1/a_n. Since a_n >1 (since the sequence is increasing starting at 1, and c>2 as we saw earlier), 1/a_n <1, so 3 +1/a_n <4. But c must be less than 3 +1/a_n for each n. However, this condition depends on a_n, which complicates things.Alternatively, maybe we can consider that for the inequality a_{n} < a_{n+1} <3 to hold for all n, we need two conditions:1. a_{n+1} >a_n: c -1/a_n >a_n ⇒ c >a_n +1/a_n.2. a_{n+1} <3: c -1/a_n <3 ⇒c <3 +1/a_n.Therefore, for all n, we must have a_n +1/a_n <c <3 +1/a_n.But since a_n is increasing, a_n +1/a_n is also increasing (since a_n increases and 1/a_n decreases, but the sum? Let's check: derivative of x +1/x is 1 -1/x². For x>1, 1 -1/x² >0, so x +1/x is increasing for x>1. Since our sequence starts at 1, and is increasing, a_n ≥1 for all n, and from n=2 onwards, a_n >1. So a_n +1/a_n is increasing. Therefore, the lower bound for c is increasing, and the upper bound 3 +1/a_n is decreasing (since 1/a_n is decreasing). Therefore, the allowable interval for c is shrinking as n increases. Therefore, to satisfy both inequalities for all n, c must be greater than the supremum of a_n +1/a_n and less than the infimum of 3 +1/a_n. Since a_n is increasing and bounded above by 3, the supremum of a_n +1/a_n would be the limit L +1/L where L is the limit of the sequence, which must satisfy L =c -1/L ⇒ L +1/L =c. Similarly, the infimum of 3 +1/a_n is 3 +1/L.Therefore, to have c > L +1/L and c <3 +1/L. But since L +1/L =c, this would require c >c and c <3 +1/L, which is impossible unless we have some other consideration.Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let me think again.If the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 3, it will converge to a limit L ≤3. Then, taking limits on both sides of the recurrence, we have L =c -1/L ⇒ L +1/L =c. So, if L <3, then c =L +1/L <3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333...Therefore, c must be less than 10/3 for L to be less than 3. But also, for the sequence to be increasing, we need that each term a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n >a_n. So c >a_n +1/a_n for all n. Since a_n is increasing, the minimum value of c must be greater than the limit of a_n +1/a_n, which is c itself. Wait, that can't be. If L is the limit, then c = L +1/L, and we need c >a_n +1/a_n for all n. But as n approaches infinity, a_n approaches L, so a_n +1/a_n approaches L +1/L =c. Therefore, for c to be greater than all a_n +1/a_n, which approach c, this would require c >c, which is impossible. Therefore, my initial thought that c must be greater than a_n +1/a_n for all n is not possible unless the inequality is not strict.Wait, maybe I need to revisit the condition for a_{n+1} >a_n.From a_{n+1} >a_n:c -1/a_n >a_n ⇒c >a_n +1/a_n.But if the sequence is converging to L, then in the limit, c =L +1/L. Therefore, if the sequence is increasing, then for all n, c >a_n +1/a_n, but as n increases, a_n approaches L, so a_n +1/a_n approaches c. Therefore, the condition c >a_n +1/a_n for all n would require that c is strictly greater than the limit of a_n +1/a_n, which is c, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that such a c does not exist. But that can't be, since in part (I) with c=5/2=2.5, which is greater than 2, the sequence seems to be increasing towards a limit. Wait, in part (I), c=5/2, which is 2.5. Let's check if the sequence is increasing:We had a1=1, a2=3/2=1.5, a3≈1.833..., a4≈1.954..., a5≈1.988... So actually, in part (I), the sequence is increasing but approaching 2, not 3. Wait, but the fixed point equation L =5/2 -1/L. Solving L +1/L=5/2. Multiply both sides by L: L² +1= (5/2)L ⇒ 2L² -5L +2=0. Using quadratic formula: L=(5±√(25-16))/4=(5±3)/4 ⇒ L=2 or L=1/2. Since the sequence is increasing and starts at 1, it converges to 2. So in that case, the limit is 2, which is less than 3. So for c=5/2, the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2 (hence also by 3), but the problem in part (II) asks for c such that a_n <a_{n+1}<3 always. So in part (I), with c=2.5, the sequence is increasing and bounded by 2, so certainly less than 3. Therefore, the value c=5/2=2.5 is in the range we are supposed to find in part (II).But according to the earlier logic, if the sequence converges to L=2, then c=5/2=2.5, which is equal to L +1/L=2 +1/2=2.5. Therefore, in this case, c= L +1/L. So in this case, the condition c >a_n +1/a_n for all n is barely satisfied because as n approaches infinity, a_n approaches L, so a_n +1/a_n approaches c. Therefore, the inequality c >a_n +1/a_n holds for all n, but in the limit, it approaches equality.So, perhaps the correct approach is that for the sequence to be increasing, we need c ≥a_n +1/a_n for all n, but since in the limit it approaches c= L +1/L, then c must be greater than or equal to the maximum of a_n +1/a_n. However, since a1=1, and a_n is increasing, the maximum of a_n +1/a_n is actually achieved at the limit, so c must be at least L +1/L, but since L is determined by c, this seems circular.Alternatively, maybe we can find the range of c such that the function f(x)=c -1/x maps the interval [1,3) into itself and is increasing. To ensure that a_{n+1} =f(a_n) stays within [1,3) and is increasing.Given that the function f is increasing, and we start at a1=1. To ensure that the sequence is increasing and stays below 3, we need:1. f(x) >x for all x in [1,3). This ensures that each term is larger than the previous.2. f(x) <3 for all x in [1,3). This ensures that the next term doesn't exceed 3.So let's formalize these two conditions.First, f(x) >x ⇒c -1/x >x ⇒c >x +1/x.Second, f(x) <3 ⇒c -1/x <3 ⇒c <3 +1/x.Therefore, for all x in [1,3), c must satisfy x +1/x <c <3 +1/x.To find c such that this holds for all x in [1,3), we need c to be greater than the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3) and less than the minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3).So compute the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3) and the minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3).First, find max_{x ∈ [1,3)} x +1/x.The function g(x)=x +1/x. Its derivative is g’(x)=1 -1/x². Setting derivative to zero: 1 -1/x²=0 ⇒x=1 or x=-1. Since x ∈ [1,3), critical point at x=1. Evaluate g(x) at endpoints and critical points:At x=1: g(1)=1 +1=2.At x approaching 3 from the left: g(3)=3 +1/3≈3.333...Since the derivative g’(x)=1 -1/x². For x>1, g’(x)=1 -1/x² >0 because x²>1 ⇒1/x² <1. Therefore, g(x) is increasing on [1, ∞). Therefore, on [1,3), the maximum of g(x)=x +1/x is approached as x→3, which is 3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333...But since the interval is [1,3), the supremum is 10/3, but it's not attained. Therefore, the maximum value is approached but not reached. Therefore, to have c >x +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3), c must be at least 10/3. However, if c=10/3, then at x=3, f(x)=10/3 -1/3=9/3=3, but x=3 is not in the interval [1,3). Therefore, if c=10/3, then as x approaches 3 from below, f(x)=10/3 -1/x approaches 10/3 -1/3=9/3=3. So, for c=10/3, the function f(x) approaches 3 as x approaches 3, but since x never reaches 3, f(x) never actually reaches 3. However, if c=10/3, then the fixed point equation is L=10/3 -1/L ⇒ L +1/L=10/3. Solving this quadratic equation: 3L² -10L +3=0 ⇒ L=(10 ±√(100 -36))/6=(10 ±8)/6. So L=(10+8)/6=18/6=3, or L=(10-8)/6=2/6=1/3. So the fixed points are 3 and 1/3. Since the sequence is increasing and starts at 1, it would converge to 3. But in this case, the sequence approaches 3, but never exceeds it. However, if c=10/3, then the inequality a_{n+1}=10/3 -1/a_n. If a_n approaches 3, then a_{n+1} approaches 3, but never actually reaches or exceeds it. Therefore, technically, the inequality a_{n+1}<3 would hold for all n, but the limit is 3. So in this case, c=10/3 is the borderline case.Similarly, for the lower bound, the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3) is 10/3, so c must be greater than 10/3? Wait, no. Wait, we need c >x +1/x for all x in [1,3). Since x +1/x is increasing on [1,3), the maximum is approaching 10/3. Therefore, to satisfy c >x +1/x for all x in [1,3), c must be at least 10/3. If c=10/3, then for x approaching 3, c -1/x approaches 10/3 -1/3=3, which is the limit. So in that case, the condition c >x +1/x becomes c=10/3 >x +1/x only if x +1/x <10/3. But when x approaches 3 from below, x +1/x approaches 10/3, so c=10/3 is not strictly greater than x +1/x for all x in [1,3). Therefore, c must be greater than 10/3 to satisfy c >x +1/x for all x in [1,3). But if c >10/3, then the upper bound condition c <3 +1/x for all x in [1,3). Let's check that.For the upper bound, c <3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3). The minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3) is when x is maximum approaching 3, so 3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333..., but since x is approaching 3 from below, the infimum of 3 +1/x is 10/3. Therefore, to satisfy c <3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3), c must be less than or equal to 10/3.Wait, this is a problem. Because if c must be greater than 10/3 (from the lower bound) and less than or equal to 10/3 (from the upper bound), the only possible value is c=10/3. But as we saw earlier, c=10/3 leads to the sequence approaching 3, so a_{n+1}=10/3 -1/a_n. If we start at a1=1, let's compute a2=10/3 -1/1=10/3 -1=7/3≈2.333...a3=10/3 -1/(7/3)=10/3 -3/7≈70/21 -9/21=61/21≈2.904...a4=10/3 -1/(61/21)=10/3 -21/61≈(610 -63)/183≈547/183≈2.989...a5≈10/3 -1/(547/183)=10/3 -183/547≈(10*547 -549)/1641≈(5470 -549)/1641≈4921/1641≈2.996...So the sequence is approaching 3. Therefore, for c=10/3, the sequence is increasing and approaches 3, so a_n <a_{n+1}<3 for all n. Therefore, c=10/3 is included.But earlier analysis suggested that c must be greater than 10/3 and less than 10/3, which is impossible. But in reality, for c=10/3, the inequalities are still satisfied because even though c=10/3 equals the supremum of x +1/x, the inequality a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n >a_n holds because at each step, a_n <3, so x +1/x <10/3, so c=10/3 >x +1/x. Wait, but when x approaches 3, x +1/x approaches 10/3. So if c=10/3, then for x approaching 3, c -1/x approaches 3. So for x approaching 3 from below, c -1/x approaches 3 from below. Therefore, even though c=10/3 is equal to the supremum of x +1/x, the inequality c >x +1/x holds for all x in [1,3) because x never actually reaches 3.Therefore, c=10/3 is valid. Similarly, for the upper bound, c=10/3 must be less than 3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3). The minimum of 3 +1/x is 10/3, so c=10/3 must be less than 3 +1/x. But 10/3=3 +1/3, so for x approaching 3 from below, 3 +1/x approaches 10/3 from above. Therefore, c=10/3 <3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3) because 3 +1/x >10/3 for x ∈ [1,3). For example, when x=1, 3 +1/1=4>10/3≈3.333... When x=2, 3 +1/2=3.5>10/3. When x approaches 3, 3 +1/x approaches 10/3 from above. Therefore, c=10/3 is indeed less than 3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3). Therefore, for c=10/3, both inequalities hold: c >x +1/x and c <3 +1/x for all x ∈ [1,3).Therefore, the allowable range for c is (2,10/3]. Wait, but wait, when c=2, let's check. If c=2, then a2=2 -1/1=1, so a2=1=a1. Therefore, the sequence would be constant at 1. But the inequality a1 <a2 would not hold, since they are equal. Therefore, c must be greater than 2. Previously, when we looked at the first step, c must be greater than 2 to have a2>1. But when we considered the general case, we found that c must be at least 10/3, but in reality, c can be from just above 2 up to 10/3. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Let's resolve this.Earlier, we saw that for the first term, c >2. If c is between 2 and 10/3, does the sequence stay increasing and bounded above by 3?Let's take c=3, which is within (2,10/3≈3.333). Let's check:a1=1a2=3 -1/1=2a3=3 -1/2=2.5a4=3 -1/2.5=3 -0.4=2.6a5=3 -1/2.6≈3 -0.3846≈2.6154a6≈3 -1/2.6154≈3 -0.382≈2.618And 2.618 is approaching the golden ratio phi≈1.618... Wait, no. Wait, what's the fixed point here? For c=3, solving L=3 -1/L ⇒L +1/L=3. Multiply by L: L² -3L +1=0. Solutions L=(3 ±√5)/2≈(3 ±2.236)/2≈2.618 or 0.382. Since the sequence is increasing from 1, it would converge to≈2.618, which is less than 3. Therefore, in this case, the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 2.618<3. So for c=3, the inequality a_n <a_{n+1}<3 holds for all n. Thus, c=3 is valid.But earlier analysis suggested that c needs to be up to 10/3≈3.333. Let's check c=3.333=10/3≈3.333.As we saw earlier, with c=10/3, the sequence approaches 3. So even though c=10/3 is allowed, the sequence still satisfies a_{n+1}<3 for all n. Therefore, the allowable range for c is (2,10/3]. But let's confirm with another example. Let me take c=3.4, which is greater than 10/3≈3.333.a1=1a2=3.4 -1/1=2.4a3=3.4 -1/2.4≈3.4 -0.4167≈2.9833a4=3.4 -1/2.9833≈3.4 -0.335≈3.065Uh-oh, a4≈3.065>3. So this violates the a_{n+1}<3 condition. Therefore, c=3.4 is too big. So when c exceeds 10/3, the sequence may exceed 3. Therefore, the maximum allowable c is 10/3.Similarly, let's check c=10/3≈3.333...a1=1a2=10/3 -1=7/3≈2.333...a3=10/3 -1/(7/3)=10/3 -3/7≈70/21 -9/21=61/21≈2.904...a4=10/3 -1/(61/21)=10/3 -21/61≈(610 -63)/183=547/183≈2.989...a5≈10/3 -1/(547/183)=10/3 -183/547≈(5470 -549)/1641≈4921/1641≈2.996...a6≈10/3 -1/(4921/1641)=10/3 -1641/4921≈(10*4921 -3*1641)/(3*4921)≈(49210 -4923)/14763≈44287/14763≈3.000...So it's approaching 3 but never exceeding it. Therefore, even though a5≈2.996, a6≈3.000, but in reality, the terms approach 3 from below. Therefore, the inequality a_{n+1}<3 holds for all n when c=10/3. Hence, c can be up to 10/3.Therefore, the range of c is 2 <c ≤10/3.But we need to confirm the lower bound. When c approaches 2 from above, what happens?Take c=2.1:a1=1a2=2.1 -1=1.1a3=2.1 -1/1.1≈2.1 -0.909≈1.191a4=2.1 -1/1.191≈2.1 -0.840≈1.260a5≈2.1 -1/1.260≈2.1 -0.794≈1.306a6≈2.1 -1/1.306≈2.1 -0.766≈1.334a7≈2.1 -1/1.334≈2.1 -0.750≈1.350It's increasing, but let's see if it converges.Suppose the sequence converges to L=2.1 -1/L ⇒L +1/L=2.1.Solving L² -2.1L +1=0 ⇒L=(2.1 ±√(4.41 -4))/2=(2.1 ±√0.41)/2≈(2.1 ±0.640)/2. So L≈(2.1 +0.640)/2≈2.74/2≈1.37 or L≈(2.1 -0.640)/2≈1.46/2≈0.73. Since the sequence is increasing from 1, it would converge to≈1.37. So the sequence is increasing and bounded above by≈1.37, which is less than 3. Therefore, in this case, the inequality a_n <a_{n+1}<3 holds.Another test with c=2.5 as in part (I):a1=1a2=2.5 -1=1.5a3=2.5 -1/1.5≈2.5 -0.666≈1.833...Which converges to 2, as we saw earlier. So yes, it's increasing and bounded above by 2<3.What if c=2 exactly?a1=1a2=2 -1=1a3=2 -1/1=1, etc. So the sequence becomes constant at 1. Thus, the inequality a_n <a_{n+1} is not satisfied because they are equal. Therefore, c must be greater than 2.Therefore, putting it all together, the range of c is 2 <c ≤10/3.Therefore, part (II) answer is c ∈ (2, 10/3].But the question says \\"the range of values for c\\" that make the inequality \\"always true\\". So we need to write this interval. Since 10/3 is approximately 3.333..., which is 3 and 1/3.Therefore, in boxed form, the answer for part (I) is the general formula for b_n found earlier, which was b_n= - (4^{n-1} +2)/3, and for part (II), the range is (2, 10/3].Final Answer(I) boxed{b_n = -dfrac{4^{n-1} + 2}{3}}(II) boxed{left(2, dfrac{10}{3}right]}</think>Given a sequence ({a_n}) where (a_1 = 1) and (a_{n+1} = c - frac{1}{a_n}):(I) For (c = frac{5}{2}), find the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) where (b_n = frac{1}{a_n - 2}):1. Compute the first few terms of (a_n):   - (a_1 = 1)   - (a_2 = frac{3}{2})   - (a_3 = frac{11}{6})   - (a_4 = frac{43}{22})   - (a_5 = frac{171}{86})2.

Analyze the function (f(x) = c - frac{1}{x}) and its behavior:   - The function is increasing and must map the interval ([1, 3)) into itself.   - For (a_{n+1} > a_n), (c > x + frac{1}{x}) for all (x in [1, 3)).   - For (a_{n+1} < 3), (c < 3 + frac{1}{x}) for all (x in [1, 3)).2. Determine the bounds for (c):   - The maximum of (x + frac{1}{x}) on ([1, 3)) approaches (frac{10}{3}) as (x to 3).   - The minimum of (3 + frac{1}{x}) on ([1, 3)) is (frac{10}{3}) as (x to 3).3. Verify the critical value (c = frac{10}{3}) and ensure the sequence remains bounded and increasing.The range of values for (c) is (boxed{left(2, dfrac{10}{3}right]}).,<think>Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the sequence {a_n} where a1 is 1, and each subsequent term is defined by a_{n+1} = c - 1/a_n. There are two parts: part I asks for the general formula of another sequence {b_n} when c is 5/2, and part II asks for the range of c such that a_n < a_{n+1} < 3 always holds. Let's start with part I.First, part I: c = 5/2, and b_n = 1/(a_n - 2). They want the general formula for {b_n}. Hmm. So maybe I can find a recursive relation for b_n and solve it? Let's see.Given that a_{n+1} = 5/2 - 1/a_n. And b_n = 1/(a_n - 2). So maybe express a_{n} in terms of b_n. Let's see: if b_n = 1/(a_n - 2), then a_n = 2 + 1/b_n. Then perhaps express a_{n+1} in terms of a_n, and then in terms of b_n and b_{n+1}?Let me try that. So a_{n+1} = 5/2 - 1/a_n. Substitute a_n = 2 + 1/b_n. Then:a_{n+1} = 5/2 - 1/(2 + 1/b_n)Let me compute 1/(2 + 1/b_n). Let's write that as 1 divided by (2 + 1/b_n). Let's combine the denominator:2 + 1/b_n = (2b_n + 1)/b_n. Therefore, 1/(2 + 1/b_n) = b_n/(2b_n + 1).Therefore, a_{n+1} = 5/2 - b_n/(2b_n + 1). Let's compute that:5/2 is equal to (5(2b_n + 1))/(2(2b_n + 1)) ) minus (2b_n)/(2(2b_n + 1))? Wait, maybe just compute 5/2 - [b_n / (2b_n +1)]:Find a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and (2b_n +1). So common denominator is 2(2b_n +1). Therefore:5/2 = 5(2b_n +1)/(2(2b_n +1))And b_n/(2b_n +1) = 2b_n/(2(2b_n +1))Therefore:a_{n+1} = [5(2b_n +1) - 2b_n] / [2(2b_n +1)]Simplify the numerator:5(2b_n +1) = 10b_n +5Subtract 2b_n: 10b_n +5 -2b_n = 8b_n +5So a_{n+1} = (8b_n +5)/(2(2b_n +1))But also, since a_{n+1} = 2 + 1/b_{n+1}, right? Because b_{n+1} = 1/(a_{n+1} -2). Therefore, a_{n+1} -2 =1/b_{n+1}, so a_{n+1} =2 +1/b_{n+1}Therefore, equate the two expressions for a_{n+1}:2 +1/b_{n+1} = (8b_n +5)/(2(2b_n +1))Subtract 2 from both sides:1/b_{n+1} = (8b_n +5)/(2(2b_n +1)) -2Compute the right-hand side:(8b_n +5 - 4(2b_n +1)) / [2(2b_n +1)]Simplify numerator: 8b_n +5 -8b_n -4 = 1Therefore, 1/b_{n+1} =1 / [2(2b_n +1)]Therefore, 1/b_{n+1} =1 / (4b_n +2)Take reciprocal both sides:b_{n+1} =4b_n +2So the recursion for b_n is linear: b_{n+1} =4b_n +2. That's a linear recurrence relation. Now, we need to find the general formula for b_n. Let's see. Since this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, we can solve it using standard techniques.First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is b_{n+1} =4b_n. The solution to that is b_n^{(h)} = C*4^n, where C is a constant.Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (2), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume b_n^{(p)} = K.Plug into the recurrence:K =4K +2Solve for K: K -4K =2 => -3K=2 => K= -2/3.Therefore, the general solution is b_n = C*4^n -2/3.Now, we need to determine the constant C using the initial condition. Let's find b_1. Wait, the initial term a1 is 1. So b1 =1/(a1 -2) =1/(1 -2)= -1.Therefore, when n=1, b1 = -1. Let's plug into the general solution:b1 = C*4^1 -2/3 =4C -2/3 = -1Therefore, 4C = -1 +2/3 = (-3/3 +2/3)= -1/3 => C= (-1/3)/4= -1/12Thus, the general formula is b_n = (-1/12)*4^n -2/3. Alternatively, we can write 4^n as 4*4^{n-1}, so:b_n = (-1/12)*4^n -2/3 = (-1/12)*4*4^{n-1} -2/3 = (-1/3)*4^{n-1} -2/3. But maybe it's better to leave it as:b_n = (-1/12)*4^n -2/3. But let's check for n=1:b1 = (-1/12)*4 -2/3 = (-1/3) -2/3= -1. Correct.Alternatively, factor out -1/3:b_n = - (4^{n}/12 + 2/3) = - (4^{n}/12 + 8/12) = - (4^{n} +8)/12. But 4^{n} is 2^{2n}, so 4^{n} +8 = 4^{n} +8. So:b_n = - (4^n +8)/12 = - (4^n +8)/12. Alternatively, factor numerator:4^n +8=4*4^{n-1}+8=4(4^{n-1} +2). Hmm, but maybe not necessary. Let me check if this simplifies further.Wait, 4^n +8=4*4^{n-1} +8=4^{n} +8, but perhaps 4^n +8 can be written as 4(4^{n-1} +2). So:b_n= -4(4^{n-1} +2)/12= - (4^{n-1} +2)/3. Which is the same as earlier.So, either expression is acceptable. Let's check for n=1: - (4^{0} +2)/3= - (1 +2)/3= -1. Correct. For n=2: b2=4b1 +2=4*(-1)+2= -4 +2= -2. Using the formula: - (4^{1} +2)/3= - (4 +2)/3= -6/3= -2. Correct.Similarly, n=3: b3=4b2 +2=4*(-2)+2= -8 +2= -6. Formula: - (4^2 +2)/3= -(16 +2)/3= -18/3= -6. Correct. So the formula works.Therefore, the general formula for b_n is b_n = - (4^{n} +8)/12, or equivalently, b_n = - (4^{n-1} +2)/3. Either form is correct. Maybe the second form is simpler. So, boxed, it would be boxed{b_n = -dfrac{4^{n-1} + 2}{3}}.Now, moving on to part II: Find the range of values for c such that the inequality a_n < a_{n+1} < 3 always holds.So, for all n, a_n < a_{n+1} <3. Given that a1=1. Let's see. The problem is to find all c such that the sequence {a_n} is strictly increasing and bounded above by 3.First, let's analyze the recursive relation: a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n.We need to ensure that a_n < a_{n+1} <3 for all n. Since the sequence starts at a1=1, we need to make sure that a2= c -1/1= c -1, and that 1 <a2 <3. Similarly, a3= c -1/a2, so we need a2 < a3 <3, and so on.Therefore, for the inequality to hold for all n, the function f(x)=c -1/x must satisfy f(x) >x and f(x) <3 whenever x <3.Wait, but since a_{n+1}=f(a_n), we need f(a_n) >a_n and f(a_n) <3. So, for x in the interval (-infty, 3), f(x)=c -1/x must satisfy x < c -1/x <3.But actually, since a1=1 and the sequence is supposed to be increasing, all terms a_n will be greater than a1=1. Wait, but if the sequence is increasing and starts at 1, then all terms are at least 1. So actually, x is in [1,3). Therefore, we need that for x in [1,3), x < c -1/x <3.So, to make sure that x < c -1/x <3 for all x in [1,3). Therefore, c must be chosen such that both inequalities hold for all x in [1,3).So, first inequality: x < c -1/x. Rearranged, c >x +1/x.Second inequality: c -1/x <3. Rearranged, c <3 +1/x.Therefore, c must satisfy x +1/x < c <3 +1/x for all x in [1,3).Therefore, the lower bound for c is the maximum of x +1/x over x in [1,3), and the upper bound for c is the minimum of 3 +1/x over x in [1,3).So, to find the range of c, compute max_{x ∈ [1,3)} (x +1/x) and min_{x ∈ [1,3)} (3 +1/x). Then c must be between these two values.First, compute the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3). Let's find the critical points. Let f(x)=x +1/x. Its derivative is f’(x)=1 -1/x^2. Setting derivative to zero: 1 -1/x^2=0 => x^2=1 =>x=1 or x=-1. But in the interval [1,3), the critical point is at x=1. Now, check the endpoints and critical points.At x=1: f(1)=1 +1=2.As x approaches 3 from the left: f(3)=3 +1/3≈3.333...But since x=3 is not included, the function approaches 3 +1/3 as x approaches 3. However, we need to check if f(x)=x +1/x is increasing or decreasing on [1,3). Since the derivative f’(x)=1 -1/x^2. For x>1, 1/x^2 <1, so f’(x)=1 -1/x^2 >0. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on [1,3). Therefore, the maximum of f(x) on [1,3) is the limit as x approaches 3 from the left, which is 3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333. But since x approaches 3 but doesn't reach it, the supremum is 10/3, but the maximum is not achieved. Therefore, the maximum value of x +1/x on [1,3) is 10/3, but it's not attained. Wait, but since x can approach 3, the maximum is actually 10/3. However, for the lower bound on c, c must be greater than x +1/x for all x in [1,3). Therefore, c must be greater than the supremum of x +1/x over [1,3), which is 10/3.Similarly, compute the minimum of 3 +1/x over [1,3). The function g(x)=3 +1/x is decreasing on [1,3) because the derivative is -1/x^2 <0. Therefore, its minimum is achieved as x approaches 3 from the left, which is 3 +1/3=10/3, and its maximum is at x=1, which is 3 +1=4. Therefore, the minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3) is 10/3.Wait, but hold on. If the lower bound for c is the supremum of x +1/x, which is 10/3, and the upper bound for c is the infimum of 3 +1/x, which is also 10/3, then the only possible c is 10/3. But that would mean c=10/3 is the only value where x +1/x <c <3 +1/x for all x in [1,3). But is that the case? Let's check.If c=10/3, then for any x in [1,3):First inequality: x +1/x <10/3. Since the supremum of x +1/x is 10/3, then x +1/x <10/3 for all x in [1,3). Wait, but as x approaches 3, x +1/x approaches 10/3, so for x approaching 3, x +1/x gets arbitrarily close to 10/3. Therefore, if c=10/3, then the first inequality x +1/x <c would not hold for x approaching 3 because x +1/x approaches c. So actually, c must be greater than the supremum of x +1/x and less than the infimum of 3 +1/x. But since the supremum of x +1/x is 10/3 and the infimum of 3 +1/x is also 10/3, there is no c that satisfies both inequalities. Wait, that can't be.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine.The problem states that the inequalities a_n < a_{n+1} <3 must always hold. So starting from a1=1, the sequence must be increasing and bounded above by 3. So we need to ensure that for each term a_n in the sequence, a_{n} < a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n <3.Therefore, for each a_n, which is in [1,3), we must have:1. a_n < c -1/a_n (so c > a_n +1/a_n)2. c -1/a_n <3 (so c <3 +1/a_n)Therefore, c must be greater than a_n +1/a_n and less than 3 +1/a_n for all a_n in [1,3). But since a_n depends on c recursively, this is a bit circular. Therefore, we need to find c such that these inequalities hold for all possible a_n that the sequence can take.But perhaps instead of considering all x in [1,3), we can model this as the sequence must stay within [1,3) and be increasing. Therefore, the function f(x)=c -1/x must map [1,3) into itself and be increasing.Wait, since the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 3, if it converges, the limit L must satisfy L =c -1/L, and L<=3. Also, since the sequence is increasing, the limit L would be the supremum of the sequence. So, to ensure convergence to L<=3, we must have L=c -1/L, and L<=3.But maybe we need to ensure that the function f(x)=c -1/x is increasing (since the sequence is increasing) and that f(x) >x for x in [1,3) and f(x) <3.But let's first analyze the fixed point equation. Suppose the sequence converges to L. Then L=c -1/L. Solving for c, c= L +1/L. So the possible limit points L satisfy c= L +1/L.Moreover, since the sequence is increasing and starts at 1, if it converges, then L must be greater than 1, and since we need L <=3, then L is in (1,3]. Therefore, c= L +1/L must be in (2, 10/3] because when L=3, c=3 +1/3=10/3, and when L approaches 1 from above, c approaches 1 +1=2. So c must be in (2,10/3]. However, this is the range of c for which fixed points exist in (1,3]. But we need more than that; we need the entire sequence to stay increasing and below 3.Alternatively, maybe the function f(x)=c -1/x must be such that it's increasing (which it is, since derivative f’(x)=1/x² >0 for x>0) and that f(x) maps [1,3) into itself and f(x) >x for all x in [1,3). Because if f(x) >x and f(x) <3, then starting from x=1, the sequence will increase and stay below 3.Therefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:1. For all x in [1,3), f(x) >x: c -1/x >x ⇒ c >x +1/x2. For all x in [1,3), f(x) <3: c -1/x <3 ⇒c <3 +1/xTherefore, c must be greater than the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3) and less than the minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3).As we calculated before, the maximum of x +1/x on [1,3) is 10/3 (approached as x approaches 3), and the minimum of 3 +1/x on [1,3) is 10/3 (approached as x approaches 3). Therefore, c must be greater than 10/3 and less than 10/3, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no such c. But that contradicts the problem statement, which asks to find the range of c. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, perhaps instead of considering all x in [1,3), since the sequence is increasing, the terms a_n will approach the limit L (if it exists). Therefore, the conditions must hold not for all x in [1,3), but specifically along the sequence generated by a1=1 and a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n.Therefore, maybe I need to use induction to ensure that a_{n} <a_{n+1} <3 for all n. Let's try to find c such that:1. Base case: a1=1 <a2 <3. So, a2 =c -1/1 =c -1. Therefore, 1 <c -1 <3 ⇒ 2 <c <4.2. Inductive step: Suppose that for some n≥1, 1 <a1 <a2 <… <a_n <3. Then need to show that a_n <a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n <3.But wait, we already have a_n <a_{n+1} by the inductive hypothesis (sequence increasing). Wait, no. The inductive step would need to assume a_{n-1} <a_n <3 and then show a_n <a_{n+1} <3.But perhaps it's better to use mathematical induction formally.Base case n=1: a1=1, a2= c -1. Need 1 <c -1 <3 ⇒2 <c <4.Assume that for some k≥1, 1 <a1 <a2 <… <a_k <3. Then need to show that a_k <a_{k+1}=c -1/a_k <3.First, show a_{k+1} >a_k: c -1/a_k >a_k ⇒c >a_k +1/a_k.Second, show a_{k+1} <3: c -1/a_k <3 ⇒c <3 +1/a_k.But since the sequence is increasing, a_k ≥a1=1. Also, a_k <3. So a_k ∈ [1,3). Therefore, to ensure c >a_k +1/a_k for all a_k ∈ [1,3), and c <3 +1/a_k for all a_k ∈ [1,3).But similar to before, the maximum of a_k +1/a_k over [1,3) is 10/3, and the minimum of 3 +1/a_k over [1,3) is 10/3. Therefore, c must be greater than 10/3 and less than 10/3, which is impossible. Therefore, there is a contradiction here, implying that there is no such c. But the problem says \\"Find the range of values for c\\", so maybe the answer is that c must be in (2,10/3]?Wait, but wait. Let's re-examine. Suppose c=10/3. Then, the limit L would satisfy L=10/3 -1/L. Solving: L=10/3 -1/L. Multiply both sides by L: L²= (10/3)L -1 ⇒3L² -10L +3=0. Solving quadratic: L=(10 ±sqrt(100 -36))/6=(10 ±sqrt(64))/6=(10 ±8)/6. So L=(18)/6=3 or L=(2)/6=1/3. Since L>1, L=3. Therefore, if c=10/3, the limit is 3. But the sequence approaches 3, but never actually reaches it. So, for c=10/3, would the sequence ever exceed 3? Let's check.Take c=10/3. Then a1=1, a2=10/3 -1=7/3≈2.333. Then a3=10/3 -1/(7/3)=10/3 -3/7≈70/21 -9/21=61/21≈2.9047. Then a4=10/3 -1/(61/21)=10/3 -21/61≈(610 -63)/183=547/183≈2.989. Then a5=10/3 -183/547≈3 - (183/547 +1/3 -10/3 + ...). Wait, but the sequence is approaching 3. So, all terms a_n <3. But for c=10/3, the sequence approaches 3, so the inequality a_n <3 holds for all n. Also, since it's approaching 3, the sequence is increasing. So even though the supremum of x +1/x is 10/3, choosing c=10/3 makes the sequence approach 3, thus the inequalities a_n <a_{n+1} <3 hold for all n. Therefore, perhaps c=10/3 is allowed.But earlier analysis suggested that if c=10/3, then for x approaching 3, x +1/x approaches 10/3, so c=10/3 is equal to the supremum of x +1/x. So, in that case, the inequality x +1/x <c would not hold for x approaching 3. However, in reality, the sequence never actually reaches 3; it approaches 3. Therefore, for all terms a_n <3, we have a_n +1/a_n <10/3, so setting c=10/3, the inequality a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n =10/3 -1/a_n >a_n is equivalent to 10/3 -1/a_n >a_n ⇨ 10/3 >a_n +1/a_n. But as the sequence approaches 3, a_n +1/a_n approaches 3 +1/3=10/3. So the difference 10/3 - (a_n +1/a_n) approaches zero. Therefore, the inequality 10/3 >a_n +1/a_n holds for all a_n <3. Hence, even at the limit, since a_n never reaches 3, the inequality remains strict. Therefore, c=10/3 is acceptable.Similarly, the upper bound condition: c=10/3 <3 +1/a_n for all a_n in [1,3). 3 +1/a_n is minimized when a_n is maximized (since 1/a_n decreases as a_n increases). As a_n approaches 3, 3 +1/a_n approaches 3 +1/3=10/3. Therefore, c=10/3 is the infimum of 3 +1/a_n. Therefore, c=10/3 is the minimal upper bound. Therefore, c must be ≤10/3? But wait, if c <10/3, then the upper bound c <3 +1/a_n for all a_n in [1,3). However, if c <10/3, then for a_n approaching 3, 3 +1/a_n approaches 10/3, so c must be less than 10/3, but how does that interact with the lower bound?Wait, let's recap. The problem requires that for all n, a_n <a_{n+1} <3. Therefore, two conditions:1. a_{n+1} >a_n ⇨ c >a_n +1/a_n for all n.2. a_{n+1} <3 ⇨ c <3 +1/a_n for all n.Therefore, c must be greater than all a_n +1/a_n and less than all 3 +1/a_n.But as the sequence {a_n} increases towards the limit L (if it exists), then a_n +1/a_n approaches L +1/L. Similarly, 3 +1/a_n approaches 3 +1/L.If the sequence converges to L, then L must satisfy L =c -1/L. So c = L +1/L.Therefore, substituting back, c must equal L +1/L, and also, to ensure convergence, the function f(x)=c -1/x must be increasing (which it is) and that the sequence is bounded above by 3. So L must be <=3.Therefore, c = L +1/L, where L<=3.But also, from the recursive condition, to have a_n increasing and bounded above by 3, we need that for all x in [1, L), f(x) >x and f(x) <=L. Wait, but L is the limit, so f(L)=L. So, for x in [1, L), f(x) >x, which requires that f(x)=c -1/x >x ⇒c >x +1/x for all x in [1, L). Since L is the limit, and the function f is increasing, the minimal c that satisfies c >x +1/x for all x in [1, L) is c >=L +1/L. But c =L +1/L. Therefore, if we choose c =L +1/L, then the minimal c required is when L is as large as possible, which is L=3. Therefore, c=3 +1/3=10/3.But if we take c <10/3, say c=3, then let's see what happens. Let's take c=3. Then a1=1, a2=3 -1=2, a3=3 -1/2=2.5, a4=3 -1/2.5=3 -0.4=2.6, a5=3 -1/2.6≈3 -0.3846≈2.6154, a6≈3 -1/2.6154≈3 -0.382≈2.618, approaching the limit L where L=3 -1/L. Solving L=3 -1/L ⇒L² -3L +1=0 ⇒L=(3 ±sqrt(9 -4))/2=(3 ±sqrt(5))/2≈(3 ±2.236)/2. So positive root≈(3 +2.236)/2≈2.618, which is the golden ratio. So in this case, the sequence converges to approximately 2.618, which is less than 3. Therefore, for c=3, the inequality a_n <a_{n+1} <3 holds for all n. Therefore, c=3 is valid.But according to our previous analysis, c must be greater than the maximum of x +1/x over x in [1,3), which is 10/3≈3.333. However, c=3 works. Therefore, my previous analysis is incorrect.Where is the mistake? The mistake was assuming that c must be greater than x +1/x for all x in [1,3). But actually, the sequence {a_n} does not cover all x in [1,3); it only takes specific values depending on c. Therefore, instead of taking the maximum over all x in [1,3), we need to ensure that for the particular sequence generated by a1=1 and c, the inequalities hold at each step.Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to find c such that:1. The sequence {a_n} is increasing and bounded above by 3.To ensure that it's increasing, each term a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n must be greater than a_n. Therefore, c -1/a_n >a_n ⇒c >a_n +1/a_n.To ensure it's bounded above by 3, each term a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n <3 ⇒c <3 +1/a_n.But since the sequence is increasing, a_n ≥a1=1 for all n. Therefore, 1 ≤a1 <a2 <a3 <… <L ≤3, where L is the limit. Therefore, to ensure that these inequalities hold for all n, we need:For the lower bound on c: c must be greater than a_n +1/a_n for all n. But since the sequence is increasing, a_n +1/a_n is also increasing (since a_n increases and 1/a_n decreases, but the sum may not necessarily be increasing). Wait, need to check if a +1/a is increasing or decreasing. The function f(a)=a +1/a for a ≥1. Its derivative is f’(a)=1 -1/a². For a>1, f’(a)=1 -1/a² >0. Therefore, f(a) is increasing for a ≥1. Therefore, since a_n is increasing, a_n +1/a_n is increasing. Therefore, the maximum of a_n +1/a_n is the limit L +1/L. Therefore, c must be greater than L +1/L. But since L =c -1/L, substituting gives c= L +1/L. Therefore, c must equal L +1/L, and since L ≤3, c= L +1/L ≤3 +1/3=10/3≈3.333.But we also need c to be greater than all previous a_n +1/a_n. However, since a_n converges to L, which is the fixed point, and c=L +1/L, then the maximum of a_n +1/a_n is L +1/L, which is equal to c. Therefore, to have c >a_n +1/a_n for all n, we need c > L +1/L, but c= L +1/L. Contradiction. Therefore, the inequality c >a_n +1/a_n cannot hold for all n unless the sequence does not converge, but since the sequence is increasing and bounded above by 3, it must converge. Therefore, this suggests that the strict inequality c >a_n +1/a_n cannot hold for all n; however, in reality, for each finite n, a_n <L, so a_n +1/a_n <L +1/L=c. Therefore, c >a_n +1/a_n for all n, because a_n <L, and since a_n +1/a_n is increasing, the supremum is c. Therefore, even though a_n approaches L, for each finite n, a_n +1/a_n <c. Hence, c must be equal to the limit L +1/L, and L must be less than or equal to 3.But if L ≤3, then c= L +1/L ≤3 +1/3=10/3. However, we need L <3 to ensure that the upper bound a_{n+1}=c -1/a_n <3 holds for all n. If L=3, then c=10/3, and the sequence approaches 3. However, in that case, a_{n+1}=10/3 -1/a_n. As a_n approaches 3, 1/a_n approaches 1/3, so a_{n+1} approaches 10/3 -1/3=9/3=3. Therefore, the term a_{n+1} approaches 3, so the inequality a_{n+1} <3 would not hold in the limit, but since it's a limit, it never actually reaches 3. So for all finite n, a_{n} <3, but approaches 3. Therefore, the inequality a_{n+1} <3 holds for all n.Thus, c=10/3 is allowed. For c=10/3, the sequence approaches 3 but never exceeds it, and each term is strictly increasing. For c <10/3, the sequence converges to some L <3, and thus the inequalities hold for all n.Therefore, the range of c is (2,10/3].Wait, but the base case requires c >2. When c=2, a2=2 -1=1. Then a3=2 -1/1=1. So the sequence becomes 1,1,1,... which is not strictly increasing. Therefore, c must be greater than 2.For c in (2,10/3], the sequence is strictly increasing and bounded above by 3. Hence, the range of c is 2 <c ≤10/3.But let's verify with c=10/3. As we saw earlier, the terms approach 3 but never reach it, and each term is strictly increasing. So a_n <a_{n+1} <3 for all n. Therefore, c=10/3 is included.For c slightly less than 10/3, say c=3.3, which is less than 10/3≈3.333. Let's test:a1=1, a2=3.3 -1=2.3, a3=3.3 -1/2.3≈3.3 -0.4348≈2.8652, a4≈3.3 -1/2.8652≈3.3 -0.349≈2.951, a5≈3.3 -1/2.951≈3.3 -0.339≈2.961, a6≈3.3 -1/2.961≈3.3 -0.337≈2.963, approaching a limit L=3.3 -1/L. Solving L=3.3 -1/L ⇒L² -3.3L +1=0⇒L=(3.3 ±sqrt(10.89 -4))/2=(3.3 ±sqrt(6.89))/2≈(3.3 ±2.624)/2. Positive root≈(3.3 +2.624)/2≈5.924/2≈2.962. So the sequence converges to≈2.962 <3. Hence, a_{n+1}=3.3 -1/a_n <3.3 -1/3≈3.3 -0.333≈2.967 <3. So yes, for c=3.3 <10/3≈3.333, the sequence stays below 3.Therefore, the range is c in (2,10/3].To confirm the lower bound, when c approaches 2 from above, say c=2.1:a1=1, a2=2.1 -1=1.1, a3=2.1 -1/1.1≈2.1 -0.909≈1.191, a4≈2.1 -1/1.191≈2.1 -0.84≈1.26, a5≈2.1 -1/1.26≈2.1 -0.794≈1.306, and so on. The sequence increases and converges to a limit L=2.1 -1/L. Solving L² -2.1L +1=0⇒L=(2.1 ±sqrt(4.41 -4))/2=(2.1 ±sqrt(0.41))/2≈(2.1 ±0.640)/2. Positive root≈(2.1 +0.640)/2≈2.74/2≈1.37. So the sequence converges to≈1.37 <3, and the inequalities hold.If c=2, then a2=1, and the sequence becomes constant at 1, violating the strictly increasing condition. If c≤2, then a2= c -1 ≤1, so the sequence is not increasing. Therefore, c must be greater than 2.Thus, putting it all together, the range of c is (2,10/3].Final Answer(I) boxed{b_n = -dfrac{4^{n-1} + 2}{3}}  (II) boxed{left(2, dfrac{10}{3}right]}</think>Given a sequence ({a_n}) where (a_1 = 1) and (a_{n+1} = c - frac{1}{a_n}):(I) For (c = frac{5}{2}), we need to find the general formula for the sequence ({b_n}) where (b_n = frac{1}{a_n - 2}).1.

Let's start with part a). The equation is:а) 3/(1 - 6x) = 2/(6x + 1) - (8 + 9x)/(36x² - 1)Hmm, rational equations. I remember that to solve these, I should probably find a common denominator or multiply both sides by the least common denominator to eliminate the fractions. Let me look at the denominators first. The denominators here are (1 - 6x), (6x + 1), and (36x² - 1). Wait, 36x² - 1 looks like a difference of squares. Let me check:36x² is (6x)², and 1 is 1², so yes, 36x² - 1 factors into (6x - 1)(6x + 1). That's helpful. So the denominators are (1 - 6x), (6x + 1), and (6x - 1)(6x + 1). So, if I note that (1 - 6x) is the same as -(6x - 1). So the denominators can be rewritten as -(6x - 1), (6x + 1), and (6x - 1)(6x + 1). Therefore, the least common denominator (LCD) here would be (6x - 1)(6x + 1). But since (1 - 6x) is -(6x - 1), maybe I can adjust that. Let me see.So, if I multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD, which is (6x - 1)(6x + 1), then each denominator should cancel out. Let's proceed step by step.First, note the original equation:3/(1 - 6x) = 2/(6x + 1) - (8 + 9x)/(36x² - 1)Let me rewrite 36x² - 1 as (6x - 1)(6x + 1) to make it clearer:3/(1 - 6x) = 2/(6x + 1) - (8 + 9x)/[(6x - 1)(6x + 1)]Now, multiply each term by (6x - 1)(6x + 1):Left side: 3/(1 - 6x) * (6x - 1)(6x + 1) = 3 * (6x - 1)(6x + 1)/(1 - 6x)But notice that (6x - 1) is -(1 - 6x), so substituting that in:3 * (-(1 - 6x))(6x + 1)/(1 - 6x) = 3 * (-1)(6x + 1) = -3(6x + 1)Okay, so the left side simplifies to -3(6x + 1).Now the first term on the right side:2/(6x + 1) * (6x - 1)(6x + 1) = 2*(6x - 1)Similarly, the second term on the right side:-(8 + 9x)/[(6x - 1)(6x + 1)] * (6x - 1)(6x + 1) = -(8 + 9x)So putting it all together, the equation becomes:-3(6x + 1) = 2(6x - 1) - (8 + 9x)Now, let's expand and simplify both sides.Left side: -18x - 3Right side: 12x - 2 -8 -9x = (12x -9x) + (-2 -8) = 3x -10So now the equation is:-18x - 3 = 3x -10Let's bring all terms to one side. Let's add 18x to both sides and add 10 to both sides:-3 + 10 = 3x + 18x7 = 21xTherefore, x = 7/21 = 1/3But wait, we need to check if this is a valid solution, because sometimes when we multiply both sides by variables, we might introduce extraneous solutions. So we need to verify that x = 1/3 doesn't make any denominator zero in the original equation.Looking at the denominators: 1 - 6x, 6x + 1, and 36x² - 1.Plug x = 1/3:1 - 6*(1/3) = 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ 06*(1/3) +1 = 2 +1 = 3 ≠ 036*(1/3)² -1 = 36*(1/9) -1 = 4 -1 = 3 ≠ 0So all denominators are non-zero. Therefore, x = 1/3 is a valid solution.Let me verify by plugging x = 1/3 into the original equation:Left side: 3/(1 - 6*(1/3)) = 3/(1 - 2) = 3/(-1) = -3Right side: 2/(6*(1/3) +1) - (8 + 9*(1/3))/(36*(1/3)² -1)Compute each part:First term: 2/(2 +1) = 2/3Second term numerator: 8 + 3 = 11Denominator: 36*(1/9) -1 = 4 -1 = 3So second term: -11/3Therefore, right side: 2/3 - 11/3 = (2 -11)/3 = -9/3 = -3Left side is -3, right side is -3. So it checks out. So x = 1/3 is indeed a solution.Okay, part a) is solved. Now moving on to part b):b) 3/(1 - z²) = 2/(1 + z)² - 5/(1 - z)²Again, a rational equation. Let me analyze the denominators. The denominators are (1 - z²), (1 + z)², and (1 - z)². Note that 1 - z² is a difference of squares: (1 - z)(1 + z). So, factoring that:3/[(1 - z)(1 + z)] = 2/(1 + z)² - 5/(1 - z)²So, denominators are (1 - z)(1 + z), (1 + z)^2, and (1 - z)^2. The LCD here would be (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2. Let's confirm.Alternatively, maybe there is a lower common denominator. Let me see. The denominators are (1 - z)(1 + z), (1 + z)^2, (1 - z)^2. The LCD would need to have the highest powers of each factor. So (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2. Yes, that's the LCD.So, multiply both sides by (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2. Let's do that step by step.Original equation:3/(1 - z²) = 2/(1 + z)² - 5/(1 - z)²Multiply each term by (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2:Left side: 3/( (1 - z)(1 + z) ) * (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2 = 3*(1 - z)(1 + z)Right side first term: 2/(1 + z)^2 * (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2 = 2*(1 - z)^2Right side second term: -5/(1 - z)^2 * (1 - z)^2(1 + z)^2 = -5*(1 + z)^2Therefore, the equation becomes:3*(1 - z)(1 + z) = 2*(1 - z)^2 -5*(1 + z)^2Let's expand each term:Left side: 3*(1 - z)(1 + z) = 3*(1 - z²) = 3 - 3z²Right side:2*(1 - 2z + z²) -5*(1 + 2z + z²) = 2 -4z + 2z² -5 -10z -5z²Combine like terms:(2 -5) + (-4z -10z) + (2z² -5z²) = (-3) + (-14z) + (-3z²) = -3 -14z -3z²So the equation is:3 - 3z² = -3 -14z -3z²Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side. Let's add 3z² to both sides and add 3 to both sides:3 +3 = -14z6 = -14zTherefore, z = -6/14 = -3/7Simplify: z = -3/7Now, need to check if this solution is valid, meaning it doesn't make any denominator zero in the original equation.Original denominators: 1 - z², (1 + z)^2, (1 - z)^2Plug z = -3/7:1 - (-3/7)^2 = 1 - 9/49 = 40/49 ≠ 0(1 + (-3/7))² = (4/7)^2 = 16/49 ≠ 0(1 - (-3/7))² = (10/7)^2 = 100/49 ≠ 0All denominators are non-zero, so z = -3/7 is valid.Let me verify by plugging z = -3/7 into the original equation:Left side: 3/(1 - z²) = 3/(1 - (9/49)) = 3/(40/49) = 3*(49/40) = 147/40Right side: 2/(1 + z)^2 -5/(1 - z)^2Compute each term:First term: 2/(1 + (-3/7))² = 2/(4/7)^2 = 2/(16/49) = 2*(49/16) = 49/8Second term: -5/(1 - (-3/7))² = -5/(10/7)^2 = -5/(100/49) = -5*(49/100) = -245/100 = -49/20So right side: 49/8 -49/20. Let's get common denominator 40:49/8 = 245/40, 49/20 = 98/40So 245/40 -98/40 = 147/40Left side is 147/40, right side is 147/40. It checks out.

The denominators can't be zero, so let's see:For the first denominator, 1 - 6x ≠ 0 => x ≠ 1/6.Second denominator, 6x + 1 ≠ 0 => x ≠ -1/6.Third denominator, 36x² - 1. Let's factor that: it's a difference of squares, so (6x - 1)(6x + 1). So this denominator is zero when x = 1/6 or x = -1/6. So overall, x cannot be 1/6 or -1/6. Got that. So when we solve, we have to make sure the solutions aren't these excluded values.Now, to solve the equation, maybe we can find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 - 6x), (6x + 1), and (36x² - 1). Wait, 36x² - 1 is actually (6x - 1)(6x + 1), which is the same as -(1 - 6x)(6x + 1). Let me check: (6x - 1)(6x + 1) = 36x² - 1. Yes. So 36x² -1 is (6x -1)(6x +1). Therefore, the common denominator would be (6x -1)(6x +1), which is 36x² -1. Alternatively, since 1 -6x is -(6x -1), so maybe we can write all denominators in terms of (6x -1) and (6x +1). Let's see. First term: 3/(1 -6x) can be written as 3/-(6x -1) = -3/(6x -1). Second term: 2/(6x +1) is okay. Third term: (8 +9x)/(36x² -1) is (8 +9x)/[(6x -1)(6x +1)].So rewriting the equation:-3/(6x -1) = 2/(6x +1) - (8 +9x)/[(6x -1)(6x +1)]Now, multiply both sides by the common denominator (6x -1)(6x +1) to eliminate denominators. Left side: -3/(6x -1) * (6x -1)(6x +1) = -3*(6x +1)Right side: [2/(6x +1) - (8 +9x)/[(6x -1)(6x +1)]] * (6x -1)(6x +1) = 2*(6x -1) - (8 +9x)So now the equation is:-3*(6x +1) = 2*(6x -1) - (8 +9x)Let me compute each side:Left side: -18x -3Right side: 12x -2 -8 -9x = (12x -9x) + (-2 -8) = 3x -10So equation becomes:-18x -3 = 3x -10Now, let's solve for x.Bring all terms to left side:-18x -3 -3x +10 = 0 => -21x +7 = 0 => -21x = -7 => x = (-7)/(-21) = 1/3So x = 1/3. Now check if this is allowed. The restricted values were x ≠ 1/6 and x ≠ -1/6. 1/3 is not equal to those, so that's okay.But let's verify the solution by plugging back into original equation.Original equation: 3/(1 -6x) = 2/(6x +1) - (8 +9x)/(36x² -1)Plug x =1/3:Left side: 3/(1 -6*(1/3)) = 3/(1 -2) = 3/(-1) = -3Right side: 2/(6*(1/3)+1) - (8 +9*(1/3))/(36*(1/3)^2 -1)Compute each term:First term: 2/(2 +1) = 2/3Second term numerator: 8 +3 =11Denominator: 36*(1/9) -1 =4 -1=3So second term is 11/3Therefore, right side: 2/3 -11/3 = (2 -11)/3 = -9/3 = -3Left side was -3, right side is -3. So it checks out. So x =1/3 is a valid solution.Okay, part a) is solved. Now part b).Equation: 3/(1 - z²) = 2/(1 + z)² -5/(1 - z)²Again, first note the restrictions. Denominators can't be zero. So:1 - z² ≠0 => z ≠1 or -1(1 + z)^2 ≠0 => z ≠ -1(1 - z)^2 ≠0 => z ≠1Therefore, z cannot be 1 or -1.So need to solve 3/(1 - z²) = 2/(1 + z)^2 -5/(1 - z)^2Note that 1 - z² factors as (1 - z)(1 + z). Let's see if we can express all terms in terms of (1 - z) and (1 + z). Let's write 1 - z² as (1 - z)(1 + z). Left side: 3/[(1 - z)(1 + z)]Right side: 2/(1 + z)^2 -5/(1 - z)^2Let me get a common denominator for the right side. The denominators are (1 + z)^2 and (1 - z)^2. The common denominator would be (1 + z)^2(1 - z)^2. Alternatively, since 1 - z² is (1 - z)(1 + z), maybe we can use a different common denominator.Alternatively, let's set variables to simplify. Let me let a = 1 + z and b =1 - z. Then the equation becomes:3/(b*a) = 2/a² -5/b²But maybe that complicates. Alternatively, multiply both sides by (1 - z²)(1 + z)^2(1 - z)^2 to eliminate denominators. But that might be too much. Alternatively, cross-multiplied step by step.Alternatively, multiply both sides by (1 - z²), which is (1 - z)(1 + z), to eliminate the left denominator.So:3 = [2/(1 + z)^2 -5/(1 - z)^2]*(1 - z)(1 + z)Let's compute the right side:First term: [2/(1 + z)^2]*(1 - z)(1 + z) = 2*(1 - z)/(1 + z)Second term: [-5/(1 - z)^2]*(1 - z)(1 + z) = -5*(1 + z)/(1 - z)So equation becomes:3 = [2*(1 - z)/(1 + z)] - [5*(1 + z)/(1 - z)]So 3 = [2(1 - z)/(1 + z) -5(1 + z)/(1 - z)]To simplify this, perhaps find a common denominator for the two terms on the right. The denominators are (1 + z) and (1 - z), so common denominator is (1 + z)(1 - z). Let's rewrite each term:First term: 2(1 - z)/(1 + z) = 2(1 - z)^2 / [(1 + z)(1 - z)]Wait, to get denominator (1 + z)(1 - z), we multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - z):2(1 - z)/(1 + z) = 2(1 - z)*(1 - z)/[(1 + z)(1 - z)] = 2(1 - z)^2 / (1 - z²)Similarly, second term: -5(1 + z)/(1 - z) = -5(1 + z)^2 / [(1 - z)(1 + z)] = -5(1 + z)^2 / (1 - z²)So combining both terms:[2(1 - z)^2 -5(1 + z)^2]/(1 - z²) = 3Multiply both sides by (1 - z²):2(1 - z)^2 -5(1 + z)^2 = 3(1 - z²)Now expand all terms:Left side:2(1 - 2z + z²) -5(1 + 2z + z²)= 2 -4z +2z² -5 -10z -5z²= (2 -5) + (-4z -10z) + (2z² -5z²)= -3 -14z -3z²Right side:3(1 - z²) =3 -3z²So equation becomes:-3 -14z -3z² =3 -3z²Let's bring all terms to left side:-3 -14z -3z² -3 +3z² =0Simplify:(-3 -3) + (-14z) + (-3z² +3z²) = -6 -14z =0So -6 -14z =0 => -14z=6 => z=6/(-14)= -3/7So z= -3/7. Now check if this is allowed. The restricted values are z ≠1 and z≠-1. -3/7 is not equal to those, so okay.But let's verify the solution in original equation.Original equation: 3/(1 - z²) =2/(1 + z)^2 -5/(1 - z)^2Plug z= -3/7:Left side: 3/(1 - (-3/7)^2) =3/(1 -9/49)=3/(40/49)=3*(49/40)=147/40Right side: 2/(1 + (-3/7))² -5/(1 - (-3/7))² =2/(4/7)^2 -5/(10/7)^2Compute each term:First term: 2/(16/49)=2*(49/16)=98/16=49/8Second term: -5/(100/49)= -5*(49/100)= -245/100= -49/20So right side: 49/8 -49/20. Let's compute:Convert to common denominator 40.49/8 =245/4049/20=98/40245/40 -98/40=147/40Left side was 147/40, right side is 147/40. Checks out. So z= -3/7 is valid.Therefore, both equations are solved. The roots are x=1/3 and z= -3/7.Final Answera) boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}  b) boxed{-dfrac{3}{7}}</think>To solve the given equations, we start with part a):а) (frac{3}{1-6x} = frac{2}{6x+1} - frac{8+9x}{36x^2 -1})1.

I need to figure out which pair of functions represent the same function. There are four options: A, B, C, D. Each option has two functions, f and g, and I have to check if they are the same. Hmm, to determine if two functions are the same, they need to have the same domain, codomain, and the same rule that assigns each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain. So even if the rules look similar, if their domains are different, they aren't the same function. Alright, let's go through each option one by one.Starting with option A: f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x² - 1)/(x - 1). Let me write them down. f(x) is straightforward; it's a linear function with slope 1 and y-intercept 1. Its domain is all real numbers because there's no restriction. Now g(x) is a rational function. Let's see, the numerator is x squared minus 1, which factors into (x - 1)(x + 1). The denominator is x - 1. So, we can simplify g(x) as (x - 1)(x + 1)/(x - 1). But wait, here we have a cancellation. If x ≠ 1, then we can cancel out (x - 1) from numerator and denominator, leaving us with x + 1. However, at x = 1, the original function g(x) is undefined because the denominator becomes zero. Therefore, even though g(x) simplifies to x + 1, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers except x = 1, whereas the domain of f(x) is all real numbers. Since the domains are different, these two functions are not the same. So option A is not a correct pair.Moving on to option B: f(x) = 1 and g(x) = x⁰. Let's analyze. The function f(x) is a constant function equal to 1 for all x. Its domain is all real numbers. For g(x), x raised to the power of 0 is generally 1 for any x ≠ 0, but what about when x = 0? Hmm, 0⁰ is undefined or indeterminate in mathematics. Wait, but sometimes in certain contexts, people might define 0⁰ as 1 for convenience, like in combinatorics or power series. However, in the realm of real analysis, 0⁰ is considered undefined. So, if we consider the domain of g(x) = x⁰, it should be all real numbers except x = 0, because at x = 0, it's undefined. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is x ≠ 0, while the domain of f(x) is all real numbers. Thus, they have different domains, so they are not the same function. Wait, but hold on. Maybe in some cases, especially in algebra, x⁰ is defined as 1 for all x, including x = 0. I need to check that. Wait, no, typically, 0⁰ is undefined. For example, the function x⁰ is 1 only when x ≠ 0. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the domain of g(x) would exclude x = 0. Therefore, f and g in option B have different domains, so they are not the same function. Therefore, option B is not correct either.Wait, but maybe in the problem's context, they are assuming that x⁰ is defined as 1 even at x = 0. Hmm. The question is about whether they represent the same function. If the problem's answer key considers x⁰ as 1 for all x, including x=0, then they would be the same. But in standard mathematics, 0⁰ is undefined. So, unless specified, it's safer to assume that 0⁰ is undefined. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is x ≠ 0. Therefore, f and g have different domains, so they are different functions. Therefore, B is incorrect. Hmm. So maybe the answer isn't B. Let me think again. Wait, if we consider that in some contexts, like polynomial functions, the constant function 1 is equivalent to x⁰, but in that case, it's a matter of interpretation. However, as functions from real numbers to real numbers, x⁰ is not defined at 0, so they are different. So, I think B is not correct.Moving on to option C: f(x) = √(x²) and g(x) = (√x)². Let's check these. First, f(x) is the square root of x squared. The square root of a square is the absolute value of x. So, f(x) = |x|. The domain of this function is all real numbers because x² is always non-negative, and the square root is defined for all non-negative numbers. So, f(x) is |x| with domain all real numbers. Now, g(x) is (√x) squared. Let's see. The square of the square root of x. The square and the square root are inverse operations, but we have to consider the domain here. The square root of x, √x, is only defined for x ≥ 0. So, the domain of g(x) is x ≥ 0. Then, (√x)² would be x, but only for x ≥ 0. Therefore, g(x) = x for x ≥ 0. However, f(x) is |x|, which is x for x ≥ 0 and -x for x < 0. Therefore, even though for x ≥ 0, f(x) and g(x) both equal x, but f(x) is defined for all real numbers, whereas g(x) is only defined for x ≥ 0. Therefore, the domains are different. So, the functions f and g in option C have different domains and different rules (since f(x) is |x|, which equals x only when x is non-negative, but also equals -x when x is negative, whereas g(x) is only defined for non-negative x and equals x there). Therefore, they are not the same function. So option C is incorrect.Finally, option D: f(x) is defined piecewise. It's x when x ≥ 0, and -x when x < 0. So, let's parse that. If x is greater than or equal to 0, f(x) = x; if x is less than 0, f(x) = -x. Wait, that's the definition of the absolute value function. Because |x| is x when x ≥ 0 and -x when x < 0. So, f(x) is |x|. Then, g(t) = |t|. So, regardless of the variable name, t or x, the functions are both absolute value functions. The domain of f(x) is all real numbers, as given by the piecewise definition, and the domain of g(t) is all real numbers as well. The codomain is also the same (assuming both map real numbers to non-negative real numbers). Since the variable name doesn't affect the function's definition, f and g are the same function. Therefore, option D is correct.But wait, let me double-check. For f(x), when x ≥ 0, f(x) = x, which is the same as |x|. When x < 0, f(x) = -x, which is also |x|. So f(x) is indeed |x|. And g(t) is |t|. Since functions are defined by their domains, codomains, and rules, and here both have the same domain (all real numbers), same codomain (non-negative real numbers), and same rule (absolute value), even though the variable names are different (x vs. t), they are considered the same function. Changing the variable name doesn't create a different function. So yes, D is correct.Therefore, among the options, D is the correct pair representing the same function.Final Answerboxed{D}</think>To determine which pairs of functions represent the same function, we need to check if they have the same domain, codomain, and rule.Option A:  - ( f(x) = x + 1 ) has a domain of all real numbers.  - ( g(x) = frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} ) simplifies to ( x + 1 ) but is undefined at ( x = 1 ).  - Different domains, so not the same function.Option B:  - ( f(x) = 1 ) is a constant function with domain all real numbers.  - ( g(x) = x^0 ) is 1 for ( x neq 0 ), but undefined at ( x = 0 ).  - Different domains, so not the same function.Option C:  - ( f(x) = sqrt{x^2} ) simplifies to ( |x| ) with domain all real numbers.  - ( g(x) = (sqrt{x})^2 ) simplifies to ( x ) but is only defined for ( x geq 0 ).  - Different domains and rules, so not the same function.Option D:  - ( f(x) ) is defined piecewise as ( x ) for ( x geq 0 ) and ( -x ) for ( x < 0 ), which is the absolute value function ( |x| ).  - ( g(t) = |t| ) is the absolute value function.  - Both have the same domain (all real numbers), codomain, and rule, so they are the same function.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{D}).,<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which pair of functions represent the same function. There are four options: A, B, C, D. Hmm. Let me go through each one step by step.Starting with option A: f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = (x² - 1)/(x - 1). Let me recall that two functions are the same if they have the same domain, codomain, and the same output for each input in the domain. So first, what's the domain of f(x)? It's a linear function, so the domain is all real numbers. For g(x), it's a rational function, so the denominator can't be zero. The denominator is x - 1, so x cannot be 1. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers except x = 1. Since f(x) and g(x) have different domains, they can't be the same function. But wait, maybe they simplify to the same expression? Let's check. If I factor the numerator of g(x), it's x² - 1, which factors into (x - 1)(x + 1). So g(x) = [(x - 1)(x + 1)]/(x - 1). Then, as long as x ≠ 1, we can cancel out the (x - 1) terms, leaving x + 1. So g(x) simplifies to x + 1, but only when x ≠ 1. Therefore, even though the expressions are the same for x ≠ 1, the domains are different because f(x) is defined at x = 1 while g(x) is not. Therefore, A is not a pair of the same function. So I can eliminate option A.Moving on to option B: f(x) = 1 and g(x) = x⁰. Let's see. The function f(x) = 1 is a constant function, defined for all real numbers x. For g(x) = x⁰, I know that any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. However, what about x = 0? 0⁰ is undefined, right? So the domain of g(x) is all real numbers except x = 0. Therefore, similar to option A, even though g(x) equals 1 for all x ≠ 0, the domain of g(x) excludes x = 0, while f(x) is defined everywhere. So their domains are different. Therefore, B is also not the same function. Wait, but I need to verify. Is 0⁰ considered here? In some contexts, 0⁰ is defined as 1, but in many mathematical contexts, it's undefined or indeterminate. So unless specified otherwise, I think g(x) would have domain x ≠ 0. Therefore, f and g have different domains. So B is not correct either. Hmm, maybe someone could argue that x⁰ is defined as 1 even at 0, but I don't think that's standard. Usually, 0⁰ is undefined. So I think B is not a match.Option C: f(x) = √(x²) and g(x) = (√x)². Let's check these. Starting with f(x) = √(x²). The square root of x squared is the absolute value of x, right? Because √(x²) = |x|. So f(x) is |x|, which is defined for all real numbers x. The domain is all real numbers. Now g(x) = (√x)². Let's see. The square of the square root of x. First, the square root of x, √x, is only defined for x ≥ 0. So the domain of √x is x ≥ 0. Then, squaring that result would give back x, but only for x ≥ 0. So (√x)² = x for x ≥ 0. However, the domain here is still x ≥ 0, because the inner function √x requires x to be non-negative. Therefore, while f(x) = |x| has domain all real numbers, g(x) = (√x)² has domain x ≥ 0, and for those x, they both equal x. But since their domains are different, they are not the same function. For example, f(-1) = |-1| = 1, but g(-1) is undefined. Therefore, C is not a pair of the same function either.Now option D: f(x) is defined piecewise. Let me parse that. It says f(x) = x when x ≥ 0, and f(x) = -x when x < 0. So that's equivalent to f(x) = |x|. Because if x is non-negative, it's x, and if x is negative, it's -x, which is the definition of absolute value. Then g(t) = |t|. So f(x) and g(t) are both absolute value functions. However, the variables are different: one is x and the other is t. But in mathematics, the variable name doesn't matter; it's the rule and domain that count. So as long as both functions have the same domain and codomain, which they do—both are defined for all real numbers (since absolute value is defined everywhere) and output real numbers—they are the same function. Even though one uses x and the other uses t, that's just a notational difference. Therefore, D is the correct pair.Wait, let me double-check. For D, f(x) is defined as x when x ≥ 0 and -x when x < 0. Yes, that's exactly |x|. And g(t) is |t|, so regardless of the variable name, they are the same function. Therefore, D is the correct answer.So recapping:A: Different domains (g excludes x=1) → differentB: Different domains (g excludes x=0) → differentC: Different domains (g requires x ≥0) → differentD: Same domain and same rule, just different variable names → same functionTherefore, the answer should be D.Final Answerboxed{D}</think>To determine which pairs of functions represent the same function, we need to check if they have the same domain, codomain, and output for each input.Option A: ( f(x) = x + 1 ) and ( g(x) = frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} )- The domain of ( f(x) ) is all real numbers.- The domain of ( g(x) ) excludes ( x = 1 ).- Although ( g(x) ) simplifies to ( x + 1 ) for ( x neq 1 ), the domains differ.

The variable names ( x ) and ( t ) do not affect the function's identity.

I need to simplify this expression: (x + 1 - 3/(x - 1)) divided by ( (x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1) ). Then evaluate it by substituting a number from 1, 2, 3. Hmm, first, I need to simplify the complex fraction here.Starting with the numerator of the main expression: x + 1 - 3/(x - 1). Let me combine those terms into a single fraction. The common denominator here would be (x - 1). So, I can rewrite x + 1 as (x + 1)(x - 1)/(x - 1) to get the same denominator as the -3/(x - 1) term. Let me check that.Wait, actually, x + 1 is two terms. To combine them with the third term, which is a fraction, I need to express x + 1 as a fraction over 1, then combine with 3/(x - 1). Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire numerator as:[ (x + 1)(x - 1) - 3 ] / (x - 1)Wait, that might work. Let's see:The numerator is x + 1 - 3/(x - 1). To combine them, the common denominator is (x - 1). So:First term: (x + 1) can be thought of as (x + 1) * (x - 1)/(x - 1). Then subtract 3/(x - 1). So:[ (x + 1)(x - 1) - 3 ] / (x - 1)Yes, that's right. Let's compute (x + 1)(x - 1). That's x² - 1, from the difference of squares. So then:x² - 1 - 3 = x² - 4Therefore, the numerator simplifies to (x² - 4)/(x - 1)Now, the denominator of the main expression is (x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1). Let me note that x² - 4x + 4 is a quadratic. Let's factor that: it's (x - 2)², right? Because (x - 2)^2 = x² -4x +4. So the denominator becomes (x - 2)²/(x - 1)So now the entire expression is:Numerator: (x² -4)/(x -1) divided by Denominator: (x - 2)²/(x -1)Dividing two fractions is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal, so:[(x² -4)/(x -1)] * [(x -1)/(x - 2)²]Here, the (x -1) terms cancel out. So we are left with (x² -4)/(x - 2)²Now, x² -4 is another difference of squares: (x - 2)(x + 2). So substituting that in:[(x - 2)(x + 2)] / (x - 2)²Then, we can cancel one (x - 2) term from numerator and denominator:(x + 2)/(x - 2)So the simplified expression is (x + 2)/(x - 2)Alright, that's simplified. Now, the next step is to substitute a suitable number from 1, 2, 3. But I need to check which of these numbers are allowed in the original expression. Let me think about the original expression's domain.In the original expression, the denominators are (x - 1) and (x - 2)². So x cannot be 1 or 2, because those would make the denominators zero. Therefore, substituting x =1 or x=2 is invalid. But the problem says to choose from 1, 2, 3, so the only valid choice is 3. Therefore, substitute x=3 into the simplified expression (x + 2)/(x - 2).Plugging in x=3: (3 +2)/(3 -2) = 5/1 =5. So the answer is 5.Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if the substitution is allowed in the original expression. Original expression had denominators (x -1) and (x - 2)^2. For x=3, (3-1)=2 and (3-2)=1, so denominators are 2 and 1, which are non-zero. So x=3 is valid.Alternatively, if they had substituted into the original expression, would they get the same result? Let me verify that.Original expression: (x + 1 - 3/(x -1)) ÷ [(x² -4x +4)/(x -1)]Substituting x=3:First compute numerator: 3 + 1 - 3/(3 -1) = 4 - 3/2 = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 or 5/2.Denominator: (9 -12 +4)/(3 -1) = (1)/2.So the entire expression is (5/2) ÷ (1/2) = (5/2)*(2/1) = 5, which matches the simplified expression's result. So that checks out.Therefore, the correct answer is 5, which is obtained by substituting x=3. So the suitable number is 3, and the evaluated result is 5.Final Answerboxed{5}</think>To simplify the given expression ((x + 1 - frac{3}{x - 1}) div frac{x^2 - 4x + 4}{x - 1}), we start by combining the terms in the numerator:1. Combine (x + 1 - frac{3}{x - 1}) over a common denominator ((x - 1)):   [   frac{(x + 1)(x - 1) - 3}{x - 1} = frac{x^2 - 1 - 3}{x - 1} = frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 1}   ]2.

The values (x = 1) and (x = 2) are excluded because they make the original denominators zero. Substituting (x = 3) into the simplified expression (frac{x + 2}{x - 2}):[frac{3 + 2}{3 - 2} = frac{5}{1} = 5]Verification by substituting (x = 3) into the original expression confirms the result. Therefore, the evaluated result is:[boxed{5}],<think>Okay, let's see. I need to simplify this expression first: (x + 1 - 3/(x - 1)) divided by (x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1). Then after simplifying, I have to choose a number from 1, 2, or 3 to substitute and evaluate. Alright, let's start step by step.First, let's focus on simplifying the numerator of the main fraction, which is (x + 1 - 3/(x - 1)). The denominator of the main fraction is (x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1), so the whole expression is that numerator divided by that denominator.Hmm, maybe I should rewrite the numerator as a single fraction. The numerator has x, 1, and -3/(x - 1). To combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The terms x and 1 can be thought of as (x)/1 and 1/1. So the common denominator would be (x - 1). Let me convert each term to have denominator (x - 1).So, x can be written as x*(x - 1)/(x - 1). Similarly, 1 can be written as 1*(x - 1)/(x - 1). Then the third term is already -3/(x - 1). Let's compute each part:x becomes [x(x - 1)] / (x - 1)1 becomes [1*(x - 1)] / (x - 1)-3/(x - 1) stays as it is.So combining these:[x(x - 1) + (x - 1) - 3] / (x - 1)Let me compute the numerator here:First term: x(x - 1) = x² - xSecond term: (x - 1)Third term: -3So adding all together:x² - x + x - 1 - 3Wait, let's see:x² - x (from first term) + x (from second term) -1 (from second term) -3 (third term)So combining like terms:The -x and +x cancel each other out: x² -x + x = x²Then -1 -3 = -4So the numerator becomes x² - 4Therefore, the entire numerator of the main expression is (x² - 4)/(x - 1)Wait, hold on. Let me verify that again.Original numerator after combining:x(x - 1) + (x - 1) - 3= x² - x + x -1 -3= x² + 0x -4= x² -4Yes, that's correct. So the numerator simplifies to (x² - 4)/(x - 1)So the main expression becomes [(x² - 4)/(x - 1)] divided by [(x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1)]Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:[(x² - 4)/(x - 1)] * [(x - 1)/(x² - 4x + 4)]Notice that (x - 1) cancels out from the numerator of the second fraction and the denominator of the first fraction. So:(x² - 4)/1 * 1/(x² - 4x + 4)So now we have (x² - 4)/(x² - 4x + 4)Now, let's factor both numerator and denominator.Numerator: x² - 4 is a difference of squares, so factors into (x - 2)(x + 2)Denominator: x² - 4x + 4. Let's see, this is a quadratic. Let's check if it's a perfect square. The coefficient of x is -4, half of that is -2, squared is 4. So yes, (x - 2)².So denominator factors to (x - 2)²Therefore, the expression simplifies to [(x - 2)(x + 2)] / [(x - 2)²]We can cancel one (x - 2) from numerator and denominator, giving (x + 2)/(x - 2)So the simplified expression is (x + 2)/(x - 2)Now, the problem says to evaluate this simplified expression by substituting a suitable number from 1, 2, 3.But wait, we have to consider the original expression's domain. Because in the original expression, there were denominators x - 1 and then x² - 4x + 4 over x - 1, so we need to check for values that would make any denominator zero.Original denominators: x - 1 cannot be zero, so x ≠ 1. Then the denominator of the second fraction is (x² - 4x + 4)/(x - 1). The denominator here is x - 1, which is already excluded. Also, the numerator x² - 4x + 4 is (x - 2)^2, which is not zero unless x = 2. So x = 2 would make the denominator of the second fraction zero? Wait, no. Wait, the original division is numerator divided by denominator. The denominator of the entire expression is (x² - 4x +4)/(x - 1). So if the denominator is (x² -4x +4)/(x -1), then if x² -4x +4 is zero, but since it's in the denominator, even though x² -4x +4 is (x - 2)^2, which is zero when x = 2. Therefore, x = 2 is excluded because it would make the denominator zero. So x cannot be 1 or 2.Therefore, in the original expression, x ≠ 1 and x ≠ 2.But after simplification, the expression is (x + 2)/(x - 2). Here, x ≠ 2. So even though x =1 was excluded in the original problem, in the simplified expression, x =1 is allowed? Wait, but in the simplified expression, x=1 would give (1 +2)/(1 -2) = 3/-1 = -3, but in the original expression, x=1 is excluded. So even though after simplification, x=1 is allowed, we still have to exclude it because of the original expression's domain. So x cannot be 1 or 2.Therefore, when choosing a suitable number from 1, 2, 3, we have to exclude 1 and 2. So the only number left is 3. So substitute x=3.But let me verify again. Original expression: (x +1 - 3/(x-1)) divided by [(x² -4x +4)/(x -1)]So x ≠1 (because denominator x -1 in the first part) and x ≠2 (because denominator becomes zero when x=2 in the second part). So x=1 and x=2 are excluded. Therefore, from 1, 2, 3, only x=3 is allowed.Therefore, substitute x=3 into the simplified expression (x + 2)/(x -2):(3 + 2)/(3 -2) = 5/1 = 5Therefore, the evaluated result is 5.So the answer is 5, and we substitute x=3.Wait, but let me check the original expression and the simplified expression with x=3 to make sure they are the same. Sometimes simplifications can have discrepancies if there are errors.Original expression:Numerator: 3 +1 - 3/(3 -1) = 4 - 3/2 = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5Denominator: (3² -4*3 +4)/(3 -1) = (9 -12 +4)/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5So original expression: 2.5 / 0.5 = 5Simplified expression: (3 + 2)/(3 -2) = 5/1 = 5Yes, matches. So that's correct.So even though the problem says \\"choose a suitable number from 1, 2, 3\\", but 1 and 2 are excluded, so 3 is the only choice, and substituting gives 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.Final AnswerThe evaluated result is boxed{5}.</think>To simplify the expression ((x + 1 - frac{3}{x - 1}) div frac{x^2 - 4x + 4}{x - 1}):1.

The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one. Let me start by recalling some properties of complex numbers and conjugates. First, complex numbers have a real part and an imaginary part, usually written as a + bi. The conjugate of a complex number, denoted as (bar{z}), changes the sign of the imaginary part. So if z is a + bi, then (bar{z}) is a - bi. That seems straightforward.The equation given is (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5. Hmm. Maybe I can solve for z first and then take its conjugate. Let me try that approach.Let me denote z as a complex number. Let's let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, z - 3 would be (x - 3) + yi. Multiplying that by (2 - i) should equal 5. Let's compute that multiplication step by step.First, multiply (z - 3) by (2 - i):(z - 3)(2 - i) = [(x - 3) + yi](2 - i)To multiply these two complex numbers, I can use the distributive property (FOIL):= (x - 3)(2) + (x - 3)(-i) + yi(2) + yi(-i)Let me compute each term separately:First term: (x - 3)(2) = 2x - 6Second term: (x - 3)(-i) = -i(x - 3) = -ix + 3iThird term: yi(2) = 2yiFourth term: yi(-i) = -y i^2. But since i^2 = -1, this becomes -y(-1) = ySo putting all the terms together:2x - 6 - ix + 3i + 2yi + yNow, combine like terms. The real parts are 2x - 6 + y. The imaginary parts are (-x + 3 + 2y)i.So the entire expression is:(2x - 6 + y) + (-x + 3 + 2y)iThis is equal to 5. But 5 is a real number, so the imaginary part must be zero, and the real part must be 5.Therefore, we can set up two equations:1. Real part: 2x - 6 + y = 52. Imaginary part: (-x + 3 + 2y) = 0So now we have a system of two equations:Equation 1: 2x + y = 5 + 6 → 2x + y = 11Equation 2: -x + 2y = -3 → (-x + 2y) = -3Let me write them clearly:1. 2x + y = 112. -x + 2y = -3I need to solve this system for x and y.Let me use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Multiply equation 2 by 2 so that the coefficients of x are opposites:Equation 2 multiplied by 2: -2x + 4y = -6Now add this to equation 1:(2x + y) + (-2x + 4y) = 11 + (-6)Simplify:(0x + 5y) = 5So 5y = 5 → y = 1Now substitute y = 1 into equation 1:2x + 1 = 11 → 2x = 10 → x = 5So x = 5 and y = 1. Therefore, z = x + yi = 5 + i.But the question asks for the conjugate of z, which is (bar{z}). Since z = 5 + i, then (bar{z}) = 5 - i. Let me check the options:Options:A: 2 + iB: 2 - iC: 5 + iD: 5 - iSo the answer should be D: 5 - i.Wait, but let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's substitute z = 5 + i back into the original equation to check.Compute (z - 3)(2 - i):z - 3 = (5 + i) - 3 = 2 + iMultiply by (2 - i):(2 + i)(2 - i) = 2*2 + 2*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 4 - 2i + 2i - i^2Simplify:4 - 2i + 2i - (-1) = 4 + 0i + 1 = 5Yes, that works. So the original equation holds when z = 5 + i, which means the conjugate is 5 - i, which is option D. So the answer is D.But just to make sure, let me try an alternative approach. Maybe working directly with conjugates. Since we need (bar{z}), maybe we can manipulate the original equation using conjugate properties.Given that (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5. If I take the conjugate of both sides, the left side becomes (overline{(z - 3)(2 - i)}) and the right side becomes (overline{5}). Since 5 is real, its conjugate is itself. So:(overline{(z - 3)(2 - i)} = 5)Using the property that the conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates:(overline{z - 3} cdot overline{2 - i} = 5)Which is:((bar{z} - 3)(2 + i) = 5)So we have:((bar{z} - 3)(2 + i) = 5)So if I let (bar{z} = w), then:(w - 3)(2 + i) = 5So solving for w:w - 3 = 5 / (2 + i)Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - i):w - 3 = 5(2 - i) / [(2 + i)(2 - i)] = 5(2 - i)/(4 + 1) = 5(2 - i)/5 = 2 - iTherefore, w - 3 = 2 - i → w = 2 - i + 3 = 5 - iThus, (bar{z}) = 5 - i, which is option D.

I need to find the conjugate of the complex number z, given that (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5. The options are A through D. Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let me take it step by step.First, let's recall that for any complex number equation, if I can express z in terms of real and imaginary parts, I can then find its conjugate by changing the sign of the imaginary part. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using properties of complex conjugates. Let me think.The given equation is (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5. So, if I can solve for z, then take its conjugate, that should give me the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can take the conjugate of both sides of the equation first and see what happens. Let me try both approaches and see which is easier.Starting with solving for z:(z - 3)(2 - i) = 5So, to isolate z, I can divide both sides by (2 - i). Dividing complex numbers can be done by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. Let me do that.First, divide both sides by (2 - i):z - 3 = 5 / (2 - i)Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + i):z - 3 = [5*(2 + i)] / [(2 - i)(2 + i)]Compute the denominator: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5So, denominator is 5. Then numerator is 5*(2 + i) = 10 + 5iThus, z - 3 = (10 + 5i)/5 = 2 + iTherefore, z = 3 + 2 + i = 5 + iWait, is that right? Let me check the steps again.Starting equation: (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5Divide both sides by (2 - i):z - 3 = 5 / (2 - i)Multiply numerator and denominator by conjugate (2 + i):z - 3 = [5*(2 + i)] / [ (2)^2 + (1)^2 ] since (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 1 = 5So, denominator is 5, numerator is 5*(2 + i) = 10 + 5i. Divide by 5 gives 2 + i. So z - 3 = 2 + i. Therefore, z = 3 + 2 + i = 5 + i.So z = 5 + i. Therefore, the conjugate of z, which is denoted as bar{z}, is 5 - i. Looking at the options, D is 5 - i. So the answer should be D.But let me confirm this by another method, maybe taking conjugates of both sides first.Original equation: (z - 3)(2 - i) = 5Take conjugate of both sides. Remember that conjugate of a product is the product of conjugates, and conjugate of a real number (5) is itself.So, conjugate of left side: ( overline{z - 3} )( overline{2 - i} ) = ( overline{z} - 3 )(2 + i )Right side: conjugate of 5 is 5.Therefore, ( overline{z} - 3 )(2 + i ) = 5But if overline{z} is what we need to find, let's denote w = overline{z}. Then the equation becomes:(w - 3)(2 + i) = 5So, solving for w:w - 3 = 5 / (2 + i)Again, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of (2 + i), which is (2 - i):w - 3 = [5*(2 - i)] / [ (2 + i)(2 - i) ] = [10 - 5i]/5 = 2 - iTherefore, w = 3 + 2 - i = 5 - iHence, overline{z} = w = 5 - i, which is option D. So both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the correct answer is D.But let me check once again to ensure there's no mistake. Suppose z = 5 + i, then overline{z} = 5 - i. Let's verify the original equation:(z - 3) = (5 + i - 3) = 2 + iMultiply by (2 - i): (2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. Which matches the given equation. So yes, z = 5 + i is correct, so conjugate is 5 - i. Therefore, D is correct.I think that's thorough. Initially, I solved for z and then took the conjugate. Then I took the conjugate of the equation first and solved for overline{z} directly. Both approaches gave the same result, so I'm confident the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}</think>Given the equation ((z - 3)(2 - i) = 5), we need to find the conjugate of (z), denoted as (overline{z}).First, solve for (z):1.

Take the conjugate of both sides:   [   (overline{z - 3})(overline{2 - i}) = overline{5}   ]2. Simplify using properties of conjugates:   [   (overline{z} - 3)(2 + i) = 5   ]3. Let (w = overline{z}) and solve for (w):   [   w - 3 = frac{5}{2 + i}   ]4. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (2 - i):   [   w - 3 = frac{5(2 - i)}{(2 + i)(2 - i)} = frac{5(2 - i)}{5} = 2 - i   ]5. Isolate (w):   [   w = 3 + 2 - i = 5 - i   ]Thus, (overline{z} = 5 - i), which corresponds to option D.[boxed{D}]]"},{"problem":"Given that x in (e, e^2), a = ln x, b = (frac{1}{2})^{ln x}, c = e^{ln x}, determine the relationship among a, b, and c.A: c > b > aB: c > a > bC: a > b > cD: b > c > a","solution":"Since x in (e, e^2), we have ln x in (1, 2).

It is a basic-level question.","generations":"[<think>Okay, let me try to figure this problem out step by step. So, we have x in the interval (e, e²). That means x is a number between e (which is about 2.718) and e squared (which is roughly 7.389). Then they define a, b, and c in terms of ln x and some exponents. The question is asking about the relationship among a, b, and c. The options are A, B, C, D with different orderings. Let's break down each variable one by one.First, a is given as ln x. Since x is between e and e², let's think about the natural logarithm of x. Since ln e = 1 and ln e² = 2, so ln x would be between 1 and 2. Therefore, a is between 1 and 2. That's straightforward.Next, c is defined as e raised to the ln x. Wait, e raised to the natural log of x... Hmm, that simplifies, right? Because e^(ln x) is just x. Because e and ln are inverse functions. So, c = x. Therefore, c is the same as x. But we know x is between e and e², so c is between e and e². So, c is approximately between 2.718 and 7.389. That's helpful.Now, b is given as (1/2) raised to the ln x. So, (1/2)^{ln x}. Let's see. Let me write that down: b = (1/2)^{ln x}. Maybe we can rewrite this expression to make it easier to compare with a and c. Exponents can sometimes be tricky, but perhaps using properties of logarithms and exponents here.First, recall that (1/2) is the same as 2^{-1}, so (1/2)^{ln x} is equivalent to 2^{-ln x}. So, b = 2^{-ln x}. Hmm, maybe we can relate that to something else. Also, since exponents and logs can be manipulated, maybe express this in terms of e or ln? Let's see.Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of b to compare it with a? Wait, but maybe that complicates things. Let me think.Alternatively, express 2^{-ln x} as e^{-ln x * ln 2} because 2^{k} = e^{k ln 2}. So, 2^{-ln x} = e^{-ln x * ln 2}. Therefore, b = e^{-ln x * ln 2}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let's see.Alternatively, note that ln x is a, so b = (1/2)^a. Since a is between 1 and 2, so (1/2)^a would be between (1/2)^2 = 1/4 and (1/2)^1 = 1/2. So, b is between 1/4 and 1/2. Because a is between 1 and 2, so as a increases, (1/2)^a decreases. So, if a is 1, b is 1/2; if a is 2, b is 1/4. So, b is between 0.25 and 0.5.Wait, but c is between e (~2.718) and e² (~7.389). So, c is around 3 to 7, a is between 1 and 2, and b is between 0.25 and 0.5.Therefore, in terms of magnitude, c is the largest, then a, then b. So, c > a > b. Which would correspond to option B.But wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Given that x is between e and e², so c = x is between e and e². So, c is approximately between 2.718 and 7.389. Then a = ln x, so since x is between e and e², ln x is between 1 and 2, so a is between 1 and 2. Then b is (1/2)^{ln x} = (1/2)^a. So since a is between 1 and 2, (1/2)^a is between 1/2 and 1/4. Therefore, b is between 0.25 and 0.5. Therefore, c is the largest, a is next, and b is the smallest. So, c > a > b. Which is option B.Wait, but let me check if there's any possibility that b could be greater than a or something. For example, take a specific value of x in (e, e²). Let's pick x = e^1.5, which is sqrt(e^3) ≈ 4.481. Then, a = ln x = 1.5, which is in (1, 2). Then b = (1/2)^{1.5} = (1/2)^{3/2} = (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^{1/2} = 1/2 * 1/√2 ≈ 0.5 * 0.707 ≈ 0.3535. So, b ≈ 0.3535. Then c = x ≈ 4.481. So, comparing them: c ≈4.481, a=1.5, b≈0.3535. So, c > a > b. That's the same as before.Another example: take x = e^2 (but x is less than e^2, so approaching e^2). Then a approaches 2, b approaches (1/2)^2 = 1/4 =0.25, c approaches e^2 ≈7.389. So, c approaches 7.389, a approaches 2, b approaches 0.25. So again, c > a > b.If x approaches e from above, then a approaches 1, b approaches (1/2)^1 = 0.5, and c approaches e ≈2.718. So, c approaches 2.718, a approaches 1, b approaches 0.5. Then c is still larger than a (2.718 >1), a is larger than b (1 >0.5). So again, c >a >b.Therefore, in all cases within the interval (e, e²), c is the largest, a is in the middle, and b is the smallest. So the correct answer is B: c > a > b.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't overlook any properties. Let me check if there's another way to express b that might relate it differently. For example, using logarithm properties.Starting again with b = (1/2)^{ln x}. Let's write that as e^{ln(1/2) * ln x} because a^b = e^{b ln a}. So, (1/2)^{ln x} = e^{(ln x)(ln(1/2))}. But ln(1/2) is equal to -ln 2. Therefore, b = e^{- ln 2 * ln x}.Alternatively, note that ln x is a, so b = e^{- ln 2 * a} = e^{-a ln 2} = (e^{ln 2})^{-a} = 2^{-a}. Which is the same as before. So, that's consistent with earlier reasoning. So, b = 2^{-a}. Since a is between 1 and 2, so 2^{-a} is between 1/4 and 1/2. So, yeah, that's correct.Alternatively, if I wanted to compare a and c directly. c is x, and a is ln x. Since x > e, ln x >1. But c =x is definitely larger than a = ln x because for x > e, x > ln x. For example, at x=e, ln x =1, x=e≈2.718, so x > ln x. As x increases, x grows much faster than ln x, so x is always larger than ln x for x >1. Therefore, c =x > a=ln x. Then we already saw that a=ln x > b=(1/2)^{ln x} because (1/2)^{ln x} is less than 1/2, which is less than 1, and a is between 1 and 2. So, even more so, a is greater than b.Therefore, combining both results: c > a and a > b, so c > a > b. Therefore, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given that ( x in (e, e^2) ), we need to determine the relationship among ( a = ln x ), ( b = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{ln x} ), and ( c = e^{ln x} ).1. Determine ( a ):   - Since ( x ) is between ( e ) and ( e^2 ), ( ln x ) is between 1 and 2. Therefore, ( a in (1, 2) ).2. Determine ( c ):   - ( c = e^{ln x} = x ). Since ( x in (e, e^2) ), ( c in (e, e^2) approx (2.718, 7.389) ).3. Determine ( b ):   - ( b = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{ln x} ). This can be rewritten as ( 2^{-ln x} ). Using the property of exponents, ( 2^{-ln x} = e^{-ln x cdot ln 2} ). Since ( ln x ) is between 1 and 2, ( -ln x cdot ln 2 ) is between ( -2 ln 2 ) and ( -ln 2 ). Thus, ( b ) is between ( 2^{-2} = frac{1}{4} ) and ( 2^{-1} = frac{1}{2} ), i.e., ( b in (0.25, 0.5) ).4. Compare ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ):   - ( c ) (which is ( x )) is between 2.718 and 7.389.   - ( a ) (which is ( ln x )) is between 1 and 2.   - ( b ) is between 0.25 and 0.5.Thus, the order from largest to smallest is ( c > a > b ).The correct answer is (boxed{B}).,<think>Okay, let's see. The problem says that x is between e and e squared. So x is a number greater than e but less than e². Then they define a, b, and c in terms of ln x and exponentials. We need to figure out the relationship among a, b, and c. The options are A to D, with different orderings. Hmm.First, let me write down what each of a, b, and c is:a = ln x. So since x is between e and e², then ln x would be between ln e and ln e², right? Since the natural logarithm is an increasing function. So ln e is 1, and ln e² is 2. Therefore, a is between 1 and 2. So a ∈ (1, 2).Then b = (1/2)^{ln x}. Let's see. That's the same as (1/2)^{a} since a is ln x. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite this expression using properties of exponents. Remember that (1/2)^{ln x} is equal to e^{ln(1/2) * ln x}? Wait, maybe it's better to use a different base. Let's think.Alternatively, (1/2)^{ln x} can be written as e^{(ln(1/2)) * ln x} because a^b = e^{b ln a}. So here, a is 1/2 and b is ln x. So that's e^{(ln(1/2)) * ln x}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, note that (1/2)^{ln x} is equal to x^{ln(1/2)}. Because (a)^{b} = e^{b ln a} = (e^{ln a})^{b} = a^b, but also, x^{c} = e^{c ln x}, so if we have (1/2)^{ln x} = e^{ln(1/2) * ln x} = x^{ln(1/2)}. Since ln(1/2) is negative, that would make this x raised to a negative power, which is 1 over x^{|ln(1/2)|}. Let's compute ln(1/2): ln(1/2) = -ln 2 ≈ -0.693. Therefore, (1/2)^{ln x} = x^{-0.693} = 1 / x^{0.693}.Since x is between e and e², x is approximately between 2.718 and 7.389. So x^{0.693} would be, let's see, for x = e, e^{0.693} ≈ e^{ln 2} because ln 2 ≈ 0.693. Wait, ln 2 is approximately 0.693, so e^{ln 2} = 2. So x^{ln 2} = 2 when x = e. Wait, hold on, if x is e, then x^{ln 2} = e^{ln 2} = 2. Similarly, if x is e², then x^{ln 2} = (e²)^{ln 2} = e^{2 ln 2} = (e^{ln 2})² = 2² = 4. So x^{ln 2} is between 2 and 4. Therefore, 1 / x^{ln 2} is between 1/4 and 1/2. But wait, but in our case, b = x^{ln(1/2)} = 1 / x^{ln 2}. So that would mean that b is between 1/4 and 1/2. Wait, but x is between e and e², so x is about 2.718 to 7.389. So x^{ln 2} when x is e is e^{ln 2} = 2, so 1/x^{ln 2} is 1/2. When x is e², x^{ln 2} = (e²)^{ln 2} = e^{2 ln 2} = (e^{ln 2})² = 2² = 4, so 1/x^{ln 2} = 1/4. Therefore, as x increases from e to e², b decreases from 1/2 to 1/4. So b ∈ (1/4, 1/2). So b is between 0.25 and 0.5.Then c = e^{ln x}. Well, e^{ln x} is just x. Because e and ln are inverse functions. So c = x. Since x is between e and e², c is between e and e², which is approximately between 2.718 and 7.389.So summarizing:- a is between 1 and 2.- b is between 0.25 and 0.5.- c is between ~2.718 and ~7.389.Therefore, in terms of size, c is the largest, then a, then b. So c > a > b. That would be option B.Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with a = ln x. Since x ∈ (e, e²), ln x ∈ (1, 2). Correct.b = (1/2)^{ln x}. Let me compute this value. For example, if x = e, then ln x = 1, so b = (1/2)^1 = 1/2. If x = e², ln x = 2, so b = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So as x increases from e to e², b decreases from 1/2 to 1/4. So b is in (1/4, 1/2). Correct.c = e^{ln x} = x. So c is between e and e², which is about 2.718 to 7.389. So c is the largest. Then a is between 1 and 2, so a is next. Then b is between 0.25 and 0.5, so the smallest. Therefore, c > a > b. So the correct order is B: c > a > b.Wait, but let me think if there's any possible mistake here. Let's take a specific example. Suppose x is e, so a = ln e = 1, b = (1/2)^1 = 1/2, c = e. So c ≈ 2.718, a = 1, b = 0.5. So c > a > b. If x is e², a = ln e² = 2, b = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, c = e² ≈ 7.389. So again, c > a > b. For a middle value, say x = e^(1.5), which is sqrt(e^3) ≈ 4.481. Then a = 1.5, b = (1/2)^{1.5} = (1/2)^(3/2) = 1/(2^(3/2)) = 1/(2*sqrt(2)) ≈ 1/2.828 ≈ 0.3535, and c = x ≈ 4.481. So again, c ≈4.481 > a=1.5 > b≈0.3535. So in all cases, the order is c > a > b, so the answer should be B. Therefore, option B is correct.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given that ( x in (e, e^2) ), we need to determine the relationship among ( a = ln x ), ( b = left( frac{1}{2} right)^{ln x} ), and ( c = e^{ln x} ).1. For ( a = ln x ):   - Since ( x ) is between ( e ) and ( e^2 ), taking the natural logarithm of ( x ) gives ( ln x ) in the interval ( (1, 2) ). Therefore, ( a in (1, 2) ).2. For ( b = left( frac{1}{2} right)^{ln x} ):   - This can be rewritten using properties of exponents as ( x^{ln(1/2)} ). Since ( ln(1/2) = -ln 2 approx -0.693 ), we have ( b = x^{-0.693} ).   - When ( x = e ), ( b = left( frac{1}{2} right)^1 = frac{1}{2} ). When ( x = e^2 ), ( b = left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{4} ). Thus, ( b ) decreases from ( frac{1}{2} ) to ( frac{1}{4} ) as ( x ) increases from ( e ) to ( e^2 ), so ( b in (0.25, 0.5) ).3.

The problem is:log 2^{2}+log 3^{1+frac{1}{2 x}}-log left(3^{frac{1}{x}}+3^{3}right)>0First, I need to simplify this expression using logarithm properties. Remember that log a + log b = log(ab) and log a - log b = logleft(frac{a}{b}right). Let me apply these properties here.Starting with the first term, log 2^{2} is straightforward. That simplifies to 2log 2 because log a^b = blog a. Similarly, the second term is log 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}, which can be written as left(1 + frac{1}{2x}right)log 3. The third term is a logarithm subtracted, so that will become part of the denominator when we combine them.Putting it all together, the left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality can be rewritten as:log left(2^{2} times 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}} div left(3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}right)right)So, the inequality simplifies to:log left( frac{4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} right) > 0Since the logarithm is greater than 0, that means the argument inside the logarithm must be greater than 1 (because log_{10} y > 0 implies y > 10^0 = 1 if the base is 10, but here the base isn't specified. Wait, hold on. In the original problem, the logarithms are written without a base. In many contexts, especially in math problems, if the base isn't specified, it's either base 10 or base e. However, given the presence of numbers like 2 and 3, which are common in base 10, but also 3s in exponents, it's possible the base is 10. But actually, the base might not matter here because we are dealing with inequalities where the logarithm is compared to 0. The key is that logarithm is an increasing function if the base is greater than 1, which both 10 and e satisfy. So regardless of the base, log z > 0 implies z > 1. So, the inequality reduces to:frac{4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} > 1Alright, so now we can write:4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}} > 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27Let me simplify the left-hand side. The exponent is 1 + frac{1}{2x}, so 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}} = 3 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}} = 3 cdot sqrt{3^{frac{1}{x}}} because 3^{frac{1}{2x}} = left(3^{frac{1}{x}}right)^{1/2}.So substituting back, the left side becomes:4 cdot 3 cdot sqrt{3^{frac{1}{x}}} = 12 sqrt{3^{frac{1}{x}}}Therefore, the inequality is:12 sqrt{3^{frac{1}{x}}} > 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let me set y = 3^{frac{1}{x}}. Then, since 3^{frac{1}{x}} is always positive for any real x (except x=0, which is undefined), y > 0. The inequality becomes:12 sqrt{y} > y + 27Let me rearrange this inequality:12 sqrt{y} - y - 27 > 0Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of sqrt{y}. Let's let t = sqrt{y}, so y = t^2. Then substituting:12t - t^2 - 27 > 0 - t^2 + 12 t - 27 > 0 Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality sign):t^2 - 12 t + 27 < 0Now, solving the quadratic inequality t^2 - 12t + 27 < 0. First, find the roots of t^2 - 12t + 27 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:t = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 108}}{2} = frac{12 pm sqrt{36}}{2} = frac{12 pm 6}{2}Thus, the roots are:t = frac{12 + 6}{2} = 9 quad text{and} quad t = frac{12 - 6}{2} = 3The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of t^2 is positive), so the inequality t^2 - 12t + 27 < 0 is satisfied between the roots:3 < t < 9But remember t = sqrt{y} and y = 3^{frac{1}{x}}. Therefore:3 < sqrt{y} < 9 implies 9 < y < 81 quad text{(squaring all parts)}But y = 3^{frac{1}{x}}, so:9 < 3^{frac{1}{x}} < 81Express 9 and 81 as powers of 3:3^2 < 3^{frac{1}{x}} < 3^4Since the base 3 is greater than 1, the inequality of exponents preserves the inequality direction:2 < frac{1}{x} < 4Now, solve for x. Let's split this into two inequalities:1. frac{1}{x} > 22. frac{1}{x} < 4But we need to consider the sign of x when solving these inequalities because multiplying both sides by x can reverse the inequality depending on whether x is positive or negative.First, note that in the original inequality, there is a term frac{1}{2x} in the exponent. For the exponent to be defined, x cannot be zero. Additionally, 3^{frac{1}{x}} requires that frac{1}{x} is a real number, which it is as long as x neq 0. So, x neq 0.But when solving frac{1}{x} > 2 and frac{1}{x} < 4, we need to find x values such that both inequalities are satisfied.Let me analyze each inequality:1. frac{1}{x} > 2If x > 0, multiplying both sides by x gives 1 > 2x ⇒ x < 1/2.If x < 0, multiplying both sides by x (negative) reverses the inequality: 1 < 2x ⇒ x > 1/2, but since x < 0, this is impossible. Therefore, the solution to frac{1}{x} > 2 is 0 < x < 1/2.2. frac{1}{x} < 4If x > 0, multiplying both sides by x gives 1 < 4x ⇒ x > 1/4.If x < 0, multiplying both sides by x reverses the inequality: 1 > 4x ⇒ x < 1/4, but since x < 0, this is always true. Therefore, the solution to frac{1}{x} < 4 is x > 1/4 or x < 0.Now, the original combined inequality is 2 < frac{1}{x} < 4, which is equivalent to the intersection of the solutions to both inequalities. So, we need the intersection of 0 < x < 1/2 and x > 1/4 or x < 0. Let's break it down:- For 0 < x < 1/2 (from first inequality), the second inequality requires x > 1/4 or x < 0. Since we are already in 0 < x < 1/2, the overlapping region with x > 1/4 is 1/4 < x < 1/2.- For x < 0, from the second inequality, but the first inequality frac{1}{x} > 2 had no solution for x < 0, so there's no overlap here.Therefore, the solution to 2 < frac{1}{x} < 4 is 1/4 < x < 1/2.But wait, let me verify this step again. Because when we have 2 < frac{1}{x} < 4, it's equivalent to frac{1}{x} > 2 and frac{1}{x} < 4. As we found, the solution is 1/4 < x < 1/2.But let me check with test values.Take x = 1/3 (which is approximately 0.333), which is between 1/4 (0.25) and 1/2 (0.5). Then, frac{1}{x} = 3, which is between 2 and 4. So that works.Take x = 1/5 (0.2), which is less than 1/4. Then, frac{1}{x} = 5, which is greater than 4, so it doesn't satisfy the upper bound.Take x = 1/2 (0.5), frac{1}{x} = 2, which is equal to the lower bound, but the inequality is strict, so it's excluded.Take x = 1/4 (0.25), frac{1}{x} = 4, which is equal to the upper bound, excluded as well.So yes, the solution interval is indeed 1/4 < x < 1/2.But hold on, before finalizing this, we need to check the original inequality's domain. In the original problem, we have log left(3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}right). The argument of the logarithm must be positive. Let's verify that 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27 is positive. Since 3^{frac{1}{x}} is always positive (as an exponential function) and 27 is positive, their sum is positive. Therefore, the domain of the original inequality is all real numbers except x = 0. However, our solution interval 1/4 < x < 1/2 is within x > 0, so we are okay.But wait, another thing to check: when we made the substitution t = sqrt{y}, y = 3^{1/x}, we need to make sure that y is positive, which it is, so t is positive. Also, when solving the quadratic inequality t^2 -12t +27 <0, we found 3 < t <9, which translates back to 9 < y <81, which translates to 2 < 1/x <4, leading to 1/4 <x <1/2. So that seems consistent.But let me verify if this interval actually satisfies the original inequality. Let's pick a value in the interval, say x = 1/3, which is 0.333...Compute each part:First, compute the original expression:log 2^2 + log 3^{1 + 1/(2x)} - log(3^{1/x} + 3^3)For x = 1/3:Compute each term:1. log 2^2 = log 4 ≈ 0.60206 (assuming base 10)2. Exponent in the second term: 1 + 1/(2*(1/3)) = 1 + 3/2 = 2.5, so log 3^{2.5} = 2.5 log 3 ≈ 2.5 * 0.4771 ≈ 1.19283. Third term: 3^{1/(1/3)} + 27 = 3^3 + 27 = 27 + 27 = 54, so log 54 ≈ 1.7324So total expression: 0.60206 + 1.1928 - 1.7324 ≈ (0.60206 + 1.1928) - 1.7324 ≈ 1.79486 - 1.7324 ≈ 0.06246 > 0. So it satisfies the inequality.Now check a value outside the interval, say x = 1/5 = 0.2, which is less than 1/4. Then:1. log 4 ≈ 0.602062. Exponent: 1 + 1/(2*0.2) = 1 + 1/0.4 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5, so log 3^{3.5} = 3.5 log 3 ≈ 3.5*0.4771 ≈ 1.669853. Third term: 3^{1/0.2} + 27 = 3^5 + 27 = 243 + 27 = 270, so log 270 ≈ 2.4314Total expression: 0.60206 + 1.66985 - 2.4314 ≈ (0.60206 + 1.66985) - 2.4314 ≈ 2.2719 - 2.4314 ≈ -0.1595 < 0. So it does not satisfy the inequality, which is consistent.Another test at x = 1/2 = 0.5 (boundary):1. log 4 ≈ 0.602062. Exponent: 1 + 1/(2*0.5) = 1 + 1/1 = 2, so log 3^2 = 2 log 3 ≈ 0.95423. Third term: 3^{1/0.5} + 27 = 3^2 + 27 = 9 + 27 = 36, log 36 ≈ 1.5563Total expression: 0.60206 + 0.9542 - 1.5563 ≈ 1.55626 - 1.5563 ≈ -0.00004, which is approximately zero. Since the inequality is strict (> 0), x = 1/2 is excluded.Similarly, at x = 1/4 = 0.25:1. log 4 ≈ 0.602062. Exponent: 1 + 1/(2*0.25) = 1 + 2 = 3, so log 3^3 = 3 log 3 ≈ 1.43143. Third term: 3^{1/0.25} + 27 = 3^4 + 27 = 81 + 27 = 108, log 108 ≈ 2.0334Total expression: 0.60206 + 1.4314 - 2.0334 ≈ 2.03346 - 2.0334 ≈ 0.00006 ≈ 0, so again, approximately zero. Hence, x = 1/4 is excluded as well.Therefore, the solution interval is indeed 1/4 < x < 1/2.But hold on, let me also check a value greater than 1/2, like x = 1. Then:1. log 4 ≈ 0.602062. Exponent: 1 + 1/(2*1) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5, so log 3^{1.5} ≈ 1.5 * 0.4771 ≈ 0.715653. Third term: 3^{1/1} + 27 = 3 + 27 = 30, log 30 ≈ 1.4771Total expression: 0.60206 + 0.71565 - 1.4771 ≈ 1.3177 - 1.4771 ≈ -0.1594 < 0, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.Another check at x approaching 0 from the positive side, say x = 0.1:1. log 4 ≈ 0.602062. Exponent: 1 + 1/(2*0.1) = 1 + 5 = 6, so log 3^6 ≈ 6 * 0.4771 ≈ 2.86263. Third term: 3^{10} + 27 = 59049 + 27 = 59076, log 59076 ≈ 4.7715Total expression: 0.60206 + 2.8626 - 4.7715 ≈ 3.46466 - 4.7715 ≈ -1.3068 < 0. Doesn't satisfy.So, all tests confirm that the solution interval is indeed between 1/4 and 1/2.Therefore, the final answer is frac{1}{4} < x < frac{1}{2}, which in boxed form is:Final AnswerThe solution to the inequality is boxed{left( frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2} right)}.</think>To solve the inequalitylog 2^{2}+log 3^{1+frac{1}{2 x}}-log left(3^{frac{1}{x}}+3^{3}right)>0,we start by simplifying the logarithmic expressions using logarithm properties. This allows us to rewrite the inequality as:log left( frac{4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} right) > 0.Since the logarithm is greater than 0, the argument inside the logarithm must be greater than 1:frac{4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} > 1.Simplifying this, we get:12 sqrt{3^{frac{1}{x}}} > 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27.Letting ( y = 3^{frac{1}{x}} ), the inequality becomes:12 sqrt{y} > y + 27.Substituting ( t = sqrt{y} ), we transform this into a quadratic inequality:t^2 - 12t + 27 < 0.Solving this quadratic inequality, we find the roots ( t = 3 ) and ( t = 9 ), leading to the interval ( 3 < t < 9 ). Converting back to ( y ) and then to ( x ), we get:9 < 3^{frac{1}{x}} < 81 implies 2 < frac{1}{x} < 4.Solving ( 2 < frac{1}{x} < 4 ) for ( x ), we find the interval ( frac{1}{4} < x < frac{1}{2} ).Thus, the solution to the inequality is:boxed{left( frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2} right)}.\`\`\`,<think>Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: log 2^{2} + log 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}} - log left(3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}right) > 0Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that logarithms have some properties that let me combine terms. Maybe I can simplify this expression using those properties. Let me recall: log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), and log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Also, exponents inside logs can be brought out as multipliers. Starting with the first term, log 2^{2}. Since the exponent is 2, I can bring that in front: 2 log 2. Similarly, the second term is log 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}. The exponent here is 1 + frac{1}{2x}, so that becomes left(1 + frac{1}{2x}right) log 3. The third term is a subtraction of a log, so that will become the log of the numerator divided by the denominator. Let me write that out:So, combining the logs:2 log 2 + left(1 + frac{1}{2x}right) log 3 - log left(3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}right) > 0Wait, maybe instead of splitting them up, I can combine the first two terms first. Let's see:log 2^{2} + log 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}} = log left(2^{2} cdot 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}right). Then subtract the third log term, which would be equivalent to dividing by that term inside the log. So:log left( frac{2^{2} cdot 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}} right) > 0Okay, so the entire left side is a single logarithm. The inequality is that this log is greater than 0. Since log is a monotonically increasing function, log y > 0 implies that y > 10^{0} = 1 if it's base 10. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the base of the logarithm. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, in many contexts, especially in math problems without specification, log can be base 10 or natural logarithm. Wait, but in higher mathematics, sometimes log is used for natural logarithm. But here, since the expressions inside the logs are 2, 3, etc., maybe it's base 10? Or maybe base 3? Wait, no, because there are logs of 2 and 3. So perhaps it's base 10? Hmm. The problem statement is in Chinese maybe? Wait, no, the problem is given in English here. Wait, the original instruction is in English. So, the problem is presented with unspecified base. Hmm. Wait, but in many cases, log without a base can be assumed to be base 10, especially in high school math. Alternatively, sometimes in problems involving exponents with base 3 or 2, maybe they use natural log? But the key point is that the inequality is log(something) > 0. So regardless of the base, log(something) > 0 means that something > 1, because log(1) is 0 in any base, and the log function is increasing. So if it's base 10, log10(1) = 0; if it's natural log, ln(1) = 0. So regardless, the inequality log(expression) > 0 implies expression > 1. So maybe we don't need to know the base here. That's a relief.Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:frac{2^{2} cdot 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}} > 1So now, let's compute the numerator and the denominator. Let's simplify:First, numerator: 2^{2} cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}} = 4 cdot 3^{1} cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}} = 4 cdot 3 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}} = 12 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}}.Denominator: 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3} = 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27.So the inequality is:frac{12 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} > 1Alright, so now we need to solve:12 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}} > 3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27Let me rewrite that:12 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}} - 3^{frac{1}{x}} - 27 > 0Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe substitution will help. Let me set y = 3^{frac{1}{2x}}. Then, y^2 = left(3^{frac{1}{2x}}right)^2 = 3^{frac{1}{x}}. So, substituting into the inequality:12y - y^2 - 27 > 0Which rearranges to:- y^2 + 12y - 27 > 0 Rightarrow y^2 - 12y + 27 < 0So, quadratic inequality: y^2 - 12y + 27 < 0. Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation y^2 - 12y + 27 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:y = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 108}}{2} = frac{12 pm sqrt{36}}{2} = frac{12 pm 6}{2}So, the roots are:y = frac{12 + 6}{2} = 9 quad text{and} quad y = frac{12 - 6}{2} = 3Therefore, the quadratic y^2 -12y +27 factors as (y - 3)(y - 9). So, the inequality (y - 3)(y - 9) < 0 holds when y is between 3 and 9. Since the quadratic opens upwards, it's negative between the roots. Therefore, 3 < y < 9.But y = 3^{frac{1}{2x}}, so:3 < 3^{frac{1}{2x}} < 9Since 9 is 3 squared, so 9 = 3^2. Therefore, the inequality becomes:3^1 < 3^{frac{1}{2x}} < 3^2Because the base 3 is greater than 1, the inequality of exponents follows the same order. Therefore:1 < frac{1}{2x} < 2Wait, hold on. If 3^a < 3^b < 3^c, then a < b < c. So, here:Lower bound: 3^1 < 3^{frac{1}{2x}} implies 1 < frac{1}{2x}.Upper bound: 3^{frac{1}{2x}} < 3^2 implies frac{1}{2x} < 2.So, combining both:1 < frac{1}{2x} and frac{1}{2x} < 2.But let's solve these inequalities one by one.First inequality: 1 < frac{1}{2x}Multiply both sides by 2x. Wait, but here we have to be careful about the sign of x. Because multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality. So, we need to determine if 2x is positive or negative.Given that y = 3^{frac{1}{2x}} is defined only if the exponent frac{1}{2x} is a real number. Since 3 is positive, the exponent can be any real number, but for the expression to be defined, the exponent must be a real number. Therefore, frac{1}{2x} must be a real number, which implies that x ne 0. Also, 3 raised to any real number is positive, so y is positive regardless.But when solving inequalities with variables in denominators, we have to consider the sign of the denominator. Let's analyze the possible values of x.First, x cannot be zero. So, x in mathbb{R} setminus {0}.But when we have 1/(2x), if x is positive, then 1/(2x) is positive. If x is negative, then 1/(2x) is negative. But in our original substitution, y = 3^{1/(2x)}, which is 3 raised to some exponent. If the exponent is negative, y would be between 0 and 1. However, in our previous step, we found that 3 < y < 9, which is between 3 and 9. Since 3^{positive} is greater than 1, so the exponent must be positive. Therefore, 1/(2x) > 0, which implies that x > 0.Therefore, from the substitution step, we can conclude that x > 0. Because if x were negative, y would be 3^{negative} which is less than 1, but we have y > 3, so x must be positive. Therefore, x > 0.Therefore, we can safely multiply both sides by 2x without reversing the inequality.First inequality: 1 < frac{1}{2x}Multiply both sides by 2x (positive, so inequality direction remains):2x cdot 1 < 1Which is:2x < 1 implies x < 1/2Second inequality: frac{1}{2x} < 2Multiply both sides by 2x (positive):1 < 4x implies 4x > 1 implies x > 1/4So combining the two inequalities from the bounds on y:1/4 < x < 1/2But we also need to make sure that in the original inequality, the denominator 3^{1/x} + 27 is not zero. But since 3^{1/x} is always positive for real x ne 0, the denominator is always positive (as 27 is positive). So there's no issue with the denominator being zero or negative. So the only constraints are from the inequality 3 < y < 9 leading to 1/4 < x < 1/2.But wait, let me double-check. The substitution led us to 3 < 3^{1/(2x)} < 9, which we converted to 1 < 1/(2x) < 2, leading to 1/4 < x < 1/2. But let's verify with an example.Take x = 1/3, which is approximately 0.333..., which is between 1/4 (0.25) and 1/2 (0.5). Then 1/(2x) = 1/(2*(1/3)) = 3/2 = 1.5. Then y = 3^{1.5} = 3^(3/2) = sqrt(3^3) = sqrt(27) ≈ 5.196, which is between 3 and 9. So that works. If x is 1/4, then 1/(2x) = 2, so y = 3^2 = 9, which is the upper bound. But since the inequality is strict (we have <), x cannot be 1/4 or 1/2.Wait, but let's check when x approaches 1/2 from the left. Then 1/(2x) approaches 1/(2*(1/2)) = 1, so y approaches 3^1 = 3. But the original inequality is y > 3, so x approaching 1/2 from the left would make y approach 3 from above. Wait, actually, when x approaches 1/2 from the left, 2x approaches 1 from below, so 1/(2x) approaches 1 from above. Therefore, y approaches 3^{1+} which is slightly more than 3, so y approaches 3 from above. Similarly, when x approaches 1/4 from the right, 1/(2x) approaches 2 from below, so y approaches 9 from below. Therefore, the interval for x is indeed (1/4, 1/2).But let's also check if x is outside that interval. For example, x = 1/5 (which is 0.2 < 1/4). Then 1/(2x) = 1/(0.4) = 2.5, so y = 3^2.5 ≈ 15.588, which is greater than 9. Therefore, the inequality y < 9 is violated, so x cannot be 1/5. Similarly, x = 1, which is greater than 1/2. Then 1/(2x) = 0.5, so y = 3^0.5 ≈ 1.732, which is less than 3, violating the lower bound. So indeed, only between 1/4 and 1/2 does y satisfy 3 < y < 9.Therefore, the solution set is x in (1/4, 1/2). But wait, before finalizing, let's plug back into the original inequality to verify.Take x = 1/3 (which is within the interval). Let's compute each term:First term: log(2^2) = log(4) ≈ 0.602 (assuming base 10).Second term: log(3^{1 + 1/(2x)}) = log(3^{1 + 3/2}) = log(3^{5/2}) = (5/2) log 3 ≈ (5/2)(0.477) ≈ 1.1925.Third term: log(3^{1/x} + 27) = log(3^3 + 27) = log(27 + 27) = log(54) ≈ 1.732.So total expression: 0.602 + 1.1925 - 1.732 ≈ 0.0625 > 0. Which is true.Another test with x = 0.3 (which is 3/10, within (1/4, 1/2)):First term: log(4) ≈ 0.602.Second term: exponent is 1 + 1/(2*0.3) = 1 + 1/0.6 ≈ 1 + 1.666 ≈ 2.666. So log(3^{2.666}) ≈ 2.666 * 0.477 ≈ 1.272.Third term: 3^{1/0.3} + 27. 1/0.3 ≈ 3.333, so 3^{3.333} ≈ 3^3 * 3^{0.333} ≈ 27 * 1.442 ≈ 38.934. Then 38.934 + 27 ≈ 65.934. log(65.934) ≈ 1.819.Total expression: 0.602 + 1.272 - 1.819 ≈ 0.055 > 0. Still positive.Now, check x approaching 1/4 from above, say x = 0.26:1/(2x) ≈ 1/(0.52) ≈ 1.923, so y = 3^{1.923} ≈ 3^(2 - 0.077) ≈ 9 / 3^{0.077}. 3^0.077 ≈ e^{0.077 ln 3} ≈ e^{0.077 * 1.0986} ≈ e^{0.0846} ≈ 1.088. So y ≈ 9 / 1.088 ≈ 8.27. Then numerator: 12 * 8.27 ≈ 99.24. Denominator: 3^{1/0.26} + 27. 1/0.26 ≈ 3.846. 3^3.846 ≈ 3^3 * 3^0.846 ≈ 27 * (3^0.846). Let's compute 3^0.846: ln(3^0.846) = 0.846 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.929. So e^0.929 ≈ 2.532. Therefore, 27 * 2.532 ≈ 68.364. Denominator: 68.364 + 27 = 95.364. So the ratio is 99.24 / 95.364 ≈ 1.04 > 1. So the inequality holds.Similarly, approaching 1/2 from below, x = 0.49:1/(2x) ≈ 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. So y = 3^{1.0204} ≈ 3 * 3^{0.0204} ≈ 3 * e^{0.0204 * ln3} ≈ 3 * e^{0.0204 * 1.0986} ≈ 3 * e^{0.0224} ≈ 3 * 1.0227 ≈ 3.068. Numerator: 12 * 3.068 ≈ 36.816. Denominator: 3^{1/0.49} + 27 ≈ 3^{2.0408} + 27 ≈ 9 * 3^{0.0408} + 27 ≈ 9 * e^{0.0408 * 1.0986} ≈ 9 * e^{0.0448} ≈ 9 * 1.046 ≈ 9.414 + 27 ≈ 36.414. Ratio: 36.816 / 36.414 ≈ 1.011 > 1. So still holds.At x = 1/4, which is 0.25:1/(2x) = 2, so y = 9. Numerator: 12 * 9 = 108. Denominator: 3^{4} + 27 = 81 + 27 = 108. So ratio 108 / 108 = 1. So equality holds. But original inequality is strict (> 0), so x = 1/4 is excluded.Similarly, x = 1/2:1/(2x) = 1. y = 3. Numerator: 12 * 3 = 36. Denominator: 3^{2} + 27 = 9 + 27 = 36. Ratio 36 / 36 = 1. Again equality, so x = 1/2 is excluded.Therefore, the solution is indeed all real numbers x such that 1/4 < x < 1/2.But let me check if there's any other constraints. For example, original logarithm expressions: log(2^2), log(3^{...}), log(...). These are all defined as long as their arguments are positive. 2^2 is 4, which is positive. 3^{1 + 1/(2x)} is always positive since 3^anything is positive. The denominator inside the log is 3^{1/x} + 27, which is also positive. So all logs are defined as long as x ≠ 0, but we already established x > 0 from the substitution step. So the only constraints are 1/4 < x < 1/2.Hence, the solution is x ∈ (1/4, 1/2). To write this in boxed notation as per the instruction:boxed{left( frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2} right)}Final AnswerThe solution to the inequality is boxed{left( frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2} right)}.</think>To solve the inequality log 2^{2} + log 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}} - log left(3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}right) > 0,we start by combining the logarithms using their properties. This simplifies the inequality to:log left( frac{2^{2} cdot 3^{1+frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 3^{3}} right) > 0.Since the logarithm is greater than 0, the argument inside the logarithm must be greater than 1:frac{4 cdot 3^{1 + frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} > 1.Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:frac{12 cdot 3^{frac{1}{2x}}}{3^{frac{1}{x}} + 27} > 1.Letting ( y = 3^{frac{1}{2x}} ), we substitute to get:12y - y^2 - 27 > 0.This quadratic inequality simplifies to:y^2 - 12y + 27 < 0.Solving the quadratic equation ( y^2 - 12y + 27 = 0 ), we find the roots ( y = 9 ) and ( y = 3 ). The inequality holds for ( 3 < y < 9 ), which translates to:3 < 3^{frac{1}{2x}} < 9.Taking logarithms, we convert this to:1 < frac{1}{2x} < 2.Solving for ( x ), we get:frac{1}{4} < x < frac{1}{2}.Thus, the solution to the inequality is:boxed{left( frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2} right)}.\`\`\`]"},{"problem":"3. If the complex number z satisfies |z+3-sqrt{3} i|=sqrt{3}, then the minimum value of arg z isA. frac{pi}{6}B. frac{pi}{3}C. frac{2}{3} piD. frac{5}{6} pi","solution":"3. C (x+3)^{2}+(y-sqrt{3})^{2}=3, z lies on a circle.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a complex number z satisfies |z + 3 - √3 i| = √3, and I have to find the minimum value of arg z. The options are given in terms of π, which suggests the answer is one of the standard angles like π/6, π/3, etc. Let me think step by step.First, complex numbers can be represented geometrically in the complex plane, right? So, the equation |z + 3 - √3 i| = √3 is the set of all points z in the complex plane that are at a distance √3 away from the point (-3, √3). Because in general, |z - a| = r represents a circle with center at a and radius r. But here it's |z + 3 - √3 i|, which can be rewritten as |z - (-3 + √3 i)| = √3. So the center is at (-3, √3) and radius √3.Now, the question is about the argument of z, which is the angle made with the positive real axis. We need to find the minimum value of arg z. So, essentially, among all the points z on this circle, which one makes the smallest angle with the positive real axis? The argument is measured from the positive real axis, increasing counterclockwise. So the smaller the angle, the closer the point is to the positive real axis in the counterclockwise direction. Wait, actually, arguments can range between 0 and 2π (or sometimes -π to π), but the minimum value here would be the smallest non-negative angle such that the point is on that circle.Let me visualize this. The center of the circle is at (-3, √3). Let's plot this point. The real part is -3, so it's 3 units to the left on the real axis, and the imaginary part is √3, which is approximately 1.732, so up about 1.732 units on the imaginary axis. The radius of the circle is √3, which is the same as the imaginary part of the center. Hmm, interesting. So the circle is centered at (-3, √3) with radius √3. So the circle will touch the origin? Let me check.Wait, the distance from the center (-3, √3) to the origin (0,0) is sqrt[(-3 - 0)^2 + (√3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 3] = sqrt[12] = 2*sqrt(3). The radius is √3, which is half of that distance. So the circle doesn't reach the origin, but is halfway between the origin and the center? Wait, actually, the radius is √3, so the circle extends from the center (-3, √3) by √3 in all directions. So the closest point to the origin on this circle would be along the line connecting the origin to the center, right? But that might not be directly relevant here because we need the minimum argument.But the argument is about the angle, not the modulus. So even if the circle is close or far from the origin, the argument depends on the direction from the origin to the point. So points on the circle that are as far \\"south\\" as possible (i.e., with the smallest angle) would have the minimum argument. Wait, but the argument is measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis. So the smallest angle would correspond to the point on the circle that is closest to the positive real axis. But since the center is at (-3, √3), which is in the second quadrant, and the radius is √3, the circle might just touch the real axis? Let me check.The center is at (-3, √3). The real part is -3, so the x-coordinate is -3, and the y-coordinate is √3. The radius is √3. So moving down from the center by √3 in the y-direction would reach y = √3 - √3 = 0. So the circle touches the real axis at (-3, 0). But (-3, 0) is on the real axis, so that's the point z = -3. However, is this point on the circle? Let me verify. The distance from the center (-3, √3) to (-3, 0) is √[( -3 - (-3))² + (0 - √3)²] = √[0 + 3] = √3. Yes, so (-3, 0) is indeed on the circle. So the circle touches the real axis at (-3, 0). But (-3, 0) is on the negative real axis. So the argument of z = -3 is π, right? Because it's on the negative real axis. But we are looking for the minimum value of arg z. So if there are points on the circle that are closer to the positive real axis, their arguments would be smaller. But the circle is centered at (-3, √3), radius √3, so does any part of the circle extend into the right half-plane (where Re(z) > 0)? Probably not, because the center is at (-3, √3), and the radius is √3 ≈ 1.732, which is less than 3. So the entire circle is in the left half-plane (Re(z) < 0). Therefore, all points z on this circle have negative real parts. Therefore, their arguments are between π/2 and 3π/2 (i.e., in the left half of the complex plane). But the options given are all between π/6 and 5π/6, which are all less than π. Wait, that's confusing. The options are A. π/6, B. π/3, C. 2π/3, D. 5π/6. So all the options are between 0 and π. But if all the points on the circle are in the left half-plane, then their arguments should be between π/2 and 3π/2. So why are the answer choices all less than π? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, let's double-check. The center is (-3, √3). So in the complex plane, that's 3 units to the left on the real axis and √3 up on the imaginary axis. The radius is √3, which is about 1.732. So, if we move from the center towards the origin, the distance is 2√3 as calculated before, which is about 3.464. Since the radius is only √3, the circle doesn't reach the origin. But maybe it reaches into the second quadrant and maybe the lower part of the circle has a smaller argument? Wait, the argument is measured from the positive real axis, going counterclockwise. So a point in the second quadrant (Re(z) < 0, Im(z) > 0) has an argument between π/2 and π. A point in the third quadrant (Re(z) < 0, Im(z) < 0) has an argument between π and 3π/2. But since the center is at (-3, √3), and the radius is √3, the circle might extend below the real axis? Let's see.The center is at (-3, √3), so moving down by √3 units in the imaginary direction would reach ( -3, √3 - √3 ) = (-3, 0), which we already saw is on the circle. Moving up would reach (-3, 2√3). Moving left would go to (-3 - √3, √3), but since √3 is about 1.732, that would be (-4.732, 1.732). Moving right would be (-3 + √3, √3) ≈ (-1.268, 1.732). So all points on the circle are in the left half-plane (since the most rightward point is still at real part ≈ -1.268, which is still left of the imaginary axis). Therefore, all points z on this circle have Re(z) < 0, so their arguments are between π/2 (for points near the imaginary axis with positive imaginary part) and 3π/2 (for points near the imaginary axis with negative imaginary part). But the answer choices are all between π/6 and 5π/6. This is confusing. Maybe I need to check my reasoning again.Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the left half-plane? Wait, the center is at (-3, √3). Let me verify again. The equation is |z + 3 - √3 i| = √3. So z is such that when you add 3 - √3 i, the modulus is √3. So, equivalently, z = (a point on the circle centered at (-3, √3) with radius √3) minus (3 - √3 i). Wait, no, that's not. Wait, the equation is |z - (-3 + √3 i)| = √3. So z is a point on the circle with center at (-3, √3) and radius √3. So all the points z on this circle are of the form (-3, √3) plus a vector of length √3 in some direction. So indeed, all points z have coordinates (-3 + √3 cos θ, √3 + √3 sin θ), where θ is the angle parameter. Therefore, the real part is -3 + √3 cos θ, which is always less than -3 + √3 ≈ -3 + 1.732 ≈ -1.268, which is still negative. So all points z on the circle have negative real parts. Therefore, their arguments are between π/2 and 3π/2. But the answer choices are up to 5π/6, which is less than π. So something is wrong here.Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \\"If the complex number z satisfies |z + 3 - √3 i| = √3, then the minimum value of arg z is...\\" So according to this, the equation is |z - (-3 + √3 i)| = √3. So yes, the circle is centered at (-3, √3), radius √3. So the points on this circle have arguments as I thought. So why are the answer choices all less than π? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the principal value of the argument, which is usually between -π and π. But even so, points in the third quadrant would have arguments between -π and -π/2, but if we take the principal value as between 0 and 2π, then it's π to 3π/2. But the options given are all positive angles between π/6 and 5π/6, so maybe the question is expecting the answer in a specific range? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the tangent lines from the origin to the circle. The argument of z is the angle between the positive real axis and the line from the origin to the point z. So to find the minimum value of arg z, we need to find the point z on the circle where this angle is smallest. Since all z are in the left half-plane, the smallest angle would be when z is as close as possible to the positive real axis, but still in the left half-plane. So the point where the circle is tangent to a line from the origin making the smallest angle with the positive real axis.So, to find the minimum argument, we can consider the tangent lines from the origin to the circle. The points of tangency will give the minimum and maximum arguments. Let's try that approach.To find the tangent from the origin to the circle, we can use the formula for the tangent lines from a point to a circle. The circle has center (h, k) = (-3, √3) and radius r = √3. The point is (0, 0). The tangent lines from (0,0) to the circle will touch the circle at some points, and the arguments of these tangent points will give the minimum and maximum arguments.The formula for the tangent lines from an external point (x0, y0) to a circle (h - x)^2 + (k - y)^2 = r^2 is:First, the distance from the external point to the center is D = sqrt[(h - x0)^2 + (k - y0)^2]. In this case, D = sqrt[(-3 - 0)^2 + (√3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 3] = sqrt[12] = 2*sqrt(3). The radius is sqrt(3), so since D > r, the point is outside the circle, which means there are two tangent lines.The angle θ between the line connecting the external point to the center and the tangent lines can be found using sin θ = r / D = sqrt(3) / (2 sqrt(3)) ) = 1/2. So θ = π/6. Therefore, the angle between the line from origin to center and each tangent line is π/6. So the direction from the origin to the center is given by the angle φ = arctan(k / h). Wait, but h is negative here. The center is at (-3, √3), so the angle φ is in the second quadrant. Let's compute φ. The coordinates are (-3, √3), so the angle from the positive real axis to the line connecting the origin to the center is π - arctan(√3 / 3). Since √3 / 3 is 1/√3, so arctan(1/√3) = π/6. Therefore, φ = π - π/6 = 5π/6. Therefore, the two tangent lines make angles of φ ± θ = 5π/6 ± π/6. So the two angles are 5π/6 + π/6 = 6π/6 = π, and 5π/6 - π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3. Wait, but π is the angle pointing to the left along the real axis, but the tangent line at angle π would just be the point (-3, 0) which we already saw is on the circle, but arg z there is π. However, the other tangent line is at 2π/3. Wait, but 2π/3 is 120 degrees, which is in the second quadrant. So the tangent points are at angles π and 2π/3? But π is a real axis point, which is (-3, 0), but the other tangent point is at angle 2π/3.Wait, but how can the tangent lines be at angles π and 2π/3? Let me visualize this. The line from the origin to the center is at 5π/6. The angle between this line and each tangent is π/6. So one tangent is at 5π/6 - π/6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3, and the other is at 5π/6 + π/6 = π. But the tangent at angle π is the point (-3, 0), which is on the real axis, as we saw earlier. The other tangent at 2π/3 is a line in the second quadrant. But wait, 2π/3 is 120 degrees, so that line would go from the origin into the second quadrant at 120 degrees. The point of tangency on the circle would be where this line touches the circle. So that point would have argument 2π/3, which is one of the answer choices (option C). But the question asks for the minimum value of arg z. So if arg z can be as low as 2π/3, then 2π/3 would be the minimum. But is that correct?Wait, let's verify. If the tangent line at angle 2π/3 touches the circle, then the point of tangency would be the point on the circle with argument 2π/3. But does that point exist? Let's find the coordinates of the tangent points.Alternatively, we can parametrize the tangent lines. The tangent lines from (0,0) to the circle centered at (-3, √3) with radius √3. The equations of these tangent lines can be found using the formula for tangent lines from a point to a circle.The general formula for the tangent lines from (x0, y0) to the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is:(x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r^2 + [(x0 - h)(x0 - h) + (y0 - k)(y0 - k) - r^2]^{1/2} * ?Wait, maybe another approach. Let's use parametric equations.Let me denote the tangent line from (0,0) to the circle. Let the tangent point on the circle be (x, y). Then, the vector from (0,0) to (x, y) is (x, y), and the vector from (x, y) to the center (-3, √3) is (-3 - x, √3 - y). Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency, the vectors (x, y) and (-3 - x, √3 - y) should be perpendicular. Therefore, their dot product is zero:x*(-3 - x) + y*(√3 - y) = 0=> -3x - x² + √3 y - y² = 0Also, since the point (x, y) is on the circle:(x + 3)^2 + (y - √3)^2 = (√3)^2 = 3Expanding that:x² + 6x + 9 + y² - 2√3 y + 3 = 3Simplify:x² + 6x + 9 + y² - 2√3 y + 3 - 3 = 0=> x² + 6x + y² - 2√3 y + 9 = 0Now, from the previous equation, we have -3x - x² + √3 y - y² = 0, which can be rewritten as:x² + y² + 3x - √3 y = 0So we have two equations:1) x² + y² + 3x - √3 y = 02) x² + 6x + y² - 2√3 y + 9 = 0Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:(x² + 6x + y² - 2√3 y + 9) - (x² + y² + 3x - √3 y) = 0 - 0Simplify:6x - 3x + (-2√3 y - (-√3 y)) + 9 = 0=> 3x - √3 y + 9 = 0So 3x - √3 y = -9Let me solve for y:√3 y = 3x + 9=> y = (3x + 9)/√3 = √3 x + 3√3So y = √3 x + 3√3Now, substitute this into equation 1:x² + y² + 3x - √3 y = 0Plugging y = √3 x + 3√3:x² + ( √3 x + 3√3 )² + 3x - √3*(√3 x + 3√3 ) = 0First, compute (√3 x + 3√3 )²:= (√3 x)^2 + 2*(√3 x)*(3√3 ) + (3√3 )^2= 3x² + 2*(3*3)x + 9*3= 3x² + 18x + 27Next, compute √3*(√3 x + 3√3 ):= 3x + 9So equation becomes:x² + [3x² + 18x + 27] + 3x - [3x + 9] = 0Simplify:x² + 3x² + 18x + 27 + 3x - 3x - 9 = 0Combine like terms:(1x² + 3x²) + (18x + 3x - 3x) + (27 - 9) = 0= 4x² + 18x + 18 = 0Divide by 2:2x² + 9x + 9 = 0Solve for x:x = [-9 ± sqrt(81 - 72)] / 4= [-9 ± sqrt(9)] / 4= [-9 ± 3] / 4So two solutions:x = (-9 + 3)/4 = (-6)/4 = -3/2x = (-9 - 3)/4 = (-12)/4 = -3So when x = -3/2, y = √3*(-3/2) + 3√3 = (-3√3/2) + 3√3 = ( -3√3/2 + 6√3/2 ) = 3√3/2When x = -3, y = √3*(-3) + 3√3 = -3√3 + 3√3 = 0So the tangent points are at (-3/2, 3√3/2) and (-3, 0). Wait, we already knew (-3, 0) is on the circle. The other tangent point is at (-3/2, 3√3/2). Let me check the argument of this point.The coordinates are (-3/2, 3√3/2). So in the complex plane, this is z = -3/2 + (3√3/2)i. To find arg z, we can compute the angle θ such that tan θ = (3√3/2) / (-3/2) = -√3. But since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, it's in the second quadrant. The reference angle is arctan(√3) = π/3, so the argument is π - π/3 = 2π/3. Therefore, arg z = 2π/3. The other tangent point is (-3, 0), which has argument π. So the two tangent points have arguments 2π/3 and π. Therefore, the minimum value of arg z is 2π/3, which is option C. But let me verify if there are other points on the circle with smaller arguments. Suppose we take a point on the circle in the second quadrant, but closer to the imaginary axis. Would its argument be smaller than 2π/3? For example, consider the highest point on the circle. The center is (-3, √3), and radius √3, so the highest point is (-3, √3 + √3) = (-3, 2√3). The argument of this point is arctan(2√3 / (-3)) but again, since it's in the second quadrant, the argument is π - arctan(2√3 / 3). Let's compute that.tan(theta) = (2√3)/3 ≈ (3.464)/3 ≈ 1.1547, which is tan(49.1 degrees). So the argument is pi - 49.1 degrees ≈ 130.9 degrees, which is 2.284 radians. 2π/3 is approximately 120 degrees or 2.094 radians. So this point has a larger argument than 2π/3.Alternatively, the leftmost point on the circle is (-3 - √3, √3), which is (-3 - 1.732, 1.732) ≈ (-4.732, 1.732). The argument here is arctan(1.732 / -4.732), but since it's in the second quadrant, it's pi - arctan(1.732 / 4.732). Let me compute that. 1.732/4.732 ≈ 0.366, arctan(0.366) ≈ 20 degrees. So the argument is pi - 20 degrees ≈ 160 degrees, which is about 2.792 radians, which is larger than 2π/3.The rightmost point on the circle is (-3 + √3, √3) ≈ (-1.268, 1.732). The argument here is arctan(1.732 / -1.268). Since it's in the second quadrant, the argument is pi - arctan(1.732 / 1.268). Compute 1.732 / 1.268 ≈ 1.366, arctan(1.366) ≈ 53.8 degrees, so the argument is pi - 53.8 degrees ≈ 126.2 degrees, which is about 2.199 radians, still larger than 2π/3.So indeed, the point (-3/2, 3√3/2) with argument 2π/3 is the point on the circle with the smallest argument. Therefore, the minimum value of arg z is 2π/3, which is option C. Therefore, the answer is C.Final Answerboxed{C}</think>Given the complex number ( z ) satisfies ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ), we need to find the minimum value of ( arg z ).1. Identify the circle: The equation ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ) represents a circle centered at ( (-3, sqrt{3}) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ).2. Geometric interpretation: The center of the circle is ( (-3, sqrt{3}) ), and the radius is ( sqrt{3} ). All points ( z ) on this circle are in the left half-plane (Re(z) < 0), so their arguments are between ( frac{pi}{2} ) and ( frac{3pi}{2} ).3. Tangent lines from the origin: To find the minimum argument, consider the tangent lines from the origin to the circle. The distance from the origin to the center of the circle is ( sqrt{(-3)^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = 2sqrt{3} ). The radius is ( sqrt{3} ), so the angle ( theta ) between the line from the origin to the center and the tangent lines is ( arcsinleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}}right) = frac{pi}{6} ).4. Calculate the angles: The line from the origin to the center makes an angle ( phi = pi - arctanleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}right) = frac{5pi}{6} ). The tangent angles are ( frac{5pi}{6} pm frac{pi}{6} ), resulting in ( pi ) and ( frac{2pi}{3} ).5. Verify the tangent points: The tangent points are calculated to be ((-3, 0)) and (left(-frac{3}{2}, frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}right)). The argument of (left(-frac{3}{2}, frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}right)) is ( frac{2pi}{3} ), which is the minimum argument.Thus, the minimum value of ( arg z ) is (boxed{C}).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem here about complex numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is: If the complex number ( z ) satisfies ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ), then what is the minimum value of ( arg z )? The options are given as fractions of pi, so the answer is likely one of those common angles.First, let me recall what this notation means. The expression ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ) is the equation of a circle in the complex plane. In general, ( |z - a| = r ) represents a circle centered at the complex number ( a ) with radius ( r ). So in this case, comparing to the standard form, our equation can be rewritten as ( |z - (-3 + sqrt{3}i)| = sqrt{3} ). That means the circle is centered at ( (-3, sqrt{3}) ) in the complex plane (since complex numbers can be represented as points ( (x, y) ) where ( z = x + yi )), and the radius is ( sqrt{3} ).So, the problem is asking for the minimum argument (angle) of the complex number ( z ) that lies on this circle. The argument of a complex number ( z = x + yi ) is the angle it makes with the positive real axis, measured counterclockwise. The minimum value of ( arg z ) would correspond to the point on the circle that has the smallest angle with the positive real axis.To visualize this, I should probably sketch the complex plane. Let me imagine or draw it mentally. The center of the circle is at ( (-3, sqrt{3}) ), which is in the second quadrant because the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive. The radius is ( sqrt{3} ), which is approximately 1.732. The circle is centered at (-3, sqrt(3)) with radius sqrt(3). So, the circle is located in the second and maybe third quadrants? Wait, the center is at (-3, sqrt(3)), so moving left 3 units and up sqrt(3) units. The radius is sqrt(3), so from the center, the circle extends sqrt(3) in all directions.Since sqrt(3) is about 1.732, the circle will extend from -3 - sqrt(3) to -3 + sqrt(3) on the real axis, and from sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) to sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) on the imaginary axis. Wait, that can't be right. Let's see: the real part of the center is -3, and the radius is sqrt(3), so the leftmost point on the circle would be at -3 - sqrt(3) on the real axis, and the rightmost point would be at -3 + sqrt(3). Similarly, the imaginary part of the center is sqrt(3), so the highest point on the circle would be sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3), and the lowest point would be sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) = 0. Wait, so the circle touches the imaginary axis at 0? Because the center is at ( -3, sqrt(3) ), radius sqrt(3). So, moving down sqrt(3) from the center's imaginary part, sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) = 0. Therefore, the circle touches the origin? Wait, is that correct?Wait, let's verify. The distance from the center (-3, sqrt(3)) to the origin (0,0) is sqrt[ (-3 - 0)^2 + (sqrt(3) - 0)^2 ] = sqrt[9 + 3] = sqrt[12] = 2 sqrt(3). The radius of the circle is sqrt(3). Since the distance from the center to the origin is 2 sqrt(3), which is greater than the radius sqrt(3), the circle does not reach the origin. Therefore, the circle is entirely in the second quadrant and maybe part of the third? But since the imaginary part of the center is sqrt(3), and the radius is sqrt(3), the lowest point on the circle is sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) = 0. Wait, that's the imaginary part. So the point on the circle with the smallest imaginary part is ( -3, 0 ). Wait, but is that correct?Wait, the center is (-3, sqrt(3)), and the radius is sqrt(3). So, moving down sqrt(3) along the vertical axis from the center, we reach ( -3, sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) ) = ( -3, 0 ). So that point is on the circle. Similarly, moving up sqrt(3) would reach ( -3, 2 sqrt(3) ). So the circle goes from ( -3 - sqrt(3), sqrt(3) ) to ( -3 + sqrt(3), sqrt(3) ) on the horizontal line, but since the center is at (-3, sqrt(3)), moving left and right sqrt(3) in the real direction. But the circle also extends vertically from 0 to 2 sqrt(3) in the imaginary direction.Therefore, the circle is tangent to the real axis at ( -3, 0 ), since moving down sqrt(3) from the center in the imaginary direction gets to ( -3, 0 ). But since the radius is sqrt(3), that's exactly the distance. So the circle is tangent to the real axis at ( -3, 0 ). So that point is on the circle. Similarly, the circle extends left to -3 - sqrt(3) in the real direction and right to -3 + sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, the rightmost point is around -3 + 1.732 = -1.268, still negative. So the entire circle is in the second quadrant and maybe the third? But since the center is at (-3, sqrt(3)) and the radius is sqrt(3), the leftmost point is -3 - sqrt(3) (which is further left, so third quadrant) but the imaginary part is still sqrt(3). Wait, no, moving left and right only affects the real part. Moving up and down affects the imaginary part.Wait, actually, when moving in any direction from the center, the circle is all points at distance sqrt(3). So, the leftmost point is (-3 - sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), the rightmost is (-3 + sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), the topmost is (-3, sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)) = (-3, 2 sqrt(3)), and the bottommost is (-3, 0). So, the circle is tangent to the real axis at (-3, 0). So, the circle is entirely in the second quadrant except for the point (-3 - sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), which would be in the third quadrant since real part is less than -3 (negative) and imaginary part is positive. Wait, but sqrt(3) is positive, so the leftmost point (-3 - sqrt(3), sqrt(3)) is in the second quadrant as well? Wait, the imaginary part is positive, so even if the real part is more negative, it's still in the second quadrant. So, all points on the circle have positive imaginary parts except the point (-3, 0), which is on the real axis.But wait, moving down sqrt(3) from the center's imaginary coordinate, which is sqrt(3), you get to 0. So, only the point (-3, 0) is on the real axis, the rest have positive imaginary parts. So, the entire circle is in the second quadrant except that one point on the real axis. Wait, but if the real part is negative (since all points on the circle have real parts between -3 - sqrt(3) and -3 + sqrt(3), which is approximately between -4.732 and -1.268), all real parts are negative. So, all points on the circle are in the second quadrant (negative real, positive imaginary) except for the point (-3, 0), which is on the real axis (negative real, zero imaginary). So, the circle is in the second quadrant and tangent to the real axis at (-3, 0).Now, the question is to find the minimum value of arg z for z on this circle. The argument of a complex number is the angle from the positive real axis to the line connecting the origin to the point z, measured counterclockwise. Since all points z on the circle are in the second quadrant (or on the real axis), their arguments will be between pi/2 and pi (for second quadrant) or pi (for the real axis point). Wait, but (-3, 0) is on the negative real axis, so its argument is pi. But the problem is asking for the minimum value of arg z. Wait, but if arguments are measured from 0 to 2pi, then the minimum value would be the smallest angle in that range. However, depending on how the argument is defined, sometimes it's considered between -pi and pi, but in standard math terms, it's usually between 0 and 2pi. However, given the answer choices are all positive fractions of pi, so likely between 0 and 2pi.But since all the points on the circle have negative real parts and non-negative imaginary parts (except the tangent point), their arguments are between pi/2 and pi. The point (-3,0) has argument pi, which is the maximum in that range. So the minimum argument would be the smallest angle in (pi/2, pi). But how to find the point on the circle with the smallest argument?Alternatively, the argument is minimized when the angle is smallest, which would correspond to the point on the circle that is closest to the positive real axis. Since the positive real axis is the direction where the argument is 0. So, to find the point on the circle that is \\"closest\\" to the positive real axis in terms of angle. Wait, but the positive real axis is in the opposite direction from where the circle is located. The circle is in the second quadrant, so the closest point to the positive real axis would be the point on the circle that is furthest to the right (i.e., with the largest real part, closest to zero) and with the smallest positive imaginary part. Wait, but how does that affect the angle?Alternatively, maybe we can think geometrically. The argument of z is the angle theta such that tan(theta) = y/x, where z = x + yi. Since x is negative and y is positive (except at (-3,0)), theta is in the second quadrant. To minimize theta, we need the smallest angle in the second quadrant. That would correspond to the point where the line from the origin is tangent to the circle. Because the tangent line would have the smallest angle with the positive real axis before it no longer touches the circle.So, the idea is to find the tangent line from the origin to the circle, and the point of tangency will give the complex number z with the minimum argument.Alternatively, we can parametrize the circle and then find the minimum argument. Let me think.First, let's recall that the circle is centered at (-3, sqrt(3)) with radius sqrt(3). So, parametrizing the circle: any point z on the circle can be written as z = -3 + sqrt(3) i + sqrt(3) e^{i theta}, where theta ranges from 0 to 2pi. Then, z = (-3 + sqrt(3) cos theta) + (sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin theta) i. Then, the argument of z is arctan(y/x), where y = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin theta and x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta. But since x is negative and y is positive, the argument is pi - arctan(|y|/|x|). So, the argument is in the second quadrant.But to find the minimum argument, we need the minimum angle in the second quadrant. So, we need to minimize arctan(y/|x|). Wait, since x is negative, |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta (since x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, so |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta if cos theta is positive? Wait, no. Wait, x is -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, so |x| is | -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta |. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, since we need the point on the circle with the smallest argument, which is the angle from the positive real axis to the point z. The smaller the angle, the closer the line from the origin to z is to the positive real axis. So, geometrically, the tangent line from the origin to the circle will touch the circle at the point with the minimum argument. Similarly, another tangent line would touch at the point with the maximum argument.Therefore, if we can find the tangent lines from the origin to the circle, the points of tangency will give the minimum and maximum arguments. So, how do we find the tangent lines from a point to a circle?The formula for the tangent lines from a point (x0, y0) to a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:The equation of the tangent lines can be found by solving the system of equations given by the circle and the condition that the distance from (x0, y0) to the tangent line is equal to the radius. Alternatively, using geometry, the tangent lines will satisfy the condition that the distance from (x0, y0) to the center (h, k) squared is equal to the radius squared plus the square of the distance from (x0, y0) to the tangent line.Wait, maybe another approach. The line from the origin (0,0) to the point of tangency (x, y) on the circle must be perpendicular to the radius of the circle at that point. So, the radius from the center of the circle to the point (x, y) is in the direction from (-3, sqrt(3)) to (x, y). The line from the origin to (x, y) is the vector (x, y). These two vectors must be perpendicular.Wait, let me clarify. If we have a circle with center C and a point P on the circle, then the tangent at P is perpendicular to the radius CP. If we are drawing a tangent from an external point O to the circle, then the line OP is the tangent line, and OP is perpendicular to CP. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tangent line at P is perpendicular to CP, but the line from O to P is the tangent line. So, for the tangent from O to the circle, the line OP is tangent to the circle, and thus OP is perpendicular to CP. Therefore, the vectors OP and CP must be perpendicular.So, if O is the origin (0,0), and C is (-3, sqrt(3)), and P is (x, y) on the circle, then OP is the vector (x, y), and CP is the vector (x + 3, y - sqrt(3)). For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:( x(x + 3) + y(y - sqrt{3}) = 0 )Additionally, since P lies on the circle, it must satisfy the circle equation:( (x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )So, we have two equations:1. ( x(x + 3) + y(y - sqrt{3}) = 0 )2. ( (x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )Let me try to solve these equations.First, expand the first equation:( x^2 + 3x + y^2 - sqrt{3} y = 0 )The second equation is:( (x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )Expanding this:( x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 2sqrt{3} y + 3 = 3 )Simplify:( x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2 - 2sqrt{3} y + 3 = 3 )Combine like terms:( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 2sqrt{3} y + 12 = 3 )Subtract 3 from both sides:( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 2sqrt{3} y + 9 = 0 )Now, compare this with the first equation. Let's write both equations:1. ( x^2 + 3x + y^2 - sqrt{3} y = 0 )2. ( x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 2sqrt{3} y + 9 = 0 )Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:(Equation 2) - (Equation 1):( (x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 2sqrt{3} y + 9) - (x^2 + y^2 + 3x - sqrt{3} y) = 0 - 0 )Simplify:( 6x - 2sqrt{3} y + 9 - 3x + sqrt{3} y = 0 )Combine like terms:( 3x - sqrt{3} y + 9 = 0 )So:( 3x - sqrt{3} y = -9 )Let me solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for y:( -sqrt{3} y = -9 - 3x )Multiply both sides by (-1):( sqrt{3} y = 9 + 3x )Divide both sides by sqrt(3):( y = (9 + 3x)/sqrt{3} = 3sqrt{3} + (3x)/sqrt{3} = 3sqrt{3} + x sqrt{3} )So, ( y = sqrt{3} (x + 3) )Now, substitute this expression for y into equation 1:( x^2 + 3x + y^2 - sqrt{3} y = 0 )Plugging y = sqrt(3)(x + 3):First, compute y^2:( y^2 = [sqrt{3}(x + 3)]^2 = 3(x + 3)^2 )Compute sqrt(3) y:( sqrt{3} y = sqrt{3} * sqrt{3} (x + 3) = 3(x + 3) )So, substituting into equation 1:( x^2 + 3x + 3(x + 3)^2 - 3(x + 3) = 0 )Let me expand this:First, expand (x + 3)^2:( (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 )So:( x^2 + 3x + 3(x^2 + 6x + 9) - 3x - 9 = 0 )Wait, hold on. Let's go step by step.Original expression after substitution:( x^2 + 3x + 3(x + 3)^2 - 3(x + 3) = 0 )First, expand 3(x + 3)^2:= 3(x^2 + 6x + 9) = 3x^2 + 18x + 27Then, expand -3(x + 3):= -3x -9So putting it all together:( x^2 + 3x + 3x^2 + 18x + 27 -3x -9 = 0 )Combine like terms:x^2 + 3x^3: That's 1x^2 + 3x^2 = 4x^23x + 18x -3x: 3x + 18x = 21x -3x = 18xConstants: 27 -9 = 18So, equation becomes:4x^2 + 18x + 18 = 0Divide all terms by 2:2x^2 + 9x + 9 = 0Let's solve this quadratic equation for x.Quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)Here, a = 2, b = 9, c = 9Discriminant: 9² - 4*2*9 = 81 - 72 = 9So, sqrt(9) = 3Thus, solutions:x = [-9 ± 3]/4So,x = (-9 + 3)/4 = (-6)/4 = -3/2orx = (-9 - 3)/4 = (-12)/4 = -3So, x = -3/2 or x = -3Now, let's find the corresponding y for each x.Recall that y = sqrt(3)(x + 3)For x = -3/2:y = sqrt(3)(-3/2 + 3) = sqrt(3)(3/2) = (3 sqrt(3))/2For x = -3:y = sqrt(3)(-3 + 3) = sqrt(3)(0) = 0So, the points of tangency are at (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2) and (-3, 0)But wait, the point (-3,0) is on the circle and is the same point we discussed earlier where the circle is tangent to the real axis. However, the line from the origin to (-3, 0) is along the negative real axis, which has an argument of pi. But the other point (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2) is in the second quadrant. Let me check if this point is the one with the smaller argument.Let's compute the arguments for both points.First, for (-3,0):arg z = pi (since it's on the negative real axis)For (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2):Compute the argument theta = arctan(y/x). But since x is negative and y is positive, the argument is pi - arctan(|y/x|)So, |y/x| = (3 sqrt(3)/2) / (3/2) = sqrt(3)Therefore, arctan(|y/x|) = arctan(sqrt(3)) = pi/3Therefore, the argument is pi - pi/3 = 2pi/3So, the two tangent points have arguments 2pi/3 and pi. Therefore, the minimum argument is 2pi/3 and the maximum is pi. But wait, the options given are pi/6, pi/3, 2pi/3, 5pi/6. So 2pi/3 is option C.But wait, hold on. Wait, 2pi/3 is 120 degrees, which is larger than pi/3 (60 degrees), but since we are in the second quadrant, the arguments are between pi/2 (90 degrees) and pi (180 degrees). So, the minimum argument in that interval would be the smallest angle greater than pi/2. However, according to our calculation, the tangent points are at 2pi/3 and pi. Therefore, 2pi/3 is the smaller one. But 2pi/3 is 120 degrees, which is more than pi/2 (90 degrees). Wait, maybe there is another point on the circle with a smaller argument?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because the tangent line from the origin might not reach the circle in the second quadrant. Wait, no, we have two tangent points: one at (-3, 0) which is on the real axis, and another at (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2). But let me check if this point is actually on the circle.Let's verify for (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2):Compute (x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt(3))^2:x = -3/2, so x + 3 = -3/2 + 3 = 3/2y = (3 sqrt(3))/2, so y - sqrt(3) = (3 sqrt(3))/2 - sqrt(3) = (3 sqrt(3) - 2 sqrt(3))/2 = sqrt(3)/2Therefore, (3/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 9/4 + 3/4 = 12/4 = 3, which is equal to the radius squared. So, yes, this point is on the circle.Similarly, the point (-3, 0):(x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt(3))^2 = (0)^2 + (- sqrt(3))^2 = 3, which is correct.So, these are both points on the circle.Therefore, the arguments are pi and 2pi/3. Therefore, the minimum value of arg z is 2pi/3, which is option C.But wait, the answer options include pi/6, pi/3, 2pi/3, 5pi/6. So 2pi/3 is an option, C. But let me think again. Is 2pi/3 the correct minimum?Wait, if we imagine the circle in the second quadrant, tangent to the real axis at (-3, 0), and the other tangent point at (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2). The line from the origin to (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2) is a tangent, and the argument here is 2pi/3. So, is there a point on the circle with a smaller argument than 2pi/3?Wait, for example, take a point on the circle closer to the positive real axis. But since the circle is in the second quadrant, the closest it can get to the positive real axis is where it is tangent to the line from the origin. Wait, but maybe there's another point where the argument is smaller?Wait, the argument is measured from the positive real axis. So, the smallest angle would correspond to the point on the circle that is \\"closest\\" to the positive real axis. But since the entire circle is in the second quadrant and the left half-plane (negative real part), the closest approach would indeed be along the tangent line from the origin. Because if you try to draw a line from the origin to the circle, the tangent points are the closest points on the circle to the origin in terms of angle. Wait, but distance and angle are different.Alternatively, perhaps there's a point on the circle with a smaller argument. Let's consider parametrizing the circle and then finding the minimum argument.Let me parametrize the circle as follows:Any point z on the circle can be written as z = (-3 + sqrt(3) cos theta) + (sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin theta)i, where theta is the parameter varying from 0 to 2pi.Therefore, the real part is x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos thetaThe imaginary part is y = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin thetaThe argument of z is phi = arctan(y / x), but since x is negative and y is positive, phi = pi - arctan(y / |x|)We need to find the minimum phi, which corresponds to the minimum pi - arctan(y / |x|), which is equivalent to maximizing arctan(y / |x|). Therefore, the minimum phi occurs when y / |x| is maximized.So, we need to maximize y / |x|, where y = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin theta and |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta (since x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, so |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta because cos theta can be positive or negative, but since we have modulus, it's 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta if cos theta is positive, but actually, no. Wait, x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, so |x| = | -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta |. So, depending on the value of cos theta, this can be 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta if cos theta is positive or 3 + sqrt(3) |cos theta| if cos theta is negative. Wait, maybe not. Let me compute |x|.|x| = | -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta |. Let's denote that as | -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta |. Since sqrt(3) is about 1.732, and cos theta ranges from -1 to 1, so sqrt(3) cos theta ranges from -sqrt(3) to sqrt(3). Therefore, -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta ranges from -3 - sqrt(3) to -3 + sqrt(3). But since the circle is centered at (-3, sqrt(3)) with radius sqrt(3), as we discussed earlier, the real part x ranges from -3 - sqrt(3) to -3 + sqrt(3). However, we are taking the absolute value of x, but x is always negative (since -3 - sqrt(3) is about -4.732 and -3 + sqrt(3) is about -1.268). Therefore, |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta, because x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, so |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta.Wait, let me check:If x = -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta, then |x| = | -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta |. Since -3 + sqrt(3) cos theta is always negative? Let's see. sqrt(3) cos theta can be at maximum sqrt(3)*1 ≈ 1.732. So, -3 + 1.732 ≈ -1.268, which is still negative. The minimum value of sqrt(3) cos theta is -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732, so x can be as low as -3 -1.732 ≈ -4.732. So, in any case, x is negative, so |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta.Therefore, |x| = 3 - sqrt(3) cos theta.Therefore, y / |x| = [sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) sin theta] / [3 - sqrt(3) cos theta]Let me factor sqrt(3) in numerator and denominator:= [sqrt(3)(1 + sin theta)] / [3 - sqrt(3) cos theta]Let me rationalize this expression or perhaps simplify.Let me denote A = theta, so we can write:= sqrt(3)(1 + sin A) / (3 - sqrt(3) cos A)To maximize this ratio, we can use calculus. Let's set f(theta) = [sqrt(3)(1 + sin theta)] / [3 - sqrt(3) cos theta]. Find theta that maximizes f(theta).Alternatively, we can consider this as an optimization problem with trigonometric functions. Let me set t = theta for simplicity.f(t) = [sqrt(3)(1 + sin t)] / [3 - sqrt(3) cos t]Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1/sqrt(3) to simplify:f(t) = [1 + sin t] / [3/sqrt(3) - cos t] = [1 + sin t]/[sqrt(3) - cos t]So, f(t) = (1 + sin t)/(sqrt(3) - cos t)We need to find the maximum value of f(t). Let's compute derivative f’(t) and set it to zero.First, compute derivative using quotient rule:f’(t) = [ (cos t)(sqrt(3) - cos t) - (1 + sin t)(sin t) ] / (sqrt(3) - cos t)^2Set numerator equal to zero:cos t (sqrt(3) - cos t) - (1 + sin t) sin t = 0Expand the numerator:sqrt(3) cos t - cos^2 t - sin t - sin^2 t = 0Combine like terms:sqrt(3) cos t - (cos^2 t + sin^2 t) - sin t = 0Since cos^2 t + sin^2 t = 1:sqrt(3) cos t - 1 - sin t = 0So,sqrt(3) cos t - sin t = 1This is an equation of the form a cos t + b sin t = c. We can write this as:sqrt(3) cos t - sin t = 1Let me write this as R cos(t + phi) = 1, where R = sqrt( (sqrt(3))^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(3 + 1) = 2The angle phi is given by:cos phi = sqrt(3)/R = sqrt(3)/2sin phi = -(-1)/R = 1/2Therefore, phi = 30 degrees = pi/6Therefore,sqrt(3) cos t - sin t = 2 cos(t + pi/6) = 1Therefore,cos(t + pi/6) = 1/2Solutions are:t + pi/6 = pi/3 + 2kpi or t + pi/6 = -pi/3 + 2kpiThus,t = pi/3 - pi/6 + 2kpi = pi/6 + 2kpiort = -pi/3 - pi/6 + 2kpi = -pi/2 + 2kpiTherefore, the critical points are at t = pi/6 and t = -pi/2 (or 3pi/2) within [0, 2pi).Now, let's check these values.First, t = pi/6:Compute f(t):f(pi/6) = [1 + sin(pi/6)] / [sqrt(3) - cos(pi/6)]sin(pi/6) = 1/2, cos(pi/6) = sqrt(3)/2So,Numerator: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2Denominator: sqrt(3) - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2Thus, f(pi/6) = (3/2) / (sqrt(3)/2) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)Second, t = 3pi/2:f(3pi/2) = [1 + sin(3pi/2)] / [sqrt(3) - cos(3pi/2)]sin(3pi/2) = -1, cos(3pi/2) = 0Numerator: 1 + (-1) = 0Denominator: sqrt(3) - 0 = sqrt(3)Thus, f(3pi/2) = 0 / sqrt(3) = 0Therefore, the maximum occurs at t = pi/6, where f(t) = sqrt(3), and the minimum at t = 3pi/2, where f(t) = 0.But since we are maximizing f(t) to find the maximum y/|x|, which corresponds to the minimum argument phi = pi - arctan(y/|x|). The maximum value of y/|x| is sqrt(3), so the minimum argument is pi - arctan(sqrt(3)) = pi - pi/3 = 2pi/3.Therefore, the minimum value of arg z is 2pi/3, which is option C.Alternatively, this aligns with our previous result where the tangent point from the origin has argument 2pi/3.Therefore, the answer should be C, 2pi/3.But let me cross-verify once more. If we take the point (-3/2, (3 sqrt(3))/2), which we found earlier, and compute its argument:x = -3/2, y = (3 sqrt(3))/2tan(theta') = y / |x| = (3 sqrt(3)/2) / (3/2) = sqrt(3)So, theta' = arctan(sqrt(3)) = pi/3Therefore, the argument phi = pi - pi/3 = 2pi/3, which matches.Therefore, the minimum argument is indeed 2pi/3, option C.Final Answerboxed{C}</think>Given the complex number ( z ) satisfies ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ), we need to find the minimum value of ( arg z ).1. Understanding the Circle:   - The equation ( |z + 3 - sqrt{3}i| = sqrt{3} ) represents a circle centered at ( (-3, sqrt{3}) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ).   - The circle is in the second quadrant (negative real part, positive imaginary part) and tangent to the real axis at ( (-3, 0) ).2. Finding the Minimum Argument:   - The argument of a complex number ( z = x + yi ) is the angle from the positive real axis to the line connecting the origin to ( z ).   - The minimum argument corresponds to the point on the circle closest to the positive real axis, which is found by considering the tangent line from the origin to the circle.3. Geometric Approach:   - The tangent line from the origin to the circle will touch the circle at the point where the radius from the center to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.   - Solving the system of equations for the circle and the perpendicular condition, we find the points of tangency.4. Solving the Equations:   - The points of tangency are found by solving the system:     - ( x(x + 3) + y(y - sqrt{3}) = 0 )     - ( (x + 3)^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 )   - Solving these, we find the points ( (-3/2, (3sqrt{3}/2) ) and ( (-3, 0) ).5. Calculating the Arguments:   - For the point ( (-3/2, (3sqrt{3}/2) ):     - The argument is ( pi - arctanleft(frac{3sqrt{3}/2}{3/2}right) = pi - arctan(sqrt{3}) = pi - frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} ).   - For the point ( (-3, 0) ), the argument is ( pi ).6. Conclusion:   - The minimum argument is ( frac{2pi}{3} ).Thus, the minimum value of ( arg z ) is (boxed{C}).]"},{"problem":"Given that the vertex of the parabola C is at the origin, the focus is on the positive y-axis, and the line l: mx+y-frac{3}{2}=0 passes through the focus of the parabola C.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here.We have a parabola C with its vertex at the origin, and the focus is on the positive y-axis. So, the standard form of such a parabola would open upwards since the focus is on the positive y-axis. The line l is given by mx + y - 3/2 = 0, and it passes through the focus of the parabola. Part (1) asks for the equation of the parabola C. Let me recall that the standard equation of a parabola with vertex at the origin and opening upwards is x² = 4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Since the focus is on the positive y-axis, the coordinates of the focus would be (0, p). Now, the line l: mx + y - 3/2 = 0 passes through the focus (0, p). So, substituting x=0 and y=p into the line equation gives m*0 + p - 3/2 = 0, which simplifies to p = 3/2. Therefore, the value of p is 3/2. Substituting back into the standard equation of the parabola, x² = 4*(3/2)*y, which simplifies to x² = 6y. So, that should be the equation of the parabola C. Let me check if that makes sense. The focus would be at (0, 3/2), and substituting that into the line equation: m*0 + 3/2 - 3/2 = 0, which is true. So, part (1) seems done. The equation is x² = 6y.Now, part (2) is more complex. We need to find the minimum area of triangle ABP, where A and B are the intersection points of line l and parabola C, and P is the intersection of the tangents at A and B.First, let's find points A and B. The line l is mx + y = 3/2. We can express y from the line equation: y = (3/2) - mx. Substitute this into the parabola equation x² = 6y.Substituting y gives x² = 6*(3/2 - mx) => x² = 9 - 6mx => x² + 6mx - 9 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's write it as x² + 6mx - 9 = 0. The solutions to this equation are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's use the quadratic formula: x = [-6m ± sqrt((6m)² + 36)] / 2. Simplifying inside the square root: (36m² + 36) = 36(m² + 1). Therefore, sqrt(36(m² + 1)) = 6*sqrt(m² + 1). Therefore, x = [-6m ± 6√(m² +1)] / 2 = [-3m ± 3√(m² +1)]. So, the x-coordinates of A and B are -3m + 3√(m² +1) and -3m - 3√(m² +1). Let me denote these as x1 and x2.So, x1 = -3m + 3√(m² +1) and x2 = -3m - 3√(m² +1). Then, the corresponding y-coordinates can be found by plugging back into the line equation y = 3/2 - mx.For point A: y1 = 3/2 - m*x1 = 3/2 - m*(-3m + 3√(m² +1)) = 3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1).Similarly, for point B: y2 = 3/2 - m*x2 = 3/2 - m*(-3m - 3√(m² +1)) = 3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1).So, points A and B have coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).Next, we need to find the equations of the tangents to the parabola C at points A and B. Then find their intersection point P, and then compute the area of triangle ABP. Finally, find the minimum of this area with respect to m.First, let me recall that the equation of the tangent to the parabola x² = 6y at a point (x0, y0) on the parabola is given by xx0 = 3(y + y0). Wait, let me verify this. For a general parabola x² = 4py, the tangent at (x0, y0) is xx0 = 2p(y + y0). In our case, 4p = 6, so p = 3/2. Therefore, the tangent equation should be xx0 = 2*(3/2)*(y + y0) => xx0 = 3(y + y0). Yes, that's correct.Therefore, for point A (x1, y1), the tangent equation is x*x1 = 3(y + y1). Similarly, for point B (x2, y2), the tangent equation is x*x2 = 3(y + y2).We need to find the intersection point P of these two tangents. Let's solve the two equations:1) x*x1 = 3(y + y1)2) x*x2 = 3(y + y2)Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:x*x1 - x*x2 = 3(y + y1) - 3(y + y2) => x(x1 - x2) = 3(y1 - y2)Hence, x = [3(y1 - y2)] / (x1 - x2)Similarly, once x is found, we can substitute back into one of the equations to find y.Alternatively, maybe express both equations in terms of y and solve.From equation 1: y = (x*x1)/3 - y1From equation 2: y = (x*x2)/3 - y2Set them equal: (x*x1)/3 - y1 = (x*x2)/3 - y2 => x*(x1 - x2)/3 = y1 - y2 => x = [3(y1 - y2)] / (x1 - x2) as before.So, once x is found, substitute back to get y. Let me compute x1 - x2 and y1 - y2.First, x1 = -3m + 3√(m² +1), x2 = -3m - 3√(m² +1). Therefore, x1 - x2 = [ -3m + 3√(m² +1) ] - [ -3m - 3√(m² +1) ] = 6√(m² +1).Similarly, y1 - y2 = [ 3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1) ] - [ 3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) ] = -6m√(m² +1)Therefore, x = [3*( -6m√(m² +1) ) ] / [6√(m² +1) ] = [ -18m√(m² +1) ] / [6√(m² +1) ] = -3m.So, x coordinate of P is -3m.Then, substituting x = -3m into equation 1: (-3m)*x1 = 3(y + y1) => y = (-3m x1)/3 - y1 = -m x1 - y1.Compute y:First, x1 = -3m + 3√(m² +1). So, -m x1 = -m*(-3m + 3√(m² +1)) = 3m² - 3m√(m² +1).Then, y = 3m² - 3m√(m² +1) - y1. But y1 is 3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1). Therefore:y = 3m² - 3m√(m² +1) - [3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1)] = 3m² - 3m√(m² +1) - 3/2 - 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) = -3/2.Therefore, point P has coordinates ( -3m, -3/2 ).So, regardless of m, the y-coordinate of P is always -3/2, and the x-coordinate is -3m. Interesting.Now, we need to compute the area of triangle ABP.Points A, B, P. Let's note their coordinates.Point A: (x1, y1) = (-3m + 3√(m² +1), 3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1))Point B: (x2, y2) = (-3m - 3√(m² +1), 3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1))Point P: (-3m, -3/2)To find the area of triangle ABP, we can use the formula:Area = (1/2)| (x_A(y_B - y_P) + x_B(y_P - y_A) + x_P(y_A - y_B)) |Alternatively, since the coordinates might be complicated, maybe we can use vectors or determinants.Alternatively, we can parametrise the triangle and compute using coordinates.Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of all three points, we can use the shoelace formula.Let me recall the shoelace formula for three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):Area = (1/2)|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|So, plugging in the coordinates:x1 = -3m + 3√(m² +1), y1 = 3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1)x2 = -3m - 3√(m² +1), y2 = 3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)x3 = -3m, y3 = -3/2So, compute each term:First term: x1(y2 - y3) = [ -3m + 3√(m² +1) ] * [ (3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)) - (-3/2) ]Simplify inside the brackets:3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) + 3/2 = 3 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)Therefore, first term: [ -3m + 3√(m² +1) ] * [ 3 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) ]Similarly, second term: x2(y3 - y1) = [ -3m - 3√(m² +1) ] * [ -3/2 - (3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1)) ]Simplify inside the brackets:-3/2 - 3/2 - 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) = -3 - 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)Third term: x3(y1 - y2) = (-3m) * [ (3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1)) - (3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)) ]Simplify inside the brackets:(3/2 + 3m² - 3m√(m² +1)) - (3/2 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1)) = -6m√(m² +1)Therefore, third term: (-3m)*(-6m√(m² +1)) = 18m²√(m² +1)Now, let's compute each term step by step.First term:[ -3m + 3√(m² +1) ] * [ 3 + 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) ]Factor out 3 in the second bracket:3[1 + m² + m√(m² +1)]So, first term becomes:3[ -3m + 3√(m² +1) ] * [1 + m² + m√(m² +1)]Let me denote √(m² +1) as s for simplicity. Then s = √(m² +1). Then, s² = m² +1.So, substituting:First term: 3*(-3m + 3s)*(1 + m² + m s) = 3*3*(-m + s)*(1 + m² + m s) = 9*(-m + s)*(1 + m² + m s)Hmm, maybe expanding this:First, (-m + s)*(1 + m² + m s) = -m*(1 + m² + m s) + s*(1 + m² + m s)= -m - m³ - m² s + s + m² s + m s²Simplify terms:- m - m³ - m² s + s + m² s + m s²The -m² s and +m² s cancel.So, left with: -m - m³ + s + m s²But s² = m² +1, so m s² = m(m² +1) = m³ + mTherefore, substitute:- m - m³ + s + m³ + m = (-m + m) + (-m³ + m³) + s = 0 + 0 + s = sTherefore, first term: 9*s = 9√(m² +1)That's a nice simplification!Second term:[ -3m - 3√(m² +1) ] * [ -3 - 3m² + 3m√(m² +1) ]Factor out -3 from the first bracket and 3 from the second bracket:= (-3)(m + s) * 3(-1 - m² + m s) = -9(m + s)( -1 - m² + m s )Again, let's use s = √(m² +1)Compute (m + s)(-1 - m² + m s):First, expand (m + s)( -1 - m² + m s )= m*(-1 - m² + m s) + s*(-1 - m² + m s)= -m - m³ + m² s - s - m² s + m s²Simplify terms:- m - m³ + m² s - s - m² s + m s²Again, the +m² s and -m² s cancel.So, left with: -m - m³ - s + m s²Again, s² = m² +1, so m s² = m(m² +1) = m³ + mThus:- m - m³ - s + m³ + m = (-m + m) + (-m³ + m³) - s = 0 + 0 - s = -sTherefore, the entire second term: -9*(-s) = 9s = 9√(m² +1)Third term: 18m²√(m² +1)Therefore, putting it all together:Area = (1/2)| first term + second term + third term | = (1/2)|9√(m² +1) +9√(m² +1) +18m²√(m² +1)| = (1/2)| (18√(m² +1) +18m²√(m² +1)) |.Factor out 18√(m² +1):= (1/2)*18√(m² +1)*(1 + m²) = 9√(m² +1)*(1 + m²)But note that 1 + m² = s², where s = √(m² +1). So, 1 + m² = s² = (√(m² +1))² = m² +1.Therefore, the area becomes 9√(m² +1)*(m² +1) =9*(m² +1)^(3/2)But wait, let me check:Wait, s = √(m² +1), so s² = m² +1. Then, 1 + m² = s², so the expression is:9√(m² +1)*(1 + m²) =9*(s)*(s²) =9*s^3 =9*(m² +1)^(3/2). But hang on, the area formula via shoelace gives absolute value, but since all terms are positive (since m² +1 is always positive), the absolute value is redundant. So, Area =9*(m² +1)^(3/2)Wait, but this seems like the area is 9*(m² +1)^(3/2). However, this contradicts my earlier steps. Wait, let me check.Wait, first term was 9√(m² +1), second term 9√(m² +1), third term 18m²√(m² +1). So total inside the absolute value is 9s +9s +18m² s = (18 +18m²)s =18(1 +m²)s.But s=√(m² +1), so 18(1 +m²)√(m² +1) =18*(m² +1)^(3/2). Then multiply by (1/2):Area = (1/2)*18*(m² +1)^(3/2) =9*(m² +1)^(3/2). So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the area of triangle ABP is 9*(m² +1)^(3/2). Wait, but this seems a bit strange because as m varies, the area would vary. We need to find the minimum of this area.Wait, but if the area is 9*(m² +1)^(3/2), then to minimize this, we need to minimize (m² +1)^(3/2). Since (m² +1) is always at least 1, the minimum occurs when m² +1 is minimized, i.e., when m=0. Then, (0 +1)^(3/2)=1. Therefore, minimum area is 9*1=9. Therefore, the minimal area is 9.But wait, hold on. Let me verify again. If m=0, then the line l is 0*x + y - 3/2=0 => y=3/2. This is a horizontal line passing through the focus (0, 3/2). Then, the parabola is x²=6y. The intersection points A and B would be where y=3/2, so x²=6*(3/2)=9 => x=±3. So, points A=(3, 3/2) and B=(-3, 3/2). The tangents at these points.Equation of tangent at A: x*3=3(y + 3/2) => 3x=3y + 9/2 => x = y + 3/2.Similarly, tangent at B: x*(-3)=3(y + 3/2) => -3x=3y +9/2 => -x = y + 3/2 => y = -x -3/2.Intersection point P: solve x = y + 3/2 and y = -x -3/2.Substitute x from first equation into second: y = -(y + 3/2) -3/2 => y = -y -3/2 -3/2 => y = -y -3 => 2y = -3 => y = -3/2. Then x = (-3/2) + 3/2 =0. Wait, but according to our previous result, when m=0, point P is (-3m, -3/2) = (0, -3/2). So, that's correct. Points A=(3,3/2), B=(-3,3/2), P=(0,-3/2). The triangle ABP is a triangle with vertices at (3,3/2), (-3,3/2), and (0,-3/2). The base AB is the distance between (3,3/2) and (-3,3/2), which is 6. The height is the vertical distance from P to AB. Since AB is horizontal at y=3/2, the height is |3/2 - (-3/2)|=3. So, area is (1/2)*6*3=9, which matches our formula. Therefore, when m=0, the area is 9, and according to our formula, the area is 9*(m² +1)^(3/2), which is minimized at m=0.But wait, let me check for another value. Suppose m=1. Then, the area would be 9*(1 +1)^(3/2)=9*(2)^(3/2)=9*2*sqrt(2)=18*sqrt(2)≈25.45, which is larger than 9. Similarly, if m is negative, say m=-1, since m² is still 1, the area is the same. Therefore, the minimum area indeed occurs at m=0, giving area 9. Therefore, the answer to part (2) is 9.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the area expression.Wait, when we computed the three terms for the area using the shoelace formula:First term: 9√(m² +1)Second term:9√(m² +1)Third term:18m²√(m² +1)Total sum: 18√(m² +1) +18m²√(m² +1)=18(1 +m²)√(m² +1)=18(m² +1)^(3/2). Then multiply by 1/2: 9(m² +1)^(3/2). So that's correct.Thus, to minimize 9(m² +1)^(3/2), since (m² +1) >=1, the minimum occurs at m² +1=1, so m=0. Therefore, minimum area is 9*1=9. Hence, the answer is 9.But let me check with m approaching infinity. If m becomes very large, then (m² +1)^(3/2) ≈ m^3, so the area tends to infinity. So, indeed, the minimal area is at m=0.Therefore, the minimal area is 9. So, problem (2)'s answer is 9.But let me just think again: when m=0, the line l is horizontal, passing through the focus. The points A and B are symmetric about the y-axis, and the tangents at A and B meet at P on the y-axis below the vertex. The triangle ABP is an isosceles triangle with base AB and height from P to AB. Since AB is 6 units long and the height is 3 units, the area is indeed 9. That makes sense.Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct.Final Answer(1) The equation of the parabola C is boxed{x^2 = 6y}.  (2) The minimum area of triangle ABP is boxed{9}.</think>Given that the vertex of the parabola ( C ) is at the origin and the focus is on the positive ( y )-axis, the standard form of the parabola is ( x^2 = 4py ). The line ( l: mx + y - frac{3}{2} = 0 ) passes through the focus, which is at ( (0, p) ). Substituting the coordinates of the focus into the line equation gives ( p = frac{3}{2} ). Therefore, the equation of the parabola is ( x^2 = 6y ).For part (2), the line ( l ) intersects the parabola ( x^2 = 6y ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). Substituting ( y = frac{3}{2} - mx ) into the parabola's equation gives the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 6mx - 9 = 0 ). Solving this quadratic equation, the x-coordinates of ( A ) and ( B ) are found to be ( -3m + 3sqrt{m^2 + 1} ) and ( -3m - 3sqrt{m^2 + 1} ). The corresponding y-coordinates are calculated using the line equation.The tangents at points ( A ) and ( B ) are found using the tangent formula for the parabola ( x^2 = 6y ). These tangents intersect at point ( P ), which is determined to be ( (-3m, -frac{3}{2}) ).Using the shoelace formula to find the area of triangle ( ABP ), the coordinates of ( A ), ( B ), and ( P ) are substituted. After simplifying, the area is found to be ( 9(m^2 + 1)^{3/2} ). To minimize this area, we note that the expression ( (m^2 + 1)^{3/2} ) is minimized when ( m = 0 ), resulting in a minimum area of 9. Final Answer(1) The equation of the parabola ( C ) is (boxed{x^2 = 6y}).  (2) The minimum area of (triangle ABP) is (boxed{9}).,<think>Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out part (1), which is finding the equation of the parabola C. The problem states that the vertex is at the origin, the focus is on the positive y-axis, and the line l: mx + y - 3/2 = 0 passes through the focus. Since the vertex is at the origin and the focus is on the positive y-axis, I recall that the standard form of such a parabola is x² = 4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. So, the focus would be at (0, p). Now, the line l passes through the focus (0, p). Let's substitute the coordinates of the focus into the line equation to find p. Plugging x=0 and y=p into mx + y - 3/2 = 0 gives:m*0 + p - 3/2 = 0  So, p = 3/2.Therefore, the equation of the parabola should be x² = 4*(3/2)*y, which simplifies to x² = 6y. Let me double-check that. If p is 3/2, then 4p is 6, so yes, x² = 6y. That should be the answer for part (1).Moving on to part (2). We have the line l intersecting the parabola C at points A and B. Then, tangents to the parabola at A and B are drawn, and they intersect at point P. We need to find the minimum area of triangle ABP.First, let's find points A and B where the line l intersects the parabola. The line is given by mx + y = 3/2, so y = -mx + 3/2. Substitute this into the parabola equation x² = 6y:x² = 6*(-mx + 3/2)  x² = -6mx + 9  x² + 6mx - 9 = 0This is a quadratic in x. The solutions will give the x-coordinates of A and B. Let's denote the roots as x₁ and x₂. Then, using quadratic formula:x = [-6m ± sqrt((6m)^2 - 4*1*(-9))]/2  x = [-6m ± sqrt(36m² + 36)]/2  Factor out 36 under the square root:sqrt(36(m² + 1)) = 6sqrt(m² + 1)  Thus,x = [-6m ± 6sqrt(m² + 1)]/2  Simplify:x = -3m ± 3sqrt(m² + 1)So the x-coordinates of A and B are -3m + 3sqrt(m² +1) and -3m - 3sqrt(m² +1). Let's denote these as x₁ and x₂.Corresponding y-coordinates can be found by plugging back into y = -mx + 3/2. Let's compute y₁ and y₂:For x₁ = -3m + 3sqrt(m² +1):y₁ = -m*(-3m + 3sqrt(m² +1)) + 3/2  = 3m² - 3m sqrt(m² +1) + 3/2Similarly, for x₂ = -3m - 3sqrt(m² +1):y₂ = -m*(-3m - 3sqrt(m² +1)) + 3/2  = 3m² + 3m sqrt(m² +1) + 3/2So points A and B are (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂).Next, we need to find the equations of the tangents at A and B to the parabola C. The parabola is x² = 6y. The derivative dy/dx gives the slope of the tangent at any point (x, y) on the parabola. Differentiating both sides:2x = 6 dy/dx  dy/dx = x/3So the slope of the tangent at any point (x, y) is x/3. Therefore, the equation of the tangent at point (x₀, y₀) is:y - y₀ = (x₀/3)(x - x₀)But since (x₀, y₀) lies on the parabola, y₀ = x₀²/6. Substitute that in:y - x₀²/6 = (x₀/3)(x - x₀)  Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:6y - x₀² = 2x₀(x - x₀)  6y - x₀² = 2x₀x - 2x₀²  6y = 2x₀x - x₀²  Divide both sides by 2:3y = x₀x - (x₀²)/2Alternatively, another way to write the tangent line is using the formula for the tangent to a parabola x² = 4py, which is xx₁ = 2p(y + y₁). Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me check.For a parabola x² = 4py, the equation of the tangent at point (x₁, y₁) is xx₁ = 2p(y + y₁). In our case, the parabola is x² = 6y, so 4p = 6, so p = 3/2. Therefore, the tangent equation is xx₁ = 2*(3/2)(y + y₁) => xx₁ = 3(y + y₁). But since (x₁, y₁) is on the parabola, y₁ = x₁²/6. Therefore, the tangent equation becomes:x x₁ = 3(y + x₁²/6)  Simplify:x x₁ = 3y + x₁²/2  Bring all terms to one side:x x₁ - x₁²/2 - 3y = 0Alternatively, solving for y:3y = x x₁ - x₁²/2  y = (x x₁)/3 - x₁²/6This matches the previous result. So, the tangent line at (x₁, y₁) is y = (x x₁)/3 - x₁²/6.Similarly, the tangent line at (x₂, y₂) is y = (x x₂)/3 - x₂²/6.Point P is the intersection of these two tangents. Let's find the coordinates of P by solving these two equations.Set the two expressions for y equal:(x x₁)/3 - x₁²/6 = (x x₂)/3 - x₂²/6  Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate denominators:2x x₁ - x₁² = 2x x₂ - x₂²  Bring all terms to the left:2x x₁ - x₁² - 2x x₂ + x₂² = 0  Factor:2x(x₁ - x₂) - (x₁² - x₂²) = 0  Note that x₁² - x₂² = (x₁ - x₂)(x₁ + x₂), so:2x(x₁ - x₂) - (x₁ - x₂)(x₁ + x₂) = 0  Factor out (x₁ - x₂):(x₁ - x₂)(2x - (x₁ + x₂)) = 0Since x₁ ≠ x₂ (they are distinct intersection points), we can divide both sides by (x₁ - x₂):2x - (x₁ + x₂) = 0  Thus:x = (x₁ + x₂)/2So the x-coordinate of P is the average of x₁ and x₂. Then, substitute back into one of the tangent equations to find y-coordinate. Let's use the tangent at A:y = (x x₁)/3 - x₁²/6Plug x = (x₁ + x₂)/2:y = [( (x₁ + x₂)/2 ) * x₁]/3 - x₁²/6  = (x₁² + x₁ x₂)/6 - x₁²/6  = (x₁² + x₁ x₂ - x₁²)/6  = (x₁ x₂)/6Alternatively, using the tangent at B:y = (x x₂)/3 - x₂²/6  Plug x = (x₁ + x₂)/2:y = [( (x₁ + x₂)/2 ) * x₂]/3 - x₂²/6  = (x₁ x₂ + x₂²)/6 - x₂²/6  = x₁ x₂ /6So, the coordinates of P are ((x₁ + x₂)/2, x₁ x₂ /6).Therefore, we have coordinates for A, B, and P. Now, we need to find the area of triangle ABP and then minimize it with respect to m.First, let's recall that the area of a triangle given three points (x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂), (x₃,y₃) can be computed using the determinant formula:Area = |(x₁(y₂ - y₃) + x₂(y₃ - y₁) + x₃(y₁ - y₂))/2|Alternatively, using vectors or base-height. But maybe using coordinates is straightforward.Let me denote:A = (x₁, y₁)  B = (x₂, y₂)  P = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, x₁ x₂ /6)Let's compute the vectors AB and AP and use the cross product formula for area. Wait, but with three points, the area is 1/2 | (B - A) × (P - A) |.Yes, that's another way. Let's use that.First, compute vector AB = (x₂ - x₁, y₂ - y₁)  Vector AP = ((x₁ + x₂)/2 - x₁, x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁)  Simplify AP:= ( (x₂ - x₁)/2, x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁ )So the cross product (B - A) × (P - A) is:(x₂ - x₁)*(x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁) - (y₂ - y₁)*( (x₂ - x₁)/2 )Factor out (x₂ - x₁):= (x₂ - x₁)[ (x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁) - (y₂ - y₁)/2 ]Simplify inside the brackets:= (x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁) - (y₂ - y₁)/2  = x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁ - y₂ /2 + y₁/2  = x₁ x₂ /6 - y₁/2 - y₂ /2  = x₁ x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2Therefore, the cross product is (x₂ - x₁)[x₁ x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2]Thus, the area is 1/2 | (x₂ - x₁)[x₁ x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2 ] |  = 1/2 |x₂ - x₁| |x₁ x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2|So, let's compute each part.First, x₂ - x₁: from earlier, x₁ and x₂ are roots of x² +6mx -9=0, so x₁ + x₂ = -6m and x₁x₂ = -9. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the quadratic equation is x² +6mx -9 =0, so sum of roots is -6m, product is -9. So x₁ + x₂ = -6m, x₁x₂ = -9.So, x₂ - x₁. Let's compute (x₂ - x₁)² = (x₁ + x₂)² -4x₁x₂ = (-6m)^2 -4*(-9) = 36m² +36 = 36(m² +1). Therefore, |x₂ - x₁| = 6sqrt(m² +1). Since x₂ < x₁ or x₁ < x₂ depending on m, but since we take absolute value, it's 6sqrt(m² +1).Next, compute x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2. Let's compute each term.We already know x₁x₂ = -9, so x₁x₂ /6 = -9/6 = -3/2.Now, compute y₁ + y₂. From earlier, points A and B have coordinates (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) where y = -mx +3/2. So y₁ + y₂ = (-mx₁ + 3/2) + (-mx₂ +3/2) = -m(x₁ +x₂) + 3.But x₁ +x₂ = -6m, so:y₁ + y₂ = -m*(-6m) +3 = 6m² +3.Therefore, (y₁ + y₂)/2 = (6m² +3)/2 = 3m² + 3/2.So, x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2 = (-3/2) - (3m² + 3/2) = -3/2 -3m² -3/2 = -3m² -3.Therefore, the cross product term is (x₂ -x₁)[x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2] = 6sqrt(m² +1) * (-3m² -3) = -6sqrt(m² +1)*3(m² +1) = -18(m² +1)^(3/2)Taking absolute value, we get 18(m² +1)^(3/2). Then the area is 1/2 * 18(m² +1)^(3/2) = 9(m² +1)^(3/2)Therefore, the area of triangle ABP is 9(m² +1)^(3/2). Wait, but that seems like the area is a function of m, and we need to find its minimum.Wait, but this seems counterintuitive. The problem states \\"find the minimum area of triangle ABP\\". But according to this, the area is 9(m² +1)^(3/2), which increases as |m| increases. Therefore, the minimum occurs when m² is minimized, i.e., when m=0.But let me verify this calculation step by step because this result seems a bit odd. Let's check:We have area = 9(m² +1)^(3/2). To find the minimum, we can take derivative with respect to m, set to zero.But if m=0 gives the minimum, that would correspond to the line l being horizontal (since m=0, the line is y=3/2). But the focus is at (0, 3/2), so this line passes through the focus, as given. Then, intersecting the parabola x²=6y with y=3/2 gives x²=6*(3/2)=9, so x=±3. So points A and B are (3, 3/2) and (-3, 3/2). Then, the tangents at these points: For (3, 3/2), the tangent is x*3 = 3(y + 3/2) => 3x = 3y + 9/2 => x = y + 3/2. Similarly, tangent at (-3, 3/2) is x*(-3) = 3(y + 3/2) => -3x = 3y + 9/2 => -x = y + 3/2 => y = -x - 3/2.Intersection point P: solve x = y + 3/2 and y = -x - 3/2.Substitute first into second: y = -(y + 3/2) -3/2 => y = -y -3/2 -3/2 => y = -y -3 => 2y = -3 => y = -3/2. Then x = (-3/2) +3/2 =0. So P is (0, -3/2).Then, triangle ABP has vertices at (3, 3/2), (-3, 3/2), and (0, -3/2). The base AB is from (-3, 3/2) to (3, 3/2), length 6. The height is the vertical distance from P to AB, which is 3/2 - (-3/2) = 3. So area is (6 *3)/2=9. According to our formula, when m=0, area is 9*(0 +1)^(3/2)=9*1=9. So that's correct.But if m increases, say m=1, area is 9*(1+1)^(3/2)=9*(2)^(3/2)=9*2.828≈25.45, which is larger. So indeed, the minimum area is 9 when m=0. Therefore, the minimum area is 9.But wait, is that possible? Let me think again. The problem says \\"find the minimum area of triangle ABP\\". If when m=0, the area is 9, and when m≠0, area is larger, then the minimum is indeed 9.But let me verify if there's any mistake in the calculation. Let's go back.We found that the area is 9(m² +1)^(3/2). Since (m² +1) is always greater or equal to 1, the minimal value is achieved when m²=0, i.e., m=0, leading to area=9*1=9. Therefore, the minimal area is 9.But let me check another way. Suppose m approaches infinity. Then, the line l: mx + y =3/2 becomes almost vertical, intersecting the parabola at points approaching (0, 3/2). But as m increases, the points A and B get closer to the focus, and the tangents at those points... Hmm, maybe the area actually increases as |m| increases, which matches our formula.Therefore, the minimal area is 9. Therefore, part (2)'s answer is 9.But let me double-check the area formula.We had:Area = 1/2 |x₂ -x₁| |x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2|Computed |x₂ -x₁|=6sqrt(m² +1)Then, x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2 = -3/2 - (3m² +3/2) = -3m² -3Therefore, |x₁x₂ /6 - (y₁ + y₂)/2| = | -3(m² +1) | =3(m² +1)Thus, Area =1/2 *6sqrt(m² +1)*3(m² +1) = (1/2)*18(m² +1)^(3/2)=9(m² +1)^(3/2)Yes, that's correct. Therefore, Area =9(m² +1)^(3/2). To minimize this, take derivative with respect to m:dA/dm =9*(3/2)*(m² +1)^(1/2)*2m =27m*(m² +1)^(1/2)Set derivative to zero:27m*(m² +1)^(1/2)=0The solutions are m=0 (since (m² +1)^(1/2) is always positive). Therefore, critical point at m=0. Second derivative test: For m>0, dA/dm >0; for m<0, dA/dm <0. Wait, but since the function is even in m (since it depends on m²), the derivative at m=0- is negative and m=0+ is positive, so m=0 is a minimum.Therefore, the minimal area is at m=0, giving Area=9*1=9.Therefore, the answers are:(1) x²=6y(2) Minimum area is 9.Final Answer(1) The equation of the parabola C is boxed{x^2 = 6y}.(2) The minimum area of triangle ABP is boxed{9}.</think>Given that the vertex of the parabola ( C ) is at the origin, the focus is on the positive ( y )-axis, and the line ( l: mx + y - frac{3}{2} = 0 ) passes through the focus of the parabola ( C ):(1) The standard form of the parabola with vertex at the origin and focus on the positive ( y )-axis is ( x^2 = 4py ). The line ( l ) passes through the focus ((0, p)). Substituting ( x = 0 ) and ( y = p ) into the line equation gives ( p = frac{3}{2} ). Therefore, the equation of the parabola is ( x^2 = 6y ).(2) The line ( l ) intersects the parabola ( x^2 = 6y ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). Substituting ( y = -mx + frac{3}{2} ) into the parabola equation gives the quadratic ( x^2 + 6mx - 9 = 0 ). The roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are found using the quadratic formula, giving ( x_1 = -3m + 3sqrt{m^2 + 1} ) and ( x_2 = -3m - 3sqrt{m^2 + 1} ). The corresponding ( y )-coordinates are ( y_1 = 3m^2 - 3msqrt{m^2 + 1} + frac{3}{2} ) and ( y_2 = 3m^2 + 3msqrt{m^2 + 1} + frac{3}{2} ).The tangents at ( A ) and ( B ) intersect at point ( P ). The coordinates of ( P ) are found to be (left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{x_1 x_2}{6} right) ). Substituting ( x_1 + x_2 = -6m ) and ( x_1 x_2 = -9 ), the coordinates of ( P ) simplify to (left( -3m, -frac{3}{2} right) ).The area of triangle ( ABP ) is calculated using the determinant formula, leading to the expression ( 9(m^2 + 1)^{3/2} ). To minimize this area, we find the critical points by differentiating with respect to ( m ), leading to ( m = 0 ). Substituting ( m = 0 ) gives the minimum area of 9. Final Answer(1) The equation of the parabola ( C ) is (boxed{x^2 = 6y}).(2) The minimum area of (triangle ABP) is (boxed{9}).]"},{"problem":"2. Let k, n be natural numbers.

We will show that for coprime natural numbers r and s, where r>2 and s>2, there exists a natural number n with the propertyr mid n-1 quad text { and } quad s mid n+1 .For such a number n and the number k=rs, Adam's reasoning is incorrect, because from the assumption that the number k divides the number (n-1)(n+1), it does not follow that k divides n-1 or that k divides n+1. If, for example, k=rs divided n-1, it would divide the number s both n+1 and n-1, which is impossible given the equality (n+1)-(n-1)=2, since s>2.The existence of the number n from the first sentence of the solution can be proven by considering s numbers2, r+2, 2r+2, ldots, (s-1)r+2 text {. }These numbers give different remainders when divided by the number s. If, for example, two of them, say ir+2 and jr+2(0 leqq i<j leqq s-1), gave the same remainder when divided by the number s, then the number s would also divide their difference (i-j)r, and given the coprimality of the numbers r and s, it would also divide the difference i-j, which is impossible because |i-j|<s. The s numbers thus form a complete residue system modulo s, so there exists a number among them that gives a remainder of 0 when divided by s, let this number be lr+2. Then for the number n=lr+1, it holds that r divides n-1 and s divides n+1.Let us realize that any number k divisible by two odd primes can be written as the product of two coprime numbers greater than 2. Adam's reasoning can therefore be correct only for those numbers k that are divisible by at most one odd prime. This means that the number k has one of the following three forms:k=2^{s}, quad k=p^{t}, quad k=2p^{t},where p is an odd prime, s is a non-negative integer, and t is a natural number.Let k=2^{s}, where s is a non-negative integer. For s=0, Adam's reasoning is incorrect, because the number k=2^{0}=1 divides every natural number, so it divides both numbers n-1 and n+1. For s=1, Adam's reasoning is also incorrect, because if k=2^{1}=2 divides the number (n-1)(n+1), one of the factors is even, but then the other factor is also even. For the number s=2, i.e., for k=2^{2}=4, Adam's reasoning is correct. If 4 divides the number (n-1)(n+1), at least one of the two factors is even, so they are two consecutive even numbers, of which exactly one is divisible by four. Finally, for any s geqq 3, Adam's reasoning is incorrect, it suffices to take the number n=2^{s-1}-1.Let k=p^{t}, where p is an odd prime and t is a natural number. Then Adam's reasoning is correct, because the numbers n-1 and n+1 cannot both be divisible by the same odd prime p, so exactly one of them is divisible by the number p^{t}=k.Let k=2p^{t}, where p is an odd prime and t is a natural number. Then Adam's reasoning is also correct: the numbers n-1 and n+1 are necessarily even and cannot both be divisible by the same odd prime p, so exactly one of them is divisible by the number 2p^{t}=k.Conclusion.

The problem states that if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by k, then either n-1 or n+1 must be divisible by k, and this has to hold for every natural number n. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what Adam is saying. He's basically saying that if the product of two numbers, (n-1) and (n+1), is divisible by k, then at least one of those two numbers must be divisible by k. So, in other words, k divides the product implies k divides at least one of the factors. That sounds like a property related to prime numbers, where primes have the characteristic that if they divide a product, they must divide one of the factors. But maybe composite numbers can also have this property under certain conditions? Let me think.First, if k is a prime number, then yes, if a prime divides a product, it must divide one of the factors. So if k is prime, then whenever k divides (n-1)(n+1), it must divide either n-1 or n+1. So primes would satisfy Adam's conclusion. But what if k is composite? For example, take k=4. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4. Does that mean either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4? Let's check with some examples. Let n=3. Then (3-1)(3+1)=2*4=8, which is divisible by 4. Here, n+1=4 is divisible by 4. So that works. Another example: n=2. Then (2-1)(2+1)=1*3=3, not divisible by 4. So that's okay. What about n=5? (5-1)(5+1)=4*6=24, divisible by 4. Here, n-1=4 is divisible by 4. Another example: n=1. Then (0)(2)=0, which is divisible by 4. But here, n-1=0 is divisible by 4 (since 0 is divisible by any number). Hmm. Wait, but what if n=4? Then (3)(5)=15, which is not divisible by 4. So that's okay. How about n=7? (6)(8)=48, divisible by 4. Either 6 or 8, and 8 is divisible by 4. So seems okay. Wait, but let me test a case where k is composite but the factors aren't divisible by k. Let's take k=6. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6. Does that mean either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 6? Let's test n=4. Then (3)(5)=15, which is not divisible by 6. Okay, so not an issue. What about n=5: (4)(6)=24, which is divisible by 6. Here, 6 divides 6, so that's okay. n=7: (6)(8)=48 divisible by 6, and 6 divides 6. n=2: (1)(3)=3, not divisible by 6. n=3: (2)(4)=8, not divisible by 6. n=6: (5)(7)=35, not divisible by 6. Wait, but maybe there's a case where 6 divides (n-1)(n+1) but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 6. Let's see. Let's take n=5: 4*6=24, which is divisible by 6. Here, 6 divides 6. So that's okay. How about n=7: 6*8=48. 6 divides 6. Hmm. What if n=1: 0*2=0, which is divisible by 6. Here, 0 is divisible by 6. Wait, maybe another number. Let's take k=8. Let's see. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 8. Does that mean either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 8? Let's take n=3: 2*4=8, divisible by 8. Here, 4 is divisible by 4, but 8 divides 8. So 8 divides 8. But n=5: 4*6=24, which is divisible by 8. Here, neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 8. Wait, 24 is divisible by 8, but 4 and 6 aren't. So here, k=8 would not satisfy Adam's conclusion. Because 8 divides 4*6=24, but neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 8. Therefore, Adam's conclusion would be incorrect here. So k=8 is a composite number where Adam's reasoning fails.So maybe composite numbers that have two coprime factors? Wait, but 8 is 2^3, which is not a product of coprime numbers. Wait, but 4 is 2^2. Let's check k=4 again. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4. Then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4? Let's take n=3: 2*4=8, which is divisible by 4. Here, 4 divides 4. n=1: 0*2=0, which is divisible by 4. 0 is divisible by 4. n=2: 1*3=3, not divisible by 4. n=4: 3*5=15, not divisible by 4. n=5: 4*6=24, divisible by 4. 4 divides 4. n=6: 5*7=35, not divisible by 4. n=7: 6*8=48, divisible by 4. 8 is divisible by 4. So far, all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4, at least one factor is divisible by 4. Is this always true? Let's check n=9: 8*10=80, divisible by 4. 8 is divisible by 4. n=10: 9*11=99, not divisible by 4. Hmm. Wait, but let's see. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4. Since n-1 and n+1 are two even numbers (because they are two apart), so their product is divisible by 4. But wait, actually, if n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are even. So their product is divisible by 4. But if n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are odd, so their product is odd, not divisible by 4. So in the cases where n is odd, (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4, but both factors are even, but not necessarily divisible by 4. Wait, but if n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are consecutive even numbers, so one of them is divisible by 4. Because every two even numbers, one is 2 mod 4 and the other is 0 mod 4. For example, n=3: 2 and 4. 4 is divisible by 4. n=5: 4 and 6. 4 is divisible by 4. n=7: 6 and 8. 8 is divisible by 4. Similarly, n=1: 0 and 2. 0 is divisible by 4. So in all these cases, when n is odd, one of the two numbers is divisible by 4. If n is even, then (n-1)(n+1) is odd*odd=odd, which is not divisible by 4. Therefore, for k=4, whenever the product is divisible by 4, one of the factors must be divisible by 4. Therefore, Adam's conclusion is correct for k=4. But for k=8, we saw that n=5: 4*6=24 divisible by 8, but neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 8. So Adam's conclusion is false for k=8.So why does k=4 work but k=8 not? Let's analyze this. For k=4, when is (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 4? As we saw, only when n is odd, in which case one of the two consecutive even numbers is divisible by 4, so the product is divisible by 8, hence divisible by 4. Wait, but if n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are two even numbers, so their product is divisible by 4. But actually, in this case, since they are two consecutive even numbers (e.g., 2 and 4, 4 and 6, etc.), one of them must be divisible by 4. Therefore, the product is divisible by 2*4=8. Therefore, in this case, (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 8 when n is odd, so divisible by 4 as well. Therefore, if k=4, then even though the product is divisible by 4, it's actually divisible by 8. So even more, but in any case, for k=4, whenever the product is divisible by 4, which is when n is odd, one of the factors is divisible by 4. So Adam's conclusion holds. But for k=8, even though the product is divisible by 8 (when n is odd), the factors (n-1) and (n+1) are consecutive even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4, but not necessarily 8. For example, n=5: 4 and 6, product=24, which is divisible by 8, but neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 8. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails here. Therefore, k=4 works, k=8 doesn't. So why the difference?Similarly, let's check k=9. Suppose k=9. Let's see if (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 9 implies one of the factors is divisible by 9. Let's take n=4: 3*5=15, not divisible by 9. n=8: 7*9=63, which is divisible by 9. Here, 9 is a factor. n=10: 9*11=99, divisible by 9. 9 is a factor. n=5: 4*6=24, not divisible by 9. n=2: 1*3=3, not divisible by 9. n=7: 6*8=48, not divisible by 9. n=1: 0*2=0, divisible by 9. 0 is divisible by 9. n=3: 2*4=8, not divisible by 9. n=9: 8*10=80, not divisible by 9. n=10: 9*11=99. So 99 is divisible by 9, and 9 is a factor. So far, seems okay. Wait, but is there a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 9, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 9? Let's see. Let's take n= sqrt(9m +1). Hmm, maybe n= 9m +1 or 9m -1? Wait, perhaps n=10: 9*11=99, which is divisible by 9, and 9 is a factor. What about n=5: 4*6=24, not divisible by 9. How about n=4: 3*5=15, not divisible by 9. Wait, maybe n=14: 13*15=195. 195 divided by 9 is 21.666..., so not divisible by 9. How about n=7: 6*8=48, not divisible by 9. Hmm. Wait, is there a value of n where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 9 but neither factor is? Let me think. Suppose both n-1 and n+1 are multiples of 3 but not 9. Then their product would be divisible by 9. For example, let n-1=3 and n+1=6. Then n-1=3, n+1=6, which would imply n=4. Then (3)(6)=18, which is divisible by 9. But 3 and 6: 3 is not divisible by 9, 6 is not divisible by 9, but 3*6=18 is divisible by 9. Therefore, Adam's conclusion would fail here. So for k=9, there exists n=4 where (n-1)(n+1)=18 is divisible by 9, but neither 3 nor 6 is divisible by 9. Therefore, Adam's conclusion is incorrect for k=9. Therefore, k=9 doesn't work.So primes work, k=4 works, but k=8 and k=9 do not. So what's special about k=4? Let me analyze k=2. For k=2, if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2, then at least one of them must be even. Since n is a natural number, either n is even or odd. If n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are both odd, so their product is odd, not divisible by 2. If n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are even, so their product is even. But in that case, both factors are even, so divisible by 2. So for k=2, if the product is divisible by 2, then n is odd, so both factors are even. Therefore, Adam's conclusion is that either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 2. But in reality, both are divisible by 2, so Adam's conclusion is still correct, because \\"either\\" is an inclusive or. So even if both are divisible, the conclusion holds. So k=2 works.Wait, but let me test it. If k=2, then when is (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 2? When n is odd, as we saw. Then both n-1 and n+1 are even. So Adam says \\"either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 2\\". But both are, so the conclusion is true. So even though both are divisible, the conclusion still holds. Therefore, k=2 is okay. Similarly, for k=3. Let's check if k=3 works. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 3. Then either n-1 or n+1 must be divisible by 3. Since 3 is prime, this holds. Because if 3 divides a product, it divides at least one factor. So n-1 or n+1 must be divisible by 3. Therefore, for prime k, this holds. So primes are okay. But k=4 is not prime, yet it works. So maybe k=1? For k=1, every number is divisible by 1, so the statement is trivial. Adam's conclusion is that either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 1, which is always true. So k=1 works. So k=1, primes, and k=4? Wait, so 4 is a prime power. Let's check other prime powers.Let's take k=5, which is prime. It works. k=9, which is 3^2, we saw that it doesn't work. So why does k=4=2^2 work but k=9=3^2 doesn't? Let's analyze. For k=4, when the product is divisible by 4, as we saw, either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4. But when we have k=9, we can have cases where neither is divisible by 9, but their product is. So why the difference? Let's think about the structure of the numbers.In the case of k=4=2^2, the product (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 4. Since n-1 and n+1 are two even numbers when n is odd, their product is divisible by 4. But in fact, since they are two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 4. For example, if n is odd, then n=2m+1, so n-1=2m and n+1=2m+2=2(m+1). So consecutive even numbers, so one of them is divisible by 4. Therefore, their product is divisible by 8, but at least one of them is divisible by 4. Therefore, in this case, if the product is divisible by 4, then one of the factors is divisible by 4, hence Adam's conclusion holds.But for k=9=3^2, suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 9. Then either 3^2 divides n-1 or 3^2 divides n+1. But if n-1 and n+1 are both divisible by 3 but not by 9, then their product is divisible by 9 (since 3*3=9), but neither factor is divisible by 9. So in this case, Adam's conclusion fails.Therefore, the difference is that in the case of k=4, when the product is divisible by 4, the structure of the numbers n-1 and n+1 (being consecutive even numbers) forces one of them to be divisible by 4. However, for k=9, the numbers n-1 and n+1 are two apart, so if both are divisible by 3, they can each have one factor of 3, making their product divisible by 9, without either having two factors of 3. Therefore, k=4 works because the two numbers are consecutive even numbers, so one must be divisible by 4, but for k=9, the numbers n-1 and n+1 can both be divisible by 3 without either being divisible by 9.Therefore, the key difference is the exponent in the prime power. For prime squares, like 3^2, the conclusion fails, but for 2^2, it works. Wait, so why does 2^2 work? Because when the product is divisible by 4, the two numbers n-1 and n+1 are consecutive even numbers, so one must be divisible by 4. But in the case of 3^2, the numbers n-1 and n+1 are two apart, so they can both be divisible by 3, but not by 9.Therefore, perhaps the prime power k=p^m works if and only if p=2 and m=2? Wait, but let's check k=8=2^3. For k=8, we saw that the product can be divisible by 8 without either factor being divisible by 8. For example, n=5: 4*6=24, which is divisible by 8. But 4 and 6 are divisible by 2 and 3, respectively, but not by 8. Therefore, k=8 does not work.Wait, but in the case of k=4=2^2, n-1 and n+1 are consecutive even numbers, so one is divisible by 4. But for higher powers of 2, like 8, this doesn't hold. Because for example, if n=5, n-1=4, n+1=6. Their product is 24, which is divisible by 8, but 4 is divisible by 4 but not 8, and 6 is divisible by 2 but not 8. So even though n-1 is divisible by 4, it's not enough for 8. Therefore, k=4 works because one of the consecutive even numbers is divisible by 4, but for higher powers, you need more factors of 2, which aren't guaranteed.Therefore, perhaps the only prime powers that work are k=2, 4. Wait, but k=2 is a prime, which works. k=4 is 2^2, which also works. But 8=2^3 does not. So maybe only primes and 4? Wait, but 4 is not a prime, it's a prime square. Wait, but 4 is a special case where the two factors are consecutive even numbers, which ensures that one is divisible by 4. Let's see for k=3: primes work. For k=3, if the product is divisible by 3, then one of the factors must be divisible by 3, so that's okay. For k=9, the product could be divisible by 9 without either factor being divisible by 9. So prime powers higher than 1 don't work except for 2^2=4. Hmm, interesting.So, perhaps the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, or any prime number. Wait, but primes include 2, which is already in the list. Wait, let me clarify. Wait, 4 is a composite number, but it works. So maybe the answer is all primes and 4. Or maybe k is either 1, 2, 4, or any prime. Wait, but 1 is a natural number, but 1 divides everything, and Adam's conclusion is trivial because \\"either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 1\\" is always true. So k=1 works. Then primes, 2, 3, 5, etc., work. Also, 4 works. So the answer would be k=1, 2, 4, or any prime. Wait, but primes include 2 and 3, etc. But in that case, 4 is separate. So the answer is all primes, 1, and 4. Wait, but 1 is a unit, but the problem says natural numbers k. So natural numbers start at 1. So possible answer is k=1, 2, 4, or any prime. Let me check for k=6. Wait, earlier we saw that k=6, which is composite, but if we have (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 6, does that imply one of the factors is divisible by 6? Let's test n=5: 4*6=24 divisible by 6. Here, 6 is divisible by 6. n=7: 6*8=48 divisible by 6, 6 is divisible by 6. n=2: 1*3=3 not divisible by 6. n=4: 3*5=15 not divisible by 6. n=6: 5*7=35 not divisible by 6. But what if n=3: 2*4=8 not divisible by 6. n=8: 7*9=63, divisible by 6? 63 divided by 6 is 10.5, so no. Wait, how about n=11: 10*12=120 divisible by 6. Here, 12 is divisible by 6. So in this case, works. Is there a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 6? Let's see. Let's take n=5: 4*6=24 divisible by 6. 6 is divisible by 6. n=7: 6*8=48 divisible by 6, same thing. How about n=4: 3*5=15 not divisible by 6. n=9: 8*10=80 not divisible by 6. Wait, maybe n= sqrt(6m +1). Hmmm. Let's take n=7: 6*8=48. 48 is divisible by 6, and 6 is a factor. How about n=2: 1*3=3, not divisible by 6. n=5: already checked. Maybe n=1: 0*2=0 divisible by 6. 0 is divisible by 6. So here, n-1=0 is divisible by 6. So in all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 6? Wait, let's see. Suppose n=3: 2*4=8, not divisible by 6. n=4: 3*5=15, not divisible by 6. n=5: 4*6=24 divisible by 6. Here, 6 is a factor. n=6: 5*7=35, not divisible by 6. n=7: 6*8=48 divisible by 6. 6 is a factor. n=8: 7*9=63, not divisible by 6. n=9: 8*10=80, not divisible by 6. n=10: 9*11=99, not divisible by 6. n=11: 10*12=120 divisible by 6. 12 is a factor. Wait, so in all the cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 6. Because if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, then it's divisible by 2 and 3. So since 2 and 3 are primes, 2 divides one of the factors and 3 divides one of the factors. But since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, the factors 2 and 3 can't both divide the same number unless that number is divisible by 6. Let me explain. Suppose 2 divides (n-1) or (n+1). Similarly, 3 divides (n-1) or (n+1). If 2 divides one factor and 3 divides the other, then neither factor is divisible by 6. However, if both 2 and 3 divide the same factor, then that factor is divisible by 6. So in order for (n-1)(n+1) to be divisible by 6, either:1. One of the factors is divisible by 6, hence divisible by both 2 and 3, or2. One factor is divisible by 2 and the other is divisible by 3.But in case 2, since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, if one is divisible by 2 and the other by 3, is that possible? Let's check with an example. Let n=5: 4 and 6. 4 is divisible by 2, 6 is divisible by 6. Wait, that's case 1. Another example: n=7: 6 and 8. 6 is divisible by 6, 8 by 2. Hmm. How about n=2: 1 and 3. Not divisible by 6. n=4: 3 and 5. Not divisible by 6. n=10: 9 and 11. 9 is divisible by 3, 11 is not. 9*11=99, which is divisible by 3 but not by 2, so not divisible by 6. Wait, but how about n=7: 6 and 8. 6 is divisible by 6. n=5: 4 and 6. 6 is divisible by 6. Wait, maybe in all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, one of the factors is divisible by 6. Let me test n=3: 2*4=8, not divisible by 6. n=5: 4*6=24, divisible by 6. 6 is divisible by 6. n=7: 6*8=48, divisible by 6. 6 is divisible by 6. n=11: 10*12=120, divisible by 6. 12 is divisible by 6. n=13: 12*14=168, divisible by 6. 12 is divisible by 6. Hmm. Wait, but let me see if there's a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6 but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 6. For example, suppose n=4: 3*5=15, not divisible by 6. n=8: 7*9=63, not divisible by 6. n=10: 9*11=99, not divisible by 6. Hmmm. Maybe it's not possible? Let's suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6. Then it's divisible by 2 and 3. Let's see: Since 2 divides the product, either n-1 or n+1 is even. Similarly, 3 divides the product, so either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 3. If both 2 and 3 divide the same factor, then that factor is divisible by 6. If they divide different factors, then n-1 and n+1 are two numbers such that one is divisible by 2 and the other by 3, but since they are two apart, is that possible? Let's suppose n-1 is divisible by 2 and n+1 is divisible by 3. Then n-1 ≡ 0 mod 2, so n ≡1 mod 2. n+1 ≡0 mod 3, so n ≡2 mod 3. So solving these two congruences: n ≡1 mod 2 and n≡2 mod 3. Let's find such an n. For example, n=5: 5≡1 mod 2, 5≡2 mod 3. Then (5-1)=4 divisible by 2, (5+1)=6 divisible by 3. But 6 is also divisible by 6. So in this case, the other factor is divisible by 6. Wait, but if n≡2 mod 3, then n+1≡0 mod 3. So if n≡2 mod 3 and n is odd, then n+1 is divisible by 3, and n-1 is even. For example, n=5: n+1=6 divisible by 3 and 2. So in this case, n+1 is divisible by 6. Therefore, even though we thought maybe 2 and 3 divide different factors, in reality, one of the factors is divisible by both. Wait, this might be the case. Because if n≡2 mod 3 and n≡1 mod 2, then n+1≡0 mod 3 and n+1≡0 mod 2 (since n is odd, n+1 is even). Therefore, n+1 is divisible by both 2 and 3, hence by 6. Similarly, if n≡1 mod 3 and n is odd, then n-1≡0 mod 3 and n-1 is even, so n-1 divisible by 6. Therefore, in any case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, one of the factors must be divisible by 6. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=6. Wait, but this contradicts my previous thought where I thought maybe 2 divides one and 3 divides the other. But in reality, if n is odd, then one of the factors is even and the other is even as well. Wait, no. Wait, if n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are both even. So if n is odd, then both factors are even, so divisible by 2, but for divisibility by 3, one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, then since n is odd (as both factors are even), one of the factors is divisible by 3. Therefore, the other factor is divisible by 2. But since both factors are even, both are divisible by 2. Therefore, one factor is divisible by 2 and 3 (hence 6), and the other is divisible by 2. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=6. Wait, so if the product is divisible by 6, then one of the factors is divisible by 6. For example, n=5: 4*6=24. 6 is divisible by 6. n=7: 6*8=48. 6 is divisible by 6. n=11: 10*12=120. 12 is divisible by 6. So in all these cases, one of the factors is divisible by 6. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=6. But earlier, I thought there might be a case where 2 divides one and 3 divides the other, but in reality, since the numbers are two apart and one of them is divisible by 3, if n is odd, then one of the consecutive even numbers must be divisible by 6. Wait, let's check with n=7: 6 and 8. 6 is divisible by 6. n=5: 4 and 6. 6 is divisible by 6. n=9: 8 and 10. Neither is divisible by 3, so the product isn't divisible by 6. Wait, n=9: (8)(10)=80, not divisible by 6. So if n is odd and not congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3, then the product isn't divisible by 6. So if the product is divisible by 6, then n must be such that one of the factors is divisible by 3. Therefore, that factor is even and divisible by 3, hence divisible by 6. Therefore, Adam's conclusion is correct for k=6. So maybe composite numbers like 6 also work? Wait, but then what about k=12? Let me test k=12. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 12. Does that imply either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 12? Let's take n=11: 10*12=120 divisible by 12. Here, 12 is divisible by 12. n=13: 12*14=168 divisible by 12. 12 is divisible by 12. n=5: 4*6=24 divisible by 12. Here, 24 is divisible by 12. But 4 and 6: neither is divisible by 12. So here, Adam's conclusion fails. Therefore, for k=12, it's possible to have (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 12 without either factor being divisible by 12. Therefore, Adam's conclusion is incorrect for k=12. So k=6 works, but k=12 doesn't. Hmm, so why does k=6 work? Let's check. If (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, then since n must be odd (as the product is even and divisible by 3). If n is odd, then one of n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4 (if k=6, but wait, k=6 requires divisibility by 2 and 3). Wait, but when we have k=6, if the product is divisible by 6, then since n must be odd (to have even numbers), and one of the even numbers must be divisible by 3. Therefore, that even number is divisible by 6. For example, n=5: 4 and 6, 6 is divisible by 6. n=7: 6 and 8, 6 is divisible by 6. n=11: 10 and 12, 12 is divisible by 6. Similarly, n=1: 0 and 2, 0 is divisible by 6. So in all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, one of the factors is divisible by 6. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds. So why does k=12 fail? Because 12=4*3. If (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 12, then it's divisible by 4 and 3. For divisibility by 4, since n is odd, one of the consecutive even numbers is divisible by 4, and the other is divisible by 2. For divisibility by 3, one of them is divisible by 3. But the factor divisible by 4 could be different from the one divisible by 3. For example, take n=5: 4*6=24. 24 is divisible by 12. Here, 4 is divisible by 4, 6 is divisible by 3 and 2. So neither is divisible by 12. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails. Therefore, k=12 doesn't work. But k=6 works. So why is that?For k=6, the prime factors are 2 and 3. Since (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2 and 3. For divisibility by 2, both factors are even. For divisibility by 3, one factor is divisible by 3. Therefore, the factor divisible by 3 is even, hence divisible by 6. Therefore, one of the factors must be divisible by 6. Therefore, k=6 works. But for k=12, which is 4*3, the 4 requires one factor divisible by 4, and 3 requires one factor divisible by 3. But the factors divisible by 4 and 3 can be different. Hence, neither factor may be divisible by 12. Therefore, k=12 fails.Therefore, perhaps k must be a product of distinct primes and 4. Wait, but k=6=2*3 works. k=4=2^2 works. But k=12=4*3 doesn't work. So maybe the answer is all natural numbers k that are primes, or 1, or 4. But k=6 also works. Wait, but 6 is composite. So my earlier analysis must be missing something.Wait, let me test k=5: prime. Works. k=6: composite, works. k=7: prime, works. k=4: composite, works. k=12: composite, doesn't work. k=8: composite, doesn't work. k=9: composite, doesn't work. k=10: composite, let's check. For k=10, if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 10, then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 10. Let's see. Take n=5: 4*6=24, not divisible by 10. n=9: 8*10=80 divisible by 10. Here, 10 is a factor. n=11: 10*12=120 divisible by 10. 10 is a factor. n=1: 0*2=0 divisible by 10. 0 is divisible by 10. n=4: 3*5=15 not divisible by 10. n=6: 5*7=35 not divisible by 10. n=10: 9*11=99 not divisible by 10. n=15: 14*16=224, which is 224 divisible by 10? 224/10=22.4, so no. n=20: 19*21=399, not divisible by 10. Wait, is there a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 10, but neither factor is divisible by 10? Let's take n=5: 4*6=24, not divisible by 10. n=7: 6*8=48, not divisible by 10. n=9: 8*10=80, divisible by 10. 10 is a factor. n=11: 10*12=120, divisible by 10. 10 is a factor. How about n=14: 13*15=195, which is divisible by 5 but not by 10. 195/10=19.5. Not divisible. n=16: 15*17=255, divisible by 5 but not 10. n=21: 20*22=440 divisible by 10. 20 is a factor. So seems like whenever (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 10, one of the factors is divisible by 10. Wait, let's check n= sqrt(10m +1). Not sure. Let me think. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 10. Then it must be divisible by 2 and 5. Since 2 and 5 are primes, one of the factors is divisible by 2, and one of the factors is divisible by 5. But if they're different factors, then one is divisible by 2 and the other by 5, but since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, if one is divisible by 5, the other is 2 away. So can a number divisible by 5 and another number two apart divisible by 2? For example, n=6: 5 and 7. 5 divisible by 5, 7 not divisible by 2. n=5: 4 and 6. 4 divisible by 2, 6 divisible by 2 and 3. 5 is not involved. Wait, but if n is such that n-1 divisible by 5 and n+1 divisible by 2, then n-1=5m, so n=5m+1, which is even, so n+1=5m+2, which is even if m is odd. Wait, for example, m=1: n=6. Then n-1=5, divisible by 5. n+1=7, not divisible by 2. So product=35, not divisible by 10. If m=2: n=11. n-1=10 divisible by 5 and 2. n+1=12 divisible by 2. So product=120 divisible by 10. Here, n-1=10 is divisible by 10. So in this case, even though we thought maybe 5 divides one and 2 divides the other, but in reality, n-1 is divisible by both 5 and 2. Therefore, one of the factors is divisible by 10. Therefore, in all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 10, one of the factors must be divisible by 10. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=10. Wait, but earlier when I thought of n=5, the product was 24, not divisible by 10. So how come? If (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 10, then one of the factors must be divisible by 10. Let me verify with another example. Let n=21: 20*22=440 divisible by 10. 20 is divisible by 10. n=25: 24*26=624. 624 divided by 10 is 62.4, so not divisible by 10. n=26: 25*27=675, not divisible by 10. n=30: 29*31=899, not divisible by 10. Hmm. Wait, how do we get (n-1)(n+1) divisible by 10? Let's see. 10 divides the product. So 2 and 5 must divide the product. Since 2 and 5 are primes, they must each divide one of the factors. So either:1. 2 divides n-1 and 5 divides n+1, or2. 5 divides n-1 and 2 divides n+1.But since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, if 5 divides one of them, the other is two away. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, etc. If n-1=5, then n=6, n+1=7. 7 is not divisible by 2. So product=5*7=35, not divisible by 10. If n-1=10, then n=11, n+1=12. 12 is divisible by 2. So product=10*12=120 divisible by 10. Here, 10 is divisible by 10. If n+1=5, then n=4, n-1=3. 3 is not divisible by 2. Product=3*5=15, not divisible by 10. If n+1=10, then n=9, n-1=8. 8 is divisible by 2. Product=8*10=80 divisible by 10. 10 is divisible by 10. If n-1=15, n=16, n+1=17. 17 not divisible by 2. Product=15*17=255, not divisible by 10. If n+1=15, n=14, n-1=13. 13 not divisible by 2. Product=13*15=195, not divisible by 10. Therefore, it seems that the only way for (n-1)(n+1) to be divisible by 10 is if one of the factors is divisible by 10. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=10. Therefore, k=10 works. Then, my previous reasoning was incorrect. Therefore, k=6 and k=10, which are composite, work. So maybe the answer includes composite numbers as well. Wait, but why do k=6, 10 work, but k=12, 8, 9 don't?Wait, k=6=2*3. For k=6, as we saw, if the product is divisible by 6, then one of the factors must be divisible by 6. Similarly, k=10=2*5. If the product is divisible by 10, then one of the factors must be divisible by 10. But for k=12=4*3, the product can be divisible by 12 without either factor being divisible by 12. So what's the difference between k=6,10 and k=12,8,9? The key seems to be that for k=6 and 10, which are products of distinct primes, if the product is divisible by k, then since k is square-free (no repeated prime factors), the factors must each be divisible by different primes, but since the primes are distinct and the numbers are two apart, they can't be both divided by different primes. Wait, but 6=2*3. If the product is divisible by 6, then one factor must be divisible by 2 and the other by 3. But since the numbers are two apart, if one is divisible by 3, the other is two away. But numbers divisible by 3 are spaced three apart, so if one is divisible by 3, the other can't be unless the two numbers are 3 and 6, which are three apart. But since our numbers are two apart, the only way both to have one divisible by 2 and one divisible by 3 is that the number divisible by 3 is also divisible by 2, hence divisible by 6. Therefore, in that case, one of the factors is divisible by 6. Similarly, for k=10=2*5. If the product is divisible by 10, then one factor is divisible by 2 and the other by 5. But since they are two apart, the number divisible by 5 can't be two away from a number divisible by 2 unless it's even. Therefore, the number divisible by 5 must also be divisible by 2, hence divisible by 10. Therefore, one of the factors is divisible by 10. Therefore, for square-free k (products of distinct primes), if the primes are such that the required divisibility conditions force one of the factors to be divisible by k. However, for k with repeated prime factors or composite numbers with non-distinct prime factors, this may not hold.Wait, but k=4=2^2 is not square-free, but it works. So perhaps the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, or any square-free natural number (product of distinct primes). But 4 is not square-free, yet it works. So that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the answer is k=1, 2, 4, or any prime. But k=6 and 10 are composite and work. So this is confusing.Let me try to find a pattern. For k=1: trivial. For k=2: prime, works. k=3: prime, works. k=4: works. k=5: prime, works. k=6: composite, works. k=7: prime, works. k=8: composite, doesn't work. k=9: composite, doesn't work. k=10: composite, works. k=11: prime, works. k=12: composite, doesn't work. k=13: prime, works. So the composite numbers that work are 4, 6, 10. What do they have in common? Let's factor them: 4=2^2, 6=2*3, 10=2*5. So they all have 2 as a prime factor and another prime or another 2. Hmmm. But 4=2^2 works, 8=2^3 doesn't. 6=2*3 works, 12=2^2*3 doesn't. 10=2*5 works, 14=2*7: let's check k=14. For k=14, if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 14, does that imply one of the factors is divisible by 14? Let's see. Let n=8: 7*9=63, not divisible by 14. n=15: 14*16=224 divisible by 14. 14 is divisible by 14. n=13: 12*14=168 divisible by 14. 14 is divisible by 14. n=21: 20*22=440 divisible by 14? 440/14≈31.428, so no. n=29: 28*30=840 divisible by 14. 840/14=60. Here, 28 is divisible by 14. Is there a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 14, but neither factor is divisible by 14? Let's try n= sqrt(14m +1). Let me think. Suppose n-1=7 and n+1=9. Then n=8. 7*9=63, not divisible by 14. If n-1=14, then n=15, n+1=16. 14*16=224 divisible by 14. 14 is a factor. If n+1=14, then n=13, n-1=12. 12*14=168 divisible by 14. 14 is a factor. How about n=20: 19*21=399, not divisible by 14. n=22: 21*23=483, not divisible by 14. n=16: 15*17=255, not divisible by 14. n=9: 8*10=80, not divisible by 14. It seems hard to find such a case. Wait, let's see. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 14. Then divisible by 2 and 7. Since 2 and 7 are primes, one factor is divisible by 2, and one by 7. If they are different factors, then one is divisible by 2, the other by 7. But since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, if one is divisible by 7, the other is two away. A number divisible by 7 and two away from a number divisible by 2. Let's see. Let n-1=7, so n=8. Then n+1=9, which is not divisible by 2. Product=7*9=63, not divisible by 14. If n+1=7, then n=6. n-1=5. Product=5*7=35, not divisible by 14. If n-1=14, then n=15, n+1=16. Product=14*16=224 divisible by 14. Here, 14 is divisible by 14. If n-1=21, then n=22, n+1=23. Product=21*23=483, not divisible by 14. So it seems that if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 14, then one of the factors must be divisible by 14. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=14. So composite numbers like 6,10,14, which are 2*p where p is a prime, seem to work. Similarly, 4=2^2 works. But 8=2^3 doesn't. So maybe k=2 and k=4, and k=2*p where p is a prime (including 2, which would be 4). Wait, 2*p where p is a prime greater than 2 would give 6,10,14, etc. Let's check k=2*p.For k=2*p, where p is an odd prime. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2*p. Then it must be divisible by 2 and p. Since p is a prime, one of the factors must be divisible by p. Also, one of the factors must be divisible by 2. If the same factor is divisible by both 2 and p, then it is divisible by 2*p. Otherwise, if different factors are divisible by 2 and p, then since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, and p is an odd prime greater than 2, the numbers divisible by p are spaced p apart. Therefore, if one factor is divisible by p, the other factor is two away, which cannot be divisible by p unless p=2. But since p is an odd prime, this is impossible. Therefore, the factor divisible by p must be even, hence divisible by 2*p. Therefore, one of the factors is divisible by 2*p. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=2*p, where p is a prime (including p=2, which gives k=4). So for k=2*p, where p is a prime, Adam's conclusion holds. Similarly, for k=1, trivial. And for k being a prime, it holds. Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers k where k is 1, 2, 4, or twice an odd prime, or any prime. Wait, but twice an odd prime includes k=6=2*3, 10=2*5, etc. And k=4=2*2. But 4 is also 2^2. So the general case would be k=1, 2, 4, primes, and twice primes. But wait, 4=2*2, which is twice the prime 2. So maybe the answer is all natural numbers k that are primes, twice primes, 1, or 4. Wait, but 2 is a prime and also twice the prime 1, but 1 isn't prime. Wait, maybe the answer is all k such that k is 1, 2, 4, any prime, or twice any prime. Let's check k=6=2*3. Yes. k=10=2*5. Yes. k=14=2*7. Yes. k=22=2*11, etc. And k=4=2*2. Yes. So in this case, the allowed k are:1, 2, 4, primes, and twice primes.But primes include 2,3,5,... and twice primes include 4=2*2, 6=2*3, 10=2*5, etc. Wait, but twice primes includes 4 as a special case where the prime is 2. So combining these, the allowed k's are 1, primes (including 2), and twice primes (including 4, 6, 10, etc.). So the answer would be all natural numbers k where k is 1, a prime, or twice a prime.But we need to verify this. Let's check k=9=3*3. It's a square of a prime, doesn't work. k=8=2^3, which is a cube of a prime, doesn't work. k=12=2^2*3, which is not a prime or twice a prime, doesn't work. k=25=5^2, doesn't work. k=7=prime, works. k=14=2*7, works. So this seems to fit.Therefore, the natural numbers k for which Adam's reasoning is correct are:1, all prime numbers, and twice all prime numbers (including 4=2*2).Therefore, the answer is all k ∈ ℕ such that k=1, k is a prime, or k is twice a prime.To write this in the required format, we need to specify these k. The problem asks to determine all natural numbers k for which Adam's reasoning is correct for every natural n. So the answer is all natural numbers k that are either 1, a prime number, or twice a prime number.But let's make sure about the case when k=1. For k=1, every number is divisible by 1, so the statement is trivially true. For k=2, which is a prime, works. For k=3, prime, works. For k=4=2*2, twice a prime, works. For k=6=2*3, twice a prime, works. For k=5, prime, works. For k=10=2*5, twice a prime, works. And so on. So these are the numbers. Therefore, the answer is that k must be 1, a prime, or twice a prime.Therefore, the final answer is all natural numbers k such that k is 1, a prime, or twice a prime. In mathematical terms, k ∈ {1} ∪ {p, 2p | p is a prime}.But to write this in the boxed notation, we need to express it as per the problem's requirement. The standard way to write this is listing the conditions. However, since the answer requires specifying all such k, we can describe it as:All natural numbers k that are either 1, a prime number, or twice a prime number.But the problem may expect listing in a mathematical notation. However, since it's a descriptive answer, we can use the boxed notation to present the solution.But let me check once more. For k=1: yes. For k=prime: yes. For k=2p where p is a prime (including p=2): yes. All these cases work. Other composite numbers (not 1, not prime, not twice a prime) like 8,9,12 do not work. So the answer is k=1, primes, and twice primes.Hence, the final answer is:All natural numbers k equal to 1, a prime, or twice a prime. In boxed form, we can write this as:boxed{k text{ is } 1, text{ a prime}, text{ or twice a prime}}.But according to the problem's instruction, the answer should be in boxed notation. However, if the problem expects specific numbers or a specific set, maybe a different format. But since primes and twice primes are infinite sets, we cannot list them. Hence, the answer should be stated in words as above. But in math competitions, such answers are typically expressed as the set {1, 2, 4} union primes union twice primes. But primes and twice primes are infinite sets, so we need to describe them. Alternatively, using mathematical terms, k is 1, 2, 4, or any prime or double prime. But the standard way is to describe the conditions.Alternatively, the problem might consider 4 as a special case and answer that k must be 1, 2, 4, or an odd prime. But we saw that k=6=2*3 works, which is even and not 2 or 4. So that can't be.Therefore, the correct answer is that k must be 1, a prime number, or twice a prime number. So the answer is:boxed{k text{ is } 1, text{ a prime number, or twice a prime number}}.Alternatively, in the format requested, sometimes problems accept using set notation with conditions. However, given that the answer requires a description, the above boxed statement is appropriate.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( k ) are 1, primes, or twice primes. Thus, the solution is boxed{k text{ is } 1, text{ a prime}, text{ or twice a prime}}.</think>To determine all natural numbers ( k ) for which Adam's reasoning is correct, we need to check when the statement \\"if ((n-1)(n+1)) is divisible by ( k ), then either ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) is divisible by ( k )\\" holds for every natural number ( n ).1. Prime Numbers: If ( k ) is a prime number, then by the property of primes, if ( k ) divides a product, it must divide one of the factors. Hence, primes satisfy Adam's conclusion.2. Prime Powers: For ( k = 4 ) (which is ( 2^2 )), we analyze the product ((n-1)(n+1)). When ( n ) is odd, ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are consecutive even numbers, ensuring one of them is divisible by 4. For higher powers like ( 8 = 2^3 ), there exist cases where the product is divisible by ( 8 ) but neither factor is (e.g., ( n = 5 )), so ( k = 8 ) fails. Similarly, ( k = 9 = 3^2 ) fails as shown by ( n = 4 ).3. Composite Numbers: For composite numbers like ( k = 6 ) and ( k = 10 ), which are products of distinct primes, if the product is divisible by ( k ), one factor must be divisible by both primes (due to their spacing), hence divisible by ( k ). However, composites like ( k = 12 ) fail as shown by ( n = 5 ).4. Twice a Prime: For ( k = 2p ) where ( p ) is a prime (including ( 4 = 2 times 2 )), the product ((n-1)(n+1)) being divisible by ( 2p ) ensures one factor is divisible by ( 2 ) and the other by ( p ). Due to their spacing, the factor divisible by ( p ) must also be divisible by ( 2 ), hence by ( 2p ).5. Trivial Case: ( k = 1 ) trivially works as all numbers are divisible by 1.Thus, the natural numbers ( k ) for which Adam's reasoning is correct are those that are 1, a prime, or twice a prime. The final answer is:[boxed{k text{ is } 1, text{ a prime}, text{ or twice a prime}}],<think>Okay, so the problem is about figuring out for which natural numbers k, Adam's conclusion is always correct. The statement is that if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by k, then either n-1 or n+1 must be divisible by k. We need to find all k where this holds true for every natural number n.Hmm. Let me start by understanding what Adam is saying. He's claiming that whenever the product (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by k, at least one of the factors, n-1 or n+1, must be divisible by k. So, for Adam's reasoning to be correct, there can't be any n where both n-1 and n+1 are not divisible by k, but their product is. Our task is to determine for which k this is impossible; that is, for which k, whenever k divides (n-1)(n+1), k must divide at least one of the factors.First, maybe consider some examples. Let's take small values of k and see if Adam's conclusion holds.Starting with k=1. Well, every number is divisible by 1, so regardless of n, both n-1 and n+1 are divisible by 1, so Adam's conclusion is trivially true. So k=1 is okay.Next, k=2. Let's check if whenever (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2, then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 2. Let's see. For any n, if n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are both odd, so their product is odd, which isn't divisible by 2. If n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are both even, so their product is divisible by 4. But in that case, both factors are even, so each is divisible by 2. So, when k=2, if (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 2, which happens when n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are divisible by 2. So in this case, even though both are divisible by 2, Adam's conclusion is still true because \\"either n-1 or n+1\\" includes the possibility of both. So k=2 is okay.Wait, but does Adam's conclusion require exactly one of them to be divisible by k, or at least one? The problem says \\"either the number n-1 or the number n+1 is divisible by k\\". In logic, \\"either A or B\\" usually means \\"at least one\\", so inclusive or. So even if both are divisible, that's okay. So for k=2, since when the product is divisible by 2, at least one (in fact both) are divisible by 2. So k=2 works.Now k=3. Let's test if there exists an n such that (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 3, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 3. If such an n exists, then Adam's conclusion fails for k=3. Let's see.If 3 divides (n-1)(n+1), then 3 divides either n-1 or n+1, unless 3 divides neither but divides the product. But since 3 is prime, if 3 divides the product, it must divide one of the factors. So, in fact, for prime k, if k divides (n-1)(n+1), then k must divide n-1 or n+1. So primes satisfy Adam's conclusion. Therefore, k=3 is okay.Wait, but maybe if k is a prime power? Let's test k=4. Suppose k=4. Let's see if there exists an n where 4 divides (n-1)(n+1), but 4 doesn't divide either n-1 or n+1.Take n=2. Then (2-1)(2+1) = 1*3=3, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: (3-1)(3+1)=2*4=8, which is divisible by 4. Here, n+1=4 is divisible by 4, so okay. n=1: (0)(2)=0, which is divisible by 4, and n-1=0 is divisible by 4? Wait, 0 is divisible by any number, so yes. n=5: (4)(6)=24, divisible by 4. Here, n-1=4 is divisible by 4. n=4: (3)(5)=15, not divisible by 4. n=5: as above. Wait, what about n=7: (6)(8)=48, divisible by 4. Here, n+1=8 is divisible by 4. Hmm. Is there any n where 4 divides (n-1)(n+1) but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 4?Suppose n-1 and n+1 are both even (since they are two apart). So their product is divisible by 4 if at least one of them is divisible by 4, or if both are divisible by 2. Wait, if both are even, their product is divisible by 4. So if n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are even, so their product is divisible by 4. But in that case, if either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4, then 4 divides that term. If neither is divisible by 4, then both are congruent to 2 mod 4. So n-1 ≡ 2 mod 4 and n+1 ≡ 2 mod 4. But n-1 and n+1 are two apart. If n-1 ≡ 2 mod 4, then n+1 = (n-1) + 2 ≡ 0 mod 4. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if n-1 is 2 mod 4, then n is 3 mod 4, so n+1 is 4 mod 4, which is 0 mod 4. Therefore, if n-1 is 2 mod 4, then n+1 is 0 mod 4. Hence, in such a case, n+1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, it's impossible for both n-1 and n+1 to be 2 mod 4. Therefore, if n is odd, then exactly one of n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4, depending on whether n is 1 or 3 mod 4.Wait, hold on. Let's take n=3 mod 4. Then n=3: n-1=2, n+1=4. So n+1 is divisible by 4. If n=1 mod 4: n=1, n-1=0, n+1=2. So n-1 is 0 mod 4, so divisible by 4. If n is 3 mod 4: n+1 is 0 mod 4. If n is 2 mod 4: n even, so n-1 and n+1 are odd. Then (n-1)(n+1) is odd, not divisible by 4. If n is 0 mod 4: n=4, n-1=3, n+1=5. Their product is 15, not divisible by 4. Wait, so when n is even, the product is odd, not divisible by 4. When n is odd, n=1 or 3 mod 4, then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4, so the product is divisible by 4. Therefore, in all cases where the product is divisible by 4, one of the factors is divisible by 4. Hence, for k=4, Adam's conclusion is correct. Wait, but wait a minute, suppose n=5: n-1=4, n+1=6. Then (4)(6)=24, which is divisible by 4. Here, n-1=4 is divisible by 4. If n=7: n-1=6, n+1=8. The product is 48, divisible by 4, and n+1=8 is divisible by 4. So in both cases, either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 4.But what if n=1? Then n-1=0, n+1=2. The product is 0, which is divisible by 4, and n-1=0 is divisible by 4. So in all cases, even though both factors might be even, but one of them is divisible by 4. Therefore, for k=4, Adam's conclusion holds.Wait, so maybe prime powers? Wait, let's check k=4. Suppose k is 4. If 4 divides (n-1)(n+1), then one of the factors is divisible by 4. So in that case, Adam's conclusion is correct. Hmm. So perhaps k being a prime power?But let's check k=6. Let's see if Adam's conclusion holds for k=6. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6. Then 6 divides the product. If 6 divides the product, then 2 and 3 divide the product. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, 2 divides one factor and 3 divides the other, or both divide the same factor.But is it possible that 2 divides one factor and 3 divides the other, but neither factor is divisible by 6? For example, suppose n-1 is divisible by 2 but not 3, and n+1 is divisible by 3 but not 2. Then their product is divisible by 6, but neither factor is divisible by 6. So such an n would violate Adam's conclusion.Let's find such an n. Let's suppose n-1 ≡ 0 mod 2, so n is odd. Then n-1 is even. Let's set n+1 ≡ 0 mod 3. So n ≡ 2 mod 3. Let's find n such that n is odd and n ≡ 2 mod 3. For example, n=5: n=5 is odd, n ≡ 2 mod 3? 5 mod 3 is 2. Yes. Then n-1=4, which is divisible by 2 but not by 6. n+1=6, which is divisible by 6. Wait, n+1=6 is divisible by 6, so actually, in this case, n+1 is divisible by 6. So Adam's conclusion holds here.Wait, but maybe n=7: n=7 is odd. n ≡ 1 mod 3. n-1=6, divisible by 6. So here, n-1 is divisible by 6. So maybe this example isn't working.Wait, let's take n=11. n=11 is odd. n ≡ 2 mod 3: 11 mod 3 is 2. Then n-1=10, which is divisible by 2 but not by 3. n+1=12, which is divisible by 3 and 4. So 12 is divisible by 6. So n+1=12 is divisible by 6. So again, n+1 is divisible by 6.Wait, maybe there's no such n where n-1 is divisible by 2 but not 3, and n+1 divisible by 3 but not 2. Let's see. Let's set n-1 ≡ 0 mod 2, so n ≡ 1 mod 2. n+1 ≡ 0 mod 3, so n ≡ 2 mod 3. So combining these, n ≡ 5 mod 6. Let's take n=5: n-1=4 (divisible by 2, not 3), n+1=6 (divisible by 6). So n+1 is divisible by 6. Similarly, n=11: n-1=10 (divisible by 2, not 3), n+1=12 (divisible by 6). So in this case, n+1 is divisible by 6. So perhaps even if we set it up this way, one of the factors ends up being divisible by 6. Hmm. Maybe for k=6, Adam's conclusion still holds.Wait, maybe I need a different example. Let me try k=8. Let's see if there's an n where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 8, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 8. Let's see. Let's take n=5. Then (4)(6)=24, which is divisible by 8? 24/8=3. Yes. Now, n-1=4, which is not divisible by 8, and n+1=6, which is not divisible by 8. So here, (n-1)(n+1)=24 is divisible by 8, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 8. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails for k=8. Therefore, k=8 is not valid.But wait, wait. Let's check n=5. (4)(6)=24. 24 is divisible by 8. But 4 and 6 are factors. Neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 8, so indeed, Adam's conclusion fails here. Therefore, k=8 is invalid.Therefore, composite numbers like 8 don't satisfy Adam's condition. So now, what's special about k=1,2,3,4, which worked, and 8 didn't?Wait, but k=6. Let me check again. Let's try n=5. Then (4)(6)=24. 24 is divisible by 6. Now, n-1=4 is not divisible by 6, but n+1=6 is divisible by 6. So here, even though the product is divisible by 6, one of the factors is divisible by 6. So Adam's conclusion holds. Wait, but let's take n=7. Then (6)(8)=48. 48 is divisible by 6. Here, n-1=6 is divisible by 6. So in both cases, one of the factors is divisible by 6.Wait, but is there a case where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 6? Let's try n=4: (3)(5)=15, not divisible by 6. n=3: (2)(4)=8, not divisible by 6. n=2: (1)(3)=3, not divisible by 6. n=1: (0)(2)=0, which is divisible by 6. But n-1=0 is divisible by 6. So again, 0 is divisible by any k. So maybe in all cases where (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, one of the factors is 0, which is divisible by 6, or one of the factors is divisible by 6. Wait, n=5: n+1=6, which is divisible by 6. n=7: n-1=6. n=0: n=0, ( -1)(1)= -1, not divisible by 6. Wait, n is natural number, so starting from 1. So n=1: (0)(2)=0, which is divisible by 6, and 0 is divisible by 6. So in all cases where the product is divisible by 6, at least one factor is divisible by 6. Therefore, k=6 is okay.Wait, but why? Because 6 is 2*3, which are primes. Wait, but 8 is 2^3. So maybe the problem is with prime powers? Wait, in the case of k=4, we saw that even though 4 is a prime power, Adam's conclusion still held. Wait, no, earlier when k=4, we saw that if the product is divisible by 4, then one of the factors must be divisible by 4. So maybe prime powers are okay? But then for k=8, we had a problem. So k=8 is 2^3. Hmm.Wait, let's test k=9. Let's see if there exists an n such that 9 divides (n-1)(n+1) but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 9. Let's take n=5. (4)(6)=24, not divisible by 9. n=4: (3)(5)=15, no. n=7: (6)(8)=48, no. n=8: (7)(9)=63. 63 is divisible by 9. Here, n+1=9 is divisible by 9. So Adam's conclusion holds. n=10: (9)(11)=99, divisible by 9. n-1=9 is divisible by 9. What about n=5: (4)(6)=24, not divisible by 9. n=14: (13)(15)=195, 195 divided by 9 is 21.666..., so not divisible. Wait, n= 10: (9)(11)=99, divisible by 9. So, seems like whenever 9 divides the product, one of the factors is divisible by 9. Wait, is that true?Wait, let's take n= 4 mod 9. Let n=4, then n-1=3, n+1=5. Product=15, not divisible by 9. If n=5, product=24, not divisible by 9. If n=1 mod 9: n=1, product=0*2=0, which is divisible by 9, and n-1=0. If n=2 mod 9: n=2, product=1*3=3, not divisible by 9. n=3 mod 9: n=3, product=2*4=8, not. n=4: 3*5=15. n=5:4*6=24. n=6:5*7=35. n=7:6*8=48. n=8:7*9=63. Here, 9 divides 63, and n+1=9 is divisible by 9. n=9:8*10=80, not divisible by 9. n=10:9*11=99, divisible by 9, and n-1=9. So it seems that for k=9, when the product is divisible by 9, then one of the factors is divisible by 9. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=9.Wait, but how? If k is a prime power, say p^m, then if p^m divides (n-1)(n+1), does it imply that p^m divides n-1 or n+1? For primes, we know that if p divides the product, it divides one of the factors. But for prime powers, it's not necessarily true. For example, 9=3^2. If 9 divides (n-1)(n+1), then 3 divides both n-1 and n+1? Wait, no. If 9 divides the product, then 3^2 divides (n-1)(n+1). Since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, they are coprime. Because the difference is 2, so any common divisor would divide 2. So if they share a common divisor, it's 1 or 2. But since they are two apart, if they are both even, they are coprime. Wait, no. If n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are even, so they are both divisible by 2, but their difference is 2, so gcd(n-1, n+1)= gcd(n-1, 2). If n-1 is even, then gcd(n-1,2)=2. So their gcd is 2. Therefore, if n is odd, the factors n-1 and n+1 are coprime except for a factor of 2.But if k is a prime power, say p^m, where p is an odd prime. Then, since n-1 and n+1 differ by 2, if p divides both, then p divides 2, so p=2. Therefore, for odd primes p, n-1 and n+1 are coprime. Therefore, if p^m divides (n-1)(n+1), and p is an odd prime, then p^m divides n-1 or p^m divides n+1. Because n-1 and n+1 are coprime. Therefore, for k being a power of an odd prime, Adam's conclusion holds.But for p=2, the factors n-1 and n+1 may share a common factor of 2. So, if k is a power of 2, say 2^m, then if 2^m divides (n-1)(n+1), must 2^m divide n-1 or n+1? Let's analyze this.If n is even, then both n-1 and n+1 are odd, so their product is odd, which is not divisible by 2. So the product is divisible by 2 only if n is odd. If n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are even, so their product is divisible by 4. Now, if m=1: 2 divides the product, which happens when n is odd. But n-1 and n+1 are both even, so 2 divides both. So Adam's conclusion holds because \\"either\\" includes both. If m=2: 4 divides the product. As we saw earlier, if n is 1 mod 4, then n-1 is 0 mod 4, so divisible by 4. If n is 3 mod 4, n+1 is 0 mod 4. Therefore, 4 divides one of the factors. Hence, Adam's conclusion holds. For m=3: 8 divides the product. Let's see. If n is 1 mod 8, then n-1=0 mod 8. If n is 7 mod 8, n+1=8 mod 8. But suppose n=3 mod 8. Then n-1=2 mod 8, n+1=4 mod 8. The product is 2*4=8 mod 8, so 8 divides the product. However, neither n-1=2 nor n+1=4 is divisible by 8. Hence, Adam's conclusion fails here. Therefore, for k=8, which is 2^3, there exists n (e.g., n=3) such that 8 divides (n-1)(n+1)=2*4=8, but neither 2 nor 4 is divisible by 8. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails.Similarly, for higher powers of 2. For example, k=16. Let's take n= 7. Then (6)(8)=48. 48 is divisible by 16? 48/16=3, so yes. 6 is not divisible by 16, 8 is not divisible by 16. So 16 divides the product, but neither factor is divisible by 16. Hence, Adam's conclusion fails.Therefore, for k being a power of 2, Adam's conclusion holds only when k is 1, 2, or 4. Wait, k=1 is trivial. For k=2: if n is odd, then both factors are even, so 2 divides both. For k=4: when n is odd, the product is divisible by 4, and one of the factors is divisible by 4. But for k=8, 16, etc., there are cases where the product is divisible by k, but neither factor is.Therefore, the key difference here is that when k is a power of 2 greater than or equal to 8, Adam's conclusion fails. For other prime powers (odd primes), Adam's conclusion holds because the factors are coprime. For composite numbers that are products of different primes, like 6=2*3, perhaps Adam's conclusion holds because of the coprimality.Wait, but let's check k=12. Let's see if there's an n where 12 divides (n-1)(n+1), but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 12. 12=4*3. Let's try n=5. (4)(6)=24, divisible by 12. n-1=4 not divisible by 12, n+1=6 not divisible by 12. So here, 24 is divisible by 12, but neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 12. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails for k=12. Hence, composite numbers that have multiple prime factors can fail.Wait, but why does 6 work? Let's take k=6 again. Let me try to find n such that (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 6. Let's take n=5: (4)(6)=24. 24 is divisible by 6, and n+1=6 is divisible by 6. So Adam's conclusion holds. n=7: (6)(8)=48 divisible by 6, n-1=6 is divisible by 6. n=4: (3)(5)=15, not divisible by 6. n=2: (1)(3)=3, not divisible by 6. n=3: (2)(4)=8, not divisible by 6. n=1: 0*2=0, which is divisible by 6, and n-1=0 is divisible by 6. So maybe for k=6, there is no n where the product is divisible by 6 but neither factor is. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds. Hmm.But why? For k=6, which is 2*3, if 6 divides (n-1)(n+1), then since 2 and 3 are coprime, 2 divides one factor and 3 divides the other. However, since n-1 and n+1 are two apart, if 2 divides one, the other is even or odd? Wait, if n is odd, then both n-1 and n+1 are even. If n is even, then both n-1 and n+1 are odd. So if 6 divides (n-1)(n+1), since 2 must divide the product, n must be odd, making both factors even. Then, 3 divides the product, so 3 divides either n-1 or n+1. So, if n is odd and 3 divides either n-1 or n+1, then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 6? Wait, no. Let's take n=5. n=5 is odd, n-1=4, which is divisible by 2 but not 3, and n+1=6, which is divisible by 3 and 2. So n+1 is divisible by 6. Similarly, n=7: n-1=6, which is divisible by 6. So in these cases, one of the factors is divisible by 6. If we take n=11: n-1=10 (divisible by 2 but not 3), n+1=12 (divisible by 6). So again, n+1 is divisible by 6. If n=9: n-1=8, n+1=10. (8)(10)=80, not divisible by 6. n=15: (14)(16)=224, not divisible by 6. Wait, 14*16=224. 224 divided by 6 is 37.333... So not divisible. Wait, perhaps if n is such that 3 divides one factor and 2 divides both, but 6 divides one factor. Let's see. Let n be odd. Then both factors are even. If 3 divides one of them, then that one is divisible by 6. So, in that case, one factor is divisible by 6. So if 6 divides the product, then since n is odd (as the product is even), one of the factors is even and divisible by 3, hence divisible by 6. Therefore, for k=6, Adam's conclusion holds.But for k=12, which is 4*3, we saw that n=5: product=24, divisible by 12, but neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 12. Wait, but 24 is divisible by 12, but n-1=4 and n+1=6. Neither 4 nor 6 is divisible by 12. So in this case, Adam's conclusion fails. So k=12 is invalid.So why does k=6 work but k=12 doesn't? Because 6 is a product of distinct primes, 2 and 3, each to the first power. But when we have higher exponents or composite exponents with multiple prime factors, like 12=4*3, then issues arise.So maybe the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, or an odd prime power? Wait, but when we checked k=9 (3^2), it worked. Let's check k=25. Let's see if 25 divides (n-1)(n+1) implies 25 divides n-1 or n+1. Suppose n= 1 mod 25. Then n-1=0 mod 25, so divisible by 25. If n=24 mod 25, then n+1=25 mod 25, divisible by 25. If n=13 mod 25, then n-1=12 mod 25, n+1=14 mod 25. Their product is 12*14=168 mod 25, which is 168-6*25=168-150=18 mod 25. Not divisible by 25. So 25 divides the product only if either n-1 or n+1 is 0 mod 25. Therefore, for k=25 (an odd prime power), Adam's conclusion holds. So for prime powers, even exponents greater than 1, if the prime is odd, Adam's conclusion holds.But for prime powers of 2, like 8, 16, etc., Adam's conclusion fails. So combining these observations, the natural numbers k for which Adam's reasoning is correct are:1. k=1 (trivial)2. k=23. k=44. Any prime power p^m where p is an odd prime and m ≥1But wait, let's confirm for another composite number. Let's take k=5*2=10. Let's see if there exists an n where 10 divides (n-1)(n+1) but neither n-1 nor n+1 is divisible by 10. Let's take n=5. Then (4)(6)=24, not divisible by 10. n=6: (5)(7)=35, not. n=9: (8)(10)=80. 80 is divisible by 10. Here, n+1=10 is divisible by 10. n=11: (10)(12)=120, divisible by 10, n-1=10. n=4: (3)(5)=15, not. n=14: (13)(15)=195, not divisible by 10. Wait, let's take n=3: (2)(4)=8. n=7: (6)(8)=48, not divisible by 10. Hmm, maybe n= 15: (14)(16)=224, which is 224 divided by 10 is 22.4, so not. Wait, n=25: (24)(26)=624, which is divisible by 10? 624/10=62.4, no. Wait, perhaps n=21: (20)(22)=440. 440 is divisible by 10. Here, n-1=20 is divisible by 10. So, in this case, Adam's conclusion holds. Let's try n= 5 mod 10: n=5: product=4*6=24. Not divisible by 10. n=15: product=14*16=224. 224/10=22.4. n=25:24*26=624. 624/10=62.4. Not divisible. Wait, how about n= 9: product=8*10=80. 80 is divisible by 10, and 10 is divisible by 10. n=19: 18*20=360, divisible by 10. 20 is divisible by 10. So it seems that whenever 10 divides the product, one of the factors is divisible by 10. Wait, is that true? Let's suppose that 10 divides (n-1)(n+1). Since 10=2*5, and n-1 and n+1 are two apart. If n is even, then both n-1 and n+1 are odd, so 2 doesn't divide the product. Therefore, n must be odd. Therefore, n-1 and n+1 are both even, so 2 divides both. Then, 5 divides the product, so 5 divides either n-1 or n+1. So, n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 5. Since n is odd, if n-1 is divisible by 5, then n-1 is even and divisible by 5, so divisible by 10. Similarly, if n+1 is divisible by 5, then n+1 is even and divisible by 5, so divisible by 10. Therefore, in either case, the factor divisible by 5 is also even, hence divisible by 10. Therefore, for k=10, Adam's conclusion holds.Wait, but this contradicts the earlier example where k=12. Wait, for k=12, let's analyze similarly. 12=4*3. If 12 divides (n-1)(n+1), then 4 divides the product and 3 divides the product. For 3 to divide the product, 3 divides either n-1 or n+1. For 4 to divide the product, since n must be odd (if n is even, both n-1 and n+1 are odd, so product is odd, not divisible by 4). So n is odd, so n-1 and n+1 are even. To have 4 divide the product, at least one of the factors must be divisible by 4. So if 4 divides n-1 or n+1, and 3 divides n-1 or n+1. If 4 and 3 divide different factors, then the factor divisible by 3 is only divisible by 2, so not by 6, but since it's divisible by 3 and 2, it's divisible by 6. Wait, no. Let's take n=5: n-1=4 (divisible by 4), n+1=6 (divisible by 6). So product is 24, divisible by 12. Here, n+1=6 is divisible by 6, which is a multiple of both 2 and 3, but not 12. However, since 4 divides n-1=4 and 3 divides n+1=6, the product is divisible by 4*3=12. However, neither factor is divisible by 12. Wait, but n-1=4 is divisible by 4, and n+1=6 is divisible by 6. So Adam's conclusion requires that either factor is divisible by 12. But in this case, neither is. So Adam's conclusion fails.Therefore, for k=12, even though 12 divides the product, neither factor is divisible by 12, hence Adam's conclusion fails.But why does k=10 work? For k=10=2*5. If 10 divides the product, since 2 and 5 are coprime, 2 divides one factor and 5 divides the other, but since n is odd (as product must be even), both factors are even. Therefore, if 5 divides one factor, that factor is even and divisible by 5, hence divisible by 10. So for k=10, Adam's conclusion holds.Ah, so the difference is that in k=10, the prime factors 2 and 5 are such that one of the factors must be divisible by both 2 and 5, making it divisible by 10. But in k=12=4*3, the factor divisible by 3 might only be divisible by 2 and 3, not 4 and 3. Hence, not divisible by 12.Therefore, maybe the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, or an odd prime power, or a product of 2 and an odd prime (like 6, 10, 14, etc.), but wait, but when we take k=6=2*3, it works. Wait, but k=10=2*5 works, but k=12=4*3 doesn't. Hmm. So what's the pattern here?Wait, maybe k must be of the form 1, 2, 4, or p^m, where p is an odd prime, or 2*p^m where p is an odd prime. Wait, but let's check. For k=6=2*3, which is 2*3^1, it works. For k=10=2*5, it works. For k=14=2*7, let's test. Suppose k=14. Let's see if whenever 14 divides (n-1)(n+1), then either n-1 or n+1 is divisible by 14. Let's assume 14 divides the product. Then 2 and 7 divide the product. Since n must be odd (as product must be even), both n-1 and n+1 are even. 7 divides either n-1 or n+1. If 7 divides n-1, then since n-1 is even, n-1 is divisible by 14. Similarly, if 7 divides n+1, then n+1 is even, hence divisible by 14. Therefore, in either case, the factor divisible by 7 is also divisible by 2, so divisible by 14. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds for k=14. So 2*p where p is an odd prime seems okay.But in the case of k=12=4*3, it's different because 4 is a higher power of 2. So, perhaps the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, or a product of an odd prime power and 1 or 2. Wait, more precisely, k can be:1. 1, 2, 4,2. Any prime power p^m where p is an odd prime,3. Twice an odd prime power, 2*p^m, where p is an odd prime.But when we tested k=6=2*3, which is 2*3^1, it worked. Similarly, k=10=2*5 works, k=14=2*7 works. But if we take k=2*3^2=18. Let's test k=18. Suppose (n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 18. Then 2 and 9 divide the product. Since n must be odd (to have the product even), both factors are even. 9 divides either n-1 or n+1. If 9 divides n-1, then since n-1 is even, n-1 is divisible by 2 and 9, hence by 18. Similarly, if 9 divides n+1, then n+1 is even, so divisible by 18. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds. Therefore, k=2*3^2=18 is okay.Similarly, k=2*5^2=50. If 50 divides (n-1)(n+1), then 2 and 25 divide the product. Since n must be odd, both factors are even. 25 divides one of them. If 25 divides n-1, then n-1 is even and divisible by 25, so divisible by 50. Similarly for n+1. Hence, Adam's conclusion holds.However, if k has multiple prime factors, say k=2*3*5=30. Let's test k=30. Suppose 30 divides (n-1)(n+1). Then 2, 3, and 5 divide the product. Since n must be odd, both factors are even. 3 divides one factor, 5 divides the other. If 3 divides n-1 and 5 divides n+1, then n-1 is divisible by 2 and 3, so divisible by 6, and n+1 is divisible by 2 and 5, so divisible by 10. Neither may be divisible by 30. For example, take n=16: n-1=15 (divisible by 15=3*5), n+1=17. But wait, n=16 is even, so n-1=15, n+1=17. The product is 15*17=255, which is not divisible by 30. Let me find a suitable n. Let's take n=31. Then n-1=30, divisible by 30. n+1=32. Product=30*32=960, which is divisible by 30. Here, n-1=30 is divisible by 30. What about n=25: (24)(26)=624. 624 divided by 30 is 20.8, so not divisible. n=29: (28)(30)=840, divisible by 30. Here, n+1=30 is divisible by 30. n=11: (10)(12)=120. 120 divisible by 30? No, 120/30=4. So 120 is divisible by 30? Wait, 30*4=120, so yes. Here, n=11: (10)(12)=120. 10 is divisible by 10, 12 is divisible by 12. Neither is divisible by 30. So 120 is divisible by 30, but neither 10 nor 12 is divisible by 30. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails for k=30. Hence, composite k with multiple distinct prime factors may fail.Therefore, the earlier idea that k can be 1,2,4, or twice an odd prime power, or an odd prime power, is still not entirely correct because when k has multiple distinct prime factors beyond 2 and another prime, like k=30=2*3*5, then Adam's conclusion fails.Wait, so perhaps the answer is that k must be 1, 2, 4, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power. Because in such cases, if k divides (n-1)(n+1), then since k is either a prime power or twice a prime power, the factors n-1 and n+1 must be coprime except for a factor of 2. Therefore, if k is a prime power (including 2^1 and 2^2), or twice an odd prime power, then Adam's conclusion holds.Wait, let's check k=12=4*3. 4 is 2^2, 3 is a prime. So k=12=2^2*3. But earlier, we saw that k=12 doesn't work. Similarly, k=30=2*3*5 doesn't work. Therefore, the only valid k's are:1. 1, 2, 4,2. Any odd prime power,3. Twice any odd prime power.Because in these cases, the factors n-1 and n+1 are either coprime or share only a factor of 2. If k is an odd prime power, then n-1 and n+1 are coprime, so k must divide one of them. If k is twice an odd prime power, then since n must be odd (to have even factors), one factor is divisible by 2 and the other is not. Since the odd prime power divides the product, it must divide one of the factors. If it divides the even factor, then that factor is divisible by 2 and the odd prime power, hence divisible by twice the prime power. If it divides the other factor, which is odd, then since the other factor is coprime to the even factor, but the 2 is already in the even factor, hence the odd factor is divisible by the odd prime power. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.Let me try with k=2*p^m where p is an odd prime. For example, k=2*3=6, k=2*9=18. Let's take k=18. Suppose 18 divides (n-1)(n+1). Then 2 and 9 divide the product. Since 2 divides the product, n must be odd. So both n-1 and n+1 are even. 9 divides the product, so 9 divides either n-1 or n+1. If 9 divides n-1, then since n-1 is even, 18 divides n-1. Similarly, if 9 divides n+1, then 18 divides n+1. Therefore, Adam's conclusion holds. Therefore, k=2*p^m works.However, if k has more than one distinct prime factor beyond 2, like k=2*3*5=30, then even if n is odd, and 3 and 5 divide different factors, then neither factor is divisible by 30, hence Adam's conclusion fails. Therefore, k must not have more than one distinct prime factor aside from possibly 2. So, k can be:- 1,- 2, 4 (which are powers of 2),- An odd prime power p^m,- Twice an odd prime power 2*p^m.This seems to cover the cases where Adam's conclusion holds. Let's verify with k=12=4*3. Since 4 is 2^2, which is a power of 2, and 3 is an odd prime, but k=12 is not a prime power nor twice a prime power. Therefore, Adam's conclusion fails. For k=6=2*3, which is twice a prime power (since 3 is prime), it works. For k=18=2*9=2*3^2, which is twice a prime power, it works. For k=50=2*25=2*5^2, it works. But for k=30=2*3*5, which is not a prime power nor twice a prime power, Adam's conclusion fails.Therefore, the natural numbers k for which Adam's reasoning is correct are exactly the numbers that are either:1. 1,2. 2,3. 4,4. An odd prime power (p^m where p is an odd prime and m ≥1),5. Twice an odd prime power (2*p^m where p is an odd prime and m ≥1).Now, let's confirm if these are the only possibilities. For example, k=8=2^3. Earlier, we saw that Adam's conclusion fails for k=8. So 8 is a power of 2 higher than 4, so not included, and indeed, it fails. For k=16=2^4, same problem. For k=3^2=9, which is an odd prime power, it works. For k=2*3=6, which is twice an odd prime, works. k=2*9=18, works. k=2*25=50, works. So the pattern holds.Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers k that are either 1, 2, 4, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( k ) are 1, 2, 4, and those that are an odd prime power or twice an odd prime power. Thus, the solution is (boxed{k}) where ( k ) is 1, 2, 4, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power.However, since the problem asks to determine all natural numbers ( k ) and present them in boxed notation, typically such answers in Olympiad problems are presented as specific numbers or a characterization. Since the characterization is a set, we need to express it as:All natural numbers ( k ) that are either ( 1 ), ( 2 ), ( 4 ), an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power. But since the answer requires putting the final answer in a box and the problem is likely expecting a specific description rather than a set, the standard way is to describe it as:boxed{1}, boxed{2}, boxed{4}, and all odd prime powers and twice odd prime powers.But in the required format, since it's a single box, perhaps the answer is the set of all such k described, which can be written as:boxed{k text{ is } 1, 2, 4, text{ an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power}}.But the standard might expect a more concise mathematical characterization. Let me check the problem statement: \\"Determine all natural numbers k for which Adam's reasoning is correct for every natural n.\\"Therefore, the answer should be the set of all natural numbers k such that k is 1, 2, 4, an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power. In boxed form, since it's a single answer, written in words:boxed{k text{ is } 1, 2, 4, text{ an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power}}Alternatively, if the problem expects a different notation, but given the original problem's wording, this is the accurate answer.</think>To determine all natural numbers ( k ) for which Adam's reasoning is correct, we need to ensure that whenever ((n-1)(n+1)) is divisible by ( k ), at least one of ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) must be divisible by ( k ) for every natural number ( n ).1. Prime Numbers: For any prime ( p ), if ( p ) divides ((n-1)(n+1)), it must divide either ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ). This holds because primes are irreducible.2. Prime Powers (Odd Primes): For an odd prime power ( p^m ), if ( p^m ) divides ((n-1)(n+1)), since ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are coprime (they differ by 2), ( p^m ) must divide one of them.3. Powers of 2: For ( k = 2 ), if ( 2 ) divides ((n-1)(n+1)), then ( n ) must be odd, making both ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) even. For ( k = 4 ), if ( 4 ) divides ((n-1)(n+1)), then one of ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) must be divisible by 4. However, higher powers of 2 (e.g., 8, 16) fail because they can divide the product without dividing either factor.4. Twice an Odd Prime Power: For ( k = 2 times p^m ) (where ( p ) is an odd prime), if ( k ) divides ((n-1)(n+1)), then ( n ) must be odd, making both factors even. The odd prime power ( p^m ) must divide one of the factors, which will then be divisible by ( 2 times p^m ).5. Composite Numbers with Multiple Prime Factors: These fail because they can divide the product without dividing either factor (e.g., ( k = 12 )).Thus, the natural numbers ( k ) for which Adam's reasoning is correct are:- ( k = 1 )- ( k = 2 )- ( k = 4 )- Any odd prime power- Twice any odd prime power[boxed{k text{ is } 1, 2, 4, text{ an odd prime power, or twice an odd prime power}}]]"},{"problem":"5.

The capacity is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in a subset. Alright, let's start by understanding what exactly is being asked here.First, let's parse the problem. For every subset of M that has exactly r elements, we calculate the capacity (which is max - min), and then we take the average of all these capacities. That average is F(n, r). So, my task is to compute this average value.Given that the problem is about averages over all subsets, it's likely that we can find a clever way to compute this without enumerating all subsets, which would be computationally intensive, especially since n and r can be large. Probably, there's some combinatorial approach or symmetry we can exploit here.Let me recall that when dealing with averages over subsets, sometimes it's helpful to consider linearity of expectation. That is, instead of computing the average directly, we can model the process as selecting a random r-element subset and then compute the expected value of its capacity. The expected value (or expectation) is essentially the arithmetic mean over all possible subsets.So, let me reframe the problem in terms of expectation. Let’s consider a randomly selected r-element subset S from M. Then F(n, r) is equal to E[max(S) - min(S)], where E denotes expectation. Therefore, F(n, r) = E[max(S)] - E[min(S)].This seems promising because maybe we can compute E[max(S)] and E[min(S)] separately and then subtract them. I remember that for expectations of order statistics (like the expectation of the maximum or minimum of a sample), there are known formulas. Let me recall those.For a uniform random sample without replacement from a discrete uniform distribution on {1, 2, ..., n}, the expected value of the maximum in the sample can be calculated. Similarly for the minimum. I need to figure out these expectations.Let me start by trying to find E[max(S)] for a random r-element subset S.Suppose we have the set M = {1, 2, ..., n}. Let’s denote X as the maximum of a randomly chosen r-element subset S. Then, we need to compute E[X].To compute E[X], we can use the formula for expectation: E[X] = sum_{k=1}^n k * P(X = k). So, we need the probability that the maximum element in S is k, for each k from 1 to n.But if k is the maximum in S, then all other elements of S must be less than k. So, the number of subsets with maximum k is C(k-1, r-1), where C denotes combination. Because we need to choose r-1 elements from the first k-1 elements, and then include k.The total number of r-element subsets is C(n, r). Therefore, P(X = k) = C(k-1, r-1)/C(n, r).Therefore, E[X] = sum_{k=r}^n [k * C(k-1, r-1)] / C(n, r).Wait, the smallest possible maximum is r, because if you have an r-element subset, the maximum can't be less than r (since the elements are 1, 2, ..., n). For example, if r=2, the smallest maximum is 2 (subset {1,2}), then 3, etc. So, the sum starts at k=r.Similarly, the same logic applies for the minimum. Let's denote Y as the minimum of the subset S. Then, E[Y] = sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} [k * C(n - k, r - 1)] / C(n, r).Wait, let me check that. If Y is the minimum of S, then for Y = k, all other elements of S must be greater than k. So, the number of subsets with minimum k is C(n - k, r - 1), because we need to choose r-1 elements from {k+1, ..., n}. Therefore, the probability P(Y = k) = C(n - k, r - 1)/C(n, r).But the minimum can range from 1 up to n - r + 1. For example, if n=5 and r=3, the minimum can be 1, 2, or 3. Because if the minimum is 3, the subset must be {3,4,5}. So, indeed, the maximum possible minimum is n - r + 1.Therefore, E[Y] = sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} [k * C(n - k, r - 1)] / C(n, r).So, now, we have expressions for both E[X] and E[Y], and F(n, r) = E[X] - E[Y]. Therefore, we need to compute these two sums and subtract them.But these sums might have closed-form expressions. Let me see if I can find a formula for E[X] and E[Y].Starting with E[X]. Let's denote E[X] = (1 / C(n, r)) * sum_{k=r}^n k * C(k - 1, r - 1).Let me consider the term k * C(k - 1, r - 1). Note that C(k - 1, r - 1) = (k - 1)! / [(r - 1)! (k - r)!]. Then, k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = k * (k - 1)! / [(r - 1)! (k - r)!] = k! / [(r - 1)! (k - r)!] = r * k! / [r! (k - r)!] ) = r * C(k, r).Wait, is that correct?Let me check:k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = k * [ (k - 1)! / ( (r - 1)! (k - 1 - (r - 1))! ) ) ] = k * [ (k - 1)! / ( (r - 1)! (k - r)! ) ) ] = k! / ( (r - 1)! (k - r)! ) )But C(k, r) = k! / ( r! (k - r)! )Therefore, k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = r * C(k, r)Because:r * C(k, r) = r * [k! / ( r! (k - r)! ) ] = k! / ( (r - 1)! (k - r)! ) ) = same as above.Therefore, k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = r * C(k, r).Therefore, the sum sum_{k=r}^n k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = r * sum_{k=r}^n C(k, r).So, sum_{k=r}^n C(k, r) = C(r, r) + C(r + 1, r) + ... + C(n, r).But there is a combinatorial identity that states that sum_{k=r}^n C(k, r) = C(n + 1, r + 1). Let me verify this.Yes, this is the hockey-stick identity or Christmas stocking theorem. The sum of C(k, r) from k=r to n is equal to C(n + 1, r + 1). So, this holds.Therefore, sum_{k=r}^n k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = r * C(n + 1, r + 1).Therefore, E[X] = [ r * C(n + 1, r + 1) ] / C(n, r )Simplify this expression:C(n + 1, r + 1) = (n + 1)! / [ (r + 1)! (n - r)! ) ]C(n, r) = n! / [ r! (n - r)! )Therefore, E[X] = [ r * (n + 1)! / ( (r + 1)! (n - r)! ) ) ] / [ n! / ( r! (n - r)! ) ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: r * (n + 1)! / ( (r + 1)! (n - r)! )Denominator: n! / ( r! (n - r)! )So, E[X] = [ r * (n + 1)! / ( (r + 1)! (n - r)! ) ) ] * [ r! (n - r)! ) / n! ]Simplify terms:(n + 1)! / n! = n + 1r! / (r + 1)! = 1 / (r + 1)The (n - r)! cancels out.Therefore, E[X] = r * (n + 1) * (1 / (r + 1)) ) = [ r (n + 1) ] / (r + 1 )So, E[X] = r(n + 1)/(r + 1)Wait, that's a neat result. So, the expected maximum of a random r-element subset is r(n + 1)/(r + 1). Let me verify this with a small example to be sure.Take n = 2, r = 2. Then M = {1, 2}. The only subset is {1, 2}, so the maximum is 2. E[X] should be 2.Plug into the formula: r(n + 1)/(r + 1) = 2*(2 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 6/3 = 2. Correct.Another example: n = 3, r = 2. The subsets are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. The maxima are 2, 3, 3. The average maximum is (2 + 3 + 3)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...Formula: 2*(3 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 8/3 ≈ 2.666... Correct. That matches. So, the formula seems to hold.Similarly, let's check E[X] for n = 4, r = 2. Subsets:{1,2} max=2; {1,3}=3; {1,4}=4; {2,3}=3; {2,4}=4; {3,4}=4.Maxima: 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4. Sum = 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 20. Average = 20/6 ≈ 3.333...Formula: 2*(4 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 10/3 ≈ 3.333... Correct.Okay, so the formula for E[X] is verified.Now, let's move on to E[Y], the expectation of the minimum.Similarly, for E[Y] = sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} [k * C(n - k, r - 1) ] / C(n, r)Let me try to find a similar simplification for this sum.First, let's note that C(n - k, r - 1) is the number of subsets where the minimum is k. So, similar to the maximum, we can think of k * C(n - k, r - 1) summed over k, divided by C(n, r).But perhaps there's a way to relate this sum to another combination formula.Alternatively, maybe we can use symmetry. Notice that the problem is symmetric with respect to the ordering of the elements. If we reverse the ordering of the set M (i.e., map each element i to n + 1 - i), then the minimum of the original set becomes the maximum of the transformed set, and vice versa.Therefore, perhaps E[Y] can be related to E[X] in some transformed set.Let me consider that. If we define a bijection between subsets of M and their \\"complements\\" with respect to the reversed set, then the minimum of a subset corresponds to the maximum of the complementary subset in the reversed set.Wait, perhaps more precisely, if we reverse the ordering, the minimum element k in the original set corresponds to the maximum element (n + 1 - k) in the reversed set. So, for each subset S with minimum k, the subset S' = {n + 1 - s | s ∈ S} has maximum n + 1 - k.Therefore, there is a duality between minimum and maximum through this reversal.Given that the original set M is symmetric, the distribution of the minimum over r-element subsets is the same as the distribution of (n + 1 - maximum) over r-element subsets of the reversed set. But since the set is just {1, 2, ..., n}, which is symmetric under this reversal, the distribution of the minimum in M is the same as the distribution of (n + 1 - maximum) in M.Therefore, E[Y] = n + 1 - E[X'] where X' is the maximum of a random r-element subset of the reversed set. But since the reversed set is just M itself (as a set, order doesn't matter for subsets), the distribution of X' is the same as the distribution of the maximum. Wait, but the maximum in the reversed set would correspond to n + 1 - min in the original set. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting tangled.Alternatively, perhaps we can use a similar technique as with the maximum. Let's try to compute E[Y] directly.E[Y] = sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} [k * C(n - k, r - 1) ] / C(n, r)Let me make a substitution. Let m = n - k. When k = 1, m = n - 1. When k = n - r + 1, m = r - 1. Wait, but the sum over k from 1 to n - r + 1 becomes a sum over m from n - 1 down to r - 1. Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let’s set j = k - 1. Then, when k=1, j=0; when k = n - r + 1, j = n - r. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, let's note that C(n - k, r - 1) is the number of ways to choose r - 1 elements from the upper n - k elements (i.e., elements greater than k). So, similar to the maximum case, but mirrored.Wait, let's consider changing variables. Let’s let l = n + 1 - k. Then, k = n + 1 - l. When k ranges from 1 to n - r + 1, l ranges from n down to r + 1 - 1 = r. Wait, n - (n - r + 1) + 1 = r. So, l ranges from n down to r. So, reversing the order.Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} k * C(n - k, r - 1) = sum_{l=r}^n (n + 1 - l) * C(l - 1, r - 1)Because when k = 1, l = n; when k = n - r + 1, l = r. So, reversing the sum:= sum_{l=r}^n (n + 1 - l) * C(l - 1, r - 1)Which can be split into two sums:= (n + 1) sum_{l=r}^n C(l - 1, r - 1) - sum_{l=r}^n l * C(l - 1, r - 1)But we already know from the maximum case that sum_{l=r}^n C(l - 1, r - 1) = C(n, r)Wait, hold on: sum_{l=r}^n C(l - 1, r - 1) = C(n, r). Is that true?Wait, let's check. For example, sum_{l=r}^n C(l - 1, r - 1) = C(r - 1, r - 1) + C(r, r - 1) + ... + C(n - 1, r - 1). Which is equal to sum_{k=r - 1}^{n - 1} C(k, r - 1). Then, using the hockey-stick identity, this is equal to C(n, r). Yes, because sum_{k=0}^m C(k, t) = C(m + 1, t + 1). So, sum_{k=r - 1}^{n - 1} C(k, r - 1) = C(n, r). Therefore, the first sum is C(n, r).Similarly, the second sum is sum_{l=r}^n l * C(l - 1, r - 1). Wait, this is similar to the expression we had for the maximum. From before, we saw that sum_{k=r}^n k * C(k - 1, r - 1) = r * C(n + 1, r + 1). Therefore, sum_{l=r}^n l * C(l - 1, r - 1) = r * C(n + 1, r + 1)Therefore, putting it all together:sum_{k=1}^{n - r + 1} k * C(n - k, r - 1) = (n + 1) * C(n, r) - r * C(n + 1, r + 1)Therefore, E[Y] = [ (n + 1) * C(n, r) - r * C(n + 1, r + 1) ] / C(n, r)Simplify this expression:First term: (n + 1) * C(n, r) / C(n, r) = n + 1Second term: - r * C(n + 1, r + 1) / C(n, r)Compute C(n + 1, r + 1) / C(n, r):C(n + 1, r + 1) = (n + 1)! / [ (r + 1)! (n - r)! ) ]C(n, r) = n! / [ r! (n - r)! )Therefore, their ratio is [ (n + 1)! / ( (r + 1)! (n - r)! ) ] / [ n! / ( r! (n - r)! ) ] = (n + 1) / (r + 1)Therefore, the second term is - r * (n + 1)/(r + 1)Putting it all together:E[Y] = (n + 1) - [ r(n + 1)/(r + 1) ] = (n + 1)(1 - r/(r + 1)) = (n + 1)/(r + 1)Therefore, E[Y] = (n + 1)/(r + 1)Wait, that's interesting. So, the expectation of the minimum is (n + 1)/(r + 1). Let's verify this with an example.Take n = 3, r = 2. The subsets are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. The minima are 1, 1, 2. The average minimum is (1 + 1 + 2)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...Formula: (3 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333... Correct.Another example: n = 4, r = 2. The subsets:{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}Minima: 1,1,1,2,2,3. Sum = 1+1+1+2+2+3 = 10. Average = 10/6 ≈ 1.666...Formula: (4 + 1)/(2 + 1) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666... Correct.Another test case: n=2, r=2. The only subset {1,2}, minimum is 1. Formula: (2+1)/(2+1)=1. Correct.Okay, so the formula for E[Y] = (n + 1)/(r + 1). Therefore, F(n, r) = E[X] - E[Y] = [ r(n + 1)/(r + 1) ] - [ (n + 1)/(r + 1) ] = [ (r - 1)(n + 1) ] / (r + 1 )Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.E[X] = r(n + 1)/(r + 1)E[Y] = (n + 1)/(r + 1)Therefore, F(n, r) = E[X] - E[Y] = [r(n + 1) - (n + 1)] / (r + 1) = (n + 1)(r - 1)/(r + 1)Therefore, F(n, r) = (n + 1)(r - 1)/(r + 1)But let me verify this with the earlier examples.First example: n=3, r=2.Earlier, we found E[X] = 8/3 ≈ 2.666..., E[Y] = 4/3 ≈ 1.333..., so F(n, r) = 8/3 - 4/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...Using the formula: (3 + 1)(2 - 1)/(2 + 1) = 4*1/3 = 4/3. Correct.Another example: n=4, r=2. E[X] = 10/3 ≈ 3.333..., E[Y] = 5/3 ≈ 1.666..., so F(n, r)=10/3 -5/3=5/3≈1.666...Formula: (4 +1)(2 -1)/(2 +1)=5*1/3=5/3. Correct.Another example: n=2, r=2. F(n, r)=2 -1=1. Formula: (2+1)(2-1)/(2+1)=3*1/3=1. Correct.Wait, so that works. So, in general, F(n, r)=(n +1)(r -1)/(r +1). But let me check another case to be sure.Take n=5, r=3. Let's compute E[X] and E[Y].E[X] = 3*(5 +1)/(3 +1)=18/4=4.5E[Y] = (5 +1)/(3 +1)=6/4=1.5Therefore, F(n, r)=4.5 -1.5=3.0Formula: (5 +1)(3 -1)/(3 +1)=6*2/4=12/4=3.0. Correct.Alternatively, let's compute manually for n=5, r=3. All 3-element subsets:{1,2,3}: capacity 2{1,2,4}: 3{1,2,5}:4{1,3,4}:3{1,3,5}:4{1,4,5}:4{2,3,4}:2{2,3,5}:3{2,4,5}:3{3,4,5}:2Total capacities: 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 30Number of subsets: C(5,3)=10. Therefore, average capacity=30/10=3.0. Which matches the formula. So, correct.Thus, the general formula is F(n, r) = (n + 1)(r - 1)/(r + 1)But let me check for r=1. Wait, but in the problem statement, r >=2. So, we don't have to worry about r=1. However, let's test with r=2, n=5. From the formula: (5 +1)(2 -1)/(2 +1)=6*1/3=2. Let's compute manually.For n=5, r=2. The capacities of all 2-element subsets:Each subset has capacity (j - i) where j > i. The average of (j - i) for all i < j.Total number of subsets: C(5,2)=10.Compute sum of capacities:1-2:11-3:21-4:31-5:42-3:12-4:22-5:33-4:13-5:24-5:1Sum:1+2+3+4+1+2+3+1+2+1=20Average:20/10=2. Which matches the formula. So, correct.Therefore, I can be confident that the formula F(n, r) = (n +1)(r -1)/(r +1) is correct.But let me check for another case, say n=4, r=3.Formula: (4 +1)(3 -1)/(3 +1)=5*2/4=10/4=2.5Manual calculation:Subsets of size 3:{1,2,3}: capacity 2{1,2,4}:3{1,3,4}:3{2,3,4}:2Sum:2+3+3+2=10Average:10/4=2.5. Correct.Hence, the formula holds.Therefore, the answer should be F(n, r) = dfrac{(n + 1)(r - 1)}{r + 1}Expressed as a box: boxed{dfrac{(n + 1)(r - 1)}{r + 1}}Final Answerboxed{dfrac{(n + 1)(r - 1)}{r + 1}}</think>To find ( F(n, r) ), the arithmetic mean of the capacities of all ( r )-element subsets of the set ( M = {1, 2, ldots, n} ), we need to compute the expected value of the capacity, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of a subset. First, we calculate the expected value of the maximum element ( E[text{max}(S)] ) for a random ( r )-element subset ( S ). Using combinatorial identities, we find:[E[text{max}(S)] = frac{r(n + 1)}{r + 1}]Next, we calculate the expected value of the minimum element ( E[text{min}(S)] ). By symmetry and similar combinatorial arguments, we find:[E[text{min}(S)] = frac{n + 1}{r + 1}]The capacity of a subset is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the capacities ( F(n, r) ) is given by:[F(n, r) = E[text{max}(S)] - E[text{min}(S)] = frac{r(n + 1)}{r + 1} - frac{n + 1}{r + 1} = frac{(n + 1)(r - 1)}{r + 1}]Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{dfrac{(n + 1)(r - 1)}{r + 1}}],<think>Okay, so I need to figure out the arithmetic mean of the capacities of all r-element subsets of the set M = {1, 2, ..., n}, where 2 ≤ r ≤ n. The capacity is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of a subset. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let me understand what exactly is being asked. For every possible subset of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, I have to compute the capacity (which is max - min) of that subset and then take the average of all those capacities. The question is asking for a formula for this average, F(n, r).Let me think about how subsets are structured. For any subset of size r, the elements are in increasing order, so the capacity is simply the last element minus the first element. So, maybe instead of looking at all subsets, I can consider all possible pairs of first and last elements where there are r-2 elements in between. Then, for each such pair, compute (last - first) and multiply by the number of subsets that have those as their first and last elements. Then sum all those values and divide by the total number of subsets, which is C(n, r).That seems like a plan. Let me formalize this.Let’s denote the first element as i and the last element as j, where i < j. For a subset of size r, there must be exactly r - 2 elements between i and j. So, the number of subsets with minimum i and maximum j is C(j - i - 1, r - 2). Because between i and j, there are (j - i - 1) elements, and we need to choose (r - 2) of them to complete the subset.Therefore, the total capacity contributed by all subsets with min i and max j is (j - i) * C(j - i - 1, r - 2). Then, the sum over all i < j of (j - i) * C(j - i - 1, r - 2). Then divide by C(n, r) to get the average.So, F(n, r) = [Σ (from i=1 to n) Σ (from j=i+1 to n) (j - i) * C(j - i - 1, r - 2)] / C(n, r)But this double summation might be complex. Let me see if I can simplify it.Notice that for each pair (i, j), the term (j - i) is the capacity, and C(j - i - 1, r - 2) is the number of subsets with min i and max j. So, the total sum can be rewritten by considering the difference d = j - i. Then, for each possible d, how many pairs (i, j) have j - i = d? For each d, the number of such pairs is (n - d), since i can range from 1 to n - d, and j = i + d.But also, for a given d, the number of subsets with min i and max j = i + d is C(d - 1, r - 2), provided that d - 1 ≥ r - 2, which implies d ≥ r - 1. Because between i and j, there are d - 1 elements, and we need to choose r - 2 of them. So, if d - 1 < r - 2, then C(d - 1, r - 2) is zero.Therefore, the sum becomes Σ (from d=1 to n-1) [ (n - d) * d * C(d - 1, r - 2) ].Wait, hold on. Wait, the term (j - i) is d, and for each d, there are (n - d) pairs (i, j) with j - i = d. For each such pair, the number of subsets is C(d - 1, r - 2). So, the total contribution for each d is (n - d) * d * C(d - 1, r - 2). So, the entire sum is the sum over d from 1 to n-1 of (n - d) * d * C(d - 1, r - 2). Then divide by C(n, r).But C(d - 1, r - 2) is non-zero only when d - 1 ≥ r - 2, i.e., d ≥ r - 1. Therefore, the sum can be rewritten as Σ (from d=r-1 to n-1) [ (n - d) * d * C(d - 1, r - 2) ] / C(n, r).Hmm, okay. So maybe we can make a substitution here. Let’s let k = d - (r - 1). So, when d = r - 1, k = 0; when d = n -1, k = (n -1) - (r -1) = n - r. So, then d = (r -1) + k, and substituting into the expression:Σ (from k=0 to n - r) [ (n - (r -1 + k)) * (r -1 + k) * C((r -1 + k) - 1, r - 2) ] / C(n, r)Simplifying the terms:n - (r -1 + k) = n - r +1 - k(r -1 + k) = r -1 + kC((r -1 + k) -1, r - 2) = C(r -2 + k, r -2) = C(r -2 + k, k)So, substituting:Σ [ (n - r +1 - k) * (r -1 + k) * C(r -2 + k, k) ] / C(n, r)But C(r -2 + k, k) = C(r -2 + k, r -2). Hmm, maybe there's a combinatorial identity that can help here.Alternatively, maybe we can manipulate the original sum.Wait, let me consider the sum S = Σ (from d=r-1 to n-1) [ (n - d) * d * C(d -1, r - 2) ]Let me write this as Σ [ (n - d) * d * C(d -1, r - 2) ] for d ≥ r -1.Let’s note that d * C(d -1, r -2) = r -1 * C(d, r -1). Because d * C(d -1, r -2) = d * ( (d -1)! / [(r -2)! (d -1 - (r -2))! ] ) ) = d! / [ (r -2)! (d - r +1)! ] ) = (r -1) * ( d! / [ (r -1)! (d - r +1)! ] ) ) = (r -1) * C(d, r -1)Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify with an example: let r=3, so r-1=2, r-2=1.Then, d * C(d -1, 1) = d * (d -1) = d(d -1). On the other hand, (r -1) * C(d, r -1) = 2 * C(d, 2) = 2 * d(d -1)/2 = d(d -1). So, yes, that identity holds.Therefore, S = Σ [ (n - d) * (r -1) * C(d, r -1) ] for d from r-1 to n-1.Factor out (r -1):S = (r -1) * Σ [ (n - d) * C(d, r -1) ] for d from r-1 to n-1.Hmm, now we have to compute Σ [ (n - d) * C(d, r -1) ].Let’s make a substitution. Let’s let m = d. Then, m ranges from r-1 to n-1. So, Σ [ (n - m) * C(m, r -1) ] from m=r-1 to n-1.Let’s split the term (n - m) * C(m, r -1) into n * C(m, r -1) - m * C(m, r -1).So, S = (r -1) * [ n * Σ C(m, r -1) - Σ m * C(m, r -1) ] from m=r-1 to n-1.Let’s compute these two sums separately.First sum: Σ C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1.We know that Σ (from m=k to N) C(m, k) = C(N +1, k +1). This is a known combinatorial identity. For example, the sum of combinations from k choose k up to N choose k is equal to (N +1 choose k +1). So here, k = r -1, N = n -1. Therefore, the first sum is C(n, r).Similarly, the second sum is Σ m * C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1.Let’s find an expression for Σ m * C(m, r -1). Let's recall that m * C(m, r -1) = r * C(m +1, r). Let me verify this:C(m +1, r) = (m +1)! / [ r! (m +1 - r)! ]Multiply by r: r * C(m +1, r) = r * (m +1)! / [ r! (m +1 - r)! ] = (m +1)! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ] )On the other hand, m * C(m, r -1) = m * [ m! / ( (r -1)! (m - (r -1))! ) ] = m * m! / [ (r -1)! (m - r +1)! ] = (m +1 -1) * m! / [ (r -1)! (m - r +1)! ] )But (m +1)! = (m +1) * m! So, (m +1)! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ] = (m +1) * m! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ]But m - r +1 = (m +1 - r). Therefore, (m +1)! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ] = (m +1) * m! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ]Comparing to m * C(m, r -1) = m * m! / [ (r -1)! (m - r +1)! ] = m * m! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ]Thus, r * C(m +1, r) = (m +1) * m! / [ (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ] = (m +1) * C(m, r -1)Therefore, m * C(m, r -1) = r * C(m +1, r) - C(m, r -1). Hmm, maybe my initial thought was a bit off.Wait, let's check for a specific value. Let m=3, r=3. Then m * C(m, r-1) = 3 * C(3,2) = 3*3=9. r * C(m+1, r) = 3*C(4,3)=3*4=12. So 9 ≠ 12. So the identity is not exactly that. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, note that m * C(m, r -1) = r * C(m +1, r). Wait, let's check with m=3, r=3. Then, r * C(m +1, r) = 3 * C(4,3)=12. But m * C(m, r -1)=3*C(3,2)=9. Not equal. So, maybe this is not the correct identity.Wait, perhaps m * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r). Let's check that. For m=3, r=3: (3 -1)*C(4,3)=2*4=8. Still not 9. Hmm, not matching.Alternatively, maybe m * C(m, r -1) = (r) * C(m, r). Let's check. For m=3, r=3: 3*C(3,2)=9 vs 3*C(3,3)=3*1=3. No. Not that either.Wait, perhaps integrating or differentiating the generating function. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, note that m * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r). Wait, check with m=3, r=3: (3 -1)*C(4,3)=2*4=8. Still not 9. Hmm. Maybe not.Wait, let's compute m * C(m, r -1):= m * [ m! / ( (r -1)! (m - (r -1))! ) ]= m * m! / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! )= (m +1 -1) * m! / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! )= [ (m +1)! - m! ] / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! )But that doesn't seem helpful.Alternatively, express m * C(m, r -1) as (r -1) * C(m +1, r). Let's check:(r -1) * C(m +1, r) = (r -1) * (m +1)! / ( r! (m +1 - r)! ) )= (m +1)! / ( (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ) )Which is equal to m * C(m, r -1):m * C(m, r -1) = m * m! / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! )But (m +1)! = (m +1) * m!So, (m +1)! / ( (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ) = (m +1) * m! / ( (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! )Comparing to m * C(m, r -1) = m * m! / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! )Note that (m +1 - r)! = (m - r +1)! So the denominators are the same. So:(m +1)! / ( (r -1)! (m +1 - r)! ) = (m +1) * m! / ( (r -1)! (m - r +1)! ) = (m +1) * C(m, r -1)Therefore, (r -1) * C(m +1, r) = (m +1) * C(m, r -1). Therefore,m * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r) - C(m, r -1)Wait, let's see:From above, (m +1) * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r)Thus, m * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r) - C(m, r -1)Yes, because (m +1) * C(m, r -1) - C(m, r -1) = m * C(m, r -1)Therefore,m * C(m, r -1) = (r -1) * C(m +1, r) - C(m, r -1)Therefore, Σ (from m=r-1 to n-1) [ m * C(m, r -1) ] = Σ [ (r -1) * C(m +1, r) - C(m, r -1) ] from m=r-1 to n-1= (r -1) * Σ C(m +1, r) from m=r-1 to n-1 - Σ C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1Let’s compute each term.First term: (r -1) * Σ C(m +1, r) from m=r-1 to n-1. Let’s change variables: let k = m +1. Then, when m=r-1, k=r; when m=n-1, k=n. Therefore, this sum becomes (r -1) * Σ C(k, r) from k=r to n.Similarly, the second term: Σ C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1 is equal to C(n, r), as we saw earlier.So, Σ [ m * C(m, r -1) ] = (r -1) * [ C(n +1, r +1) - C(r, r +1) ] - C(n, r)But wait, Σ C(k, r) from k=r to n is equal to C(n +1, r +1). Because the sum of C(k, r) from k=r to n is C(n +1, r +1). That's the same identity as before.But C(r, r +1) is zero because you can't choose r +1 elements from r. So, Σ C(k, r) from k=r to n = C(n +1, r +1). Therefore, the first term is (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1). The second term is - C(n, r).Therefore, Σ [ m * C(m, r -1) ] = (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r)So, going back to S:S = (r -1) * [ n * C(n, r) - ( (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r) ) ) ]Wait, let's recall S was:S = (r -1) * [ n * Σ C(m, r -1) - Σ m * C(m, r -1) ]Which we found to be:S = (r -1) * [ n * C(n, r) - ( (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r) ) ) ]Simplify inside the brackets:n * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) + C(n, r)= (n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1)But C(n, r) = C(n, n - r). Hmm, not sure. Let's compute it step by step.Wait, (n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1)But C(n +1, r +1) = C(n, r +1) + C(n, r). Wait, Pascal's identity: C(n +1, k) = C(n, k) + C(n, k -1). So, perhaps that's not directly helpful here.Alternatively, express C(n +1, r +1) in terms of C(n, r):C(n +1, r +1) = (n +1)! / [ (r +1)! (n - r)! ] )= (n +1) / (r +1) * C(n, r)Therefore, (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) = (r -1) * (n +1)/(r +1) * C(n, r)So, substituting back into the expression:(n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * (n +1)/(r +1) * C(n, r)= (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ 1 - (r -1)/(r +1) ]= (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ (r +1 - (r -1)) / (r +1) ]= (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ 2 / (r +1) ]= 2(n +1) * C(n, r) / (r +1)Therefore, S = (r -1) * [ 2(n +1) * C(n, r) / (r +1) ]Wait, but this seems like an error. Wait, let's step back.Wait, the expression was S = (r -1) * [ (n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) ]Wait, no, the previous steps:Original expression:S = (r -1) * [ n * C(n, r) - ( (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r) ) ]= (r -1) * [ n * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) + C(n, r) ]= (r -1) * [ (n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) ]Then, substituting C(n +1, r +1) = (n +1)/(r +1) * C(n, r):= (r -1) * [ (n +1) * C(n, r) - (r -1) * (n +1)/(r +1) * C(n, r) ]= (r -1) * (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ 1 - (r -1)/(r +1) ]= (r -1) * (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ (r +1 - r +1)/ (r +1) ]= (r -1) * (n +1) * C(n, r) * [ 2 / (r +1) ]= (r -1) * 2(n +1) / (r +1) * C(n, r )Therefore, S = 2(r -1)(n +1) / (r +1) * C(n, r )Therefore, the total sum S is 2(r -1)(n +1) / (r +1) * C(n, r )Then, F(n, r) = S / C(n, r) = [ 2(r -1)(n +1) / (r +1) * C(n, r ) ] / C(n, r ) = 2(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1)Wait, that seems surprisingly simple. Let me check if this makes sense.Let’s test with a small example. Let n=3, r=2. Then the subsets of size 2 are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. Their capacities are 1, 2, 1. The average is (1 + 2 +1)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...Compute the formula: 2(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1) = 2(2 -1)(3 +1)/(2 +1) = 2*1*4/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666... Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so something is wrong here.Wait, this suggests that my final answer is incorrect. So, there must be a mistake in the calculations.Wait, let's step back. For n=3, r=2.Total subsets: C(3,2)=3. The capacities are 2-1=1, 3-1=2, 3-2=1. Sum is 1+2+1=4. Average is 4/3 ≈1.333...But according to the formula I derived, 2(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1) = 2(1)(4)/3 = 8/3 ≈2.666, which is not equal. So, my formula is wrong.Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.Let me check again.Starting from S = (r -1) * [ n * Σ C(m, r -1) - Σ m * C(m, r -1) ]We found Σ C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1 is C(n, r). Correct.Then Σ m * C(m, r -1) was found to be (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r)Wait, but when n=3, r=2:Σ m * C(m,1) from m=1 to 2 (since r=2, m from 1 to 2)For m=1: 1*C(1,1)=1*1=1For m=2: 2*C(2,1)=2*2=4Total sum:1+4=5According to the formula: (r -1) * C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r) =1*C(4,3)-C(3,2)=4 -3=1But actual sum is 5, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the formula is incorrect. So, my mistake was in the combinatorial identities.So, going back to Σ m * C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1.In our example, n=3, r=2. So, m goes from 1 to 2.Σ m*C(m,1)=1*1 +2*2=1+4=5But according to the formula I had:(r -1)*C(n +1, r +1) - C(n, r)=1*C(4,3) - C(3,2)=4 -3=1≠5Thus, my previous approach is flawed. So, need to find another way.Alternative approach: Let's directly compute Σ (n - d) * C(d, r -1) for d from r-1 to n-1.Wait, in the example with n=3, r=2:The original sum S was supposed to be Σ [ (n - d) * d * C(d -1, r -2) ] for d from r-1 to n-1.But when r=2, r -2=0, so C(d -1,0)=1 for any d≥1.Therefore, S= Σ [ (3 - d) * d * 1 ] for d=1 to 2.So, d=1: (3 -1)*1*1=2*1=2d=2: (3 -2)*2*1=1*2=2Total S=2+2=4Then F(n, r)= S / C(n, r)=4 /3 ≈1.333..., which matches the actual average.But according to my general formula, it gave 8/3. So, problem is in the general formula.Wait, so in this example, S=4=2(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1)*C(n, r)Plugging in r=2, n=3: 2*1*4/3 *3= 8/3*3=8, but actual S=4. So, formula is wrong.Therefore, my mistake must have occurred in the algebraic manipulation. Let me re-examine the steps.Original expression:S = (r -1) * [ n * C(n, r) - Σ m * C(m, r -1) ]But Σ m * C(m, r -1) from m=r-1 to n-1. In our example, Σ m*C(m,1)=5. So,S=(2 -1)*[3*C(3,2)-5]=1*(3*3 -5)=9 -5=4. Which is correct. Then, F(n, r)=4 / C(3,2)=4/3, which is correct.Therefore, when I tried to express Σ m*C(m, r -1) in terms of combinatorial coefficients, I made a mistake. Hence, the formula for the sum S is:S = (r -1) * [n * C(n, r) - Σ m*C(m, r -1) ]But Σ m*C(m, r -1) is not expressible via the identity I used. Therefore, perhaps a different approach is needed.Alternative idea: Instead of trying to compute the sum over all d, maybe use linearity of expectation. Think of the average capacity as the expectation of (max - min) over all r-element subsets.So, F(n, r)= E[max - min] = E[max] - E[min]Therefore, if we can compute E[max] and E[min], then subtract them.This might be a simpler approach. Let's try that.Yes, this seems promising. Because expectation is linear, so E[max - min] = E[max] - E[min].Therefore, compute E[max] and E[min] for a random r-element subset of {1, 2, ..., n}, then subtract.So, let's compute E[max].The probability that the maximum element is k is equal to the number of subsets of size r with max k divided by C(n, r). The number of subsets with max k is C(k -1, r -1), since we need to choose the remaining r -1 elements from {1, 2, ..., k -1}.Therefore, E[max] = Σ (k= r to n) [ k * C(k -1, r -1) ] / C(n, r)Similarly, E[min] = Σ (k=1 to n - r +1) [k * C(n - k, r -1) ] / C(n, r)Wait, for E[min], the minimum element k must be such that there are r -1 elements larger than k, so the number of subsets with min k is C(n - k, r -1). Wait, no. Wait, if the minimum is k, then the other r -1 elements must be from {k +1, ..., n}, which has size n - k. Therefore, the number of subsets with min k is C(n - k, r -1). But k can be at most n - (r -1) = n - r +1. So, yes, E[min] = Σ (k=1 to n - r +1) [k * C(n - k, r -1) ] / C(n, r)Therefore, E[max] - E[min] = [ Σ (k=r to n) k * C(k -1, r -1) - Σ (k=1 to n - r +1) k * C(n - k, r -1) ] / C(n, r)But this might be complex to compute. However, perhaps there are known formulae for E[max] and E[min].I recall that for uniform random selection without replacement, the expectation of the maximum in a sample of size r from {1, 2, ..., n} is r(n +1)/(r +1). Wait, is that correct? Let me check with the example where n=3, r=2.E[max] = [2*C(1,1) +3*C(2,1)] / C(3,2)= [2*1 +3*2]/3= (2 +6)/3=8/3≈2.666...Similarly, if the formula is r(n +1)/(r +1)=2*4/3=8/3, which matches.Similarly, E[min] = [1*C(2,1) +2*C(1,1)] / C(3,2)= [1*2 +2*1]/3=(2 +2)/3=4/3≈1.333...Then, E[max] - E[min] =8/3 -4/3=4/3, which is correct.So, seems like E[max] = r(n +1)/(r +1) and E[min] = (n +1) - r(n +1)/(r +1) = (n +1)(1 - r/(r +1)) = (n +1)/(r +1). Wait, but in our example, E[min]=4/3=(3 +1)/(2 +1)=4/3. Which matches.Wait, so is there a general formula for E[min]?Wait, for E[min], if we consider the symmetry, if we reverse the order of the elements. For example, the minimum of a subset of size r from {1, 2, ..., n} is analogous to the maximum of a subset of size r from {n, n-1, ..., 1}. Therefore, E[min] = (n +1) - E[max], but where E[max] is computed for the reversed set, which is same as the original.Wait, but not sure. Wait, in our example, E[min]=4/3, which is (n +1)/(r +1)=4/3. Similarly, E[max]= r(n +1)/(r +1)=2*4/3=8/3. Therefore, E[min]=(n +1)/(r +1). So, perhaps in general, E[max] = r(n +1)/(r +1) and E[min]=(n +1)/(r +1). Therefore, F(n, r)= E[max] - E[min] = [r(n +1) - (n +1)]/(r +1) = (r -1)(n +1)/(r +1). Therefore, F(n, r)=(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1). For the example, (2 -1)(3 +1)/(2 +1)=1*4/3=4/3, which is correct.Wait, so that seems to be the case. Then, is this general formula correct?Yes, if E[max] = r(n +1)/(r +1) and E[min]=(n +1)/(r +1), then their difference is (r -1)(n +1)/(r +1). Let's verify for another example.Take n=4, r=2.Subsets of size 2: {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}. Capacities:1,2,3,1,2,1. Sum=1+2+3+1+2+1=10. Average=10/6≈1.666...Formula: (2 -1)(4 +1)/(2 +1)=1*5/3≈1.666..., which matches.Another example: n=4, r=3.Subsets of size 3: {1,2,3}, capacity 2; {1,2,4}, capacity3; {1,3,4}, capacity3; {2,3,4}, capacity2. Sum=2+3+3+2=10. Average=10/4=2.5.Formula: (3 -1)(4 +1)/(3 +1)=2*5/4=10/4=2.5. Correct.Therefore, the formula F(n, r)=(r -1)(n +1)/(r +1) is correct.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{(r - 1)(n + 1)}{r + 1}}.Final AnswerThe arithmetic mean of the capacities is boxed{dfrac{(r - 1)(n + 1)}{r + 1}}.</think>To find the arithmetic mean of the capacities of all ( r )-element subsets of the set ( M = {1, 2, ldots, n} ), we need to compute the expectation of the capacity, which is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of a subset. The key steps involve recognizing that the capacity of a subset is the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. By linearity of expectation, the expected capacity is the difference between the expected maximum and the expected minimum of a random ( r )-element subset.1. Expected Maximum (E[max]):   - The expected value of the maximum element in a random ( r )-element subset of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) is given by:     [     E[text{max}] = frac{r(n + 1)}{r + 1}     ]2. Expected Minimum (E[min]):   - The expected value of the minimum element in a random ( r )-element subset of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) is given by:     [     E[text{min}] = frac{(n + 1)}{r + 1}     ]3. Expected Capacity:   - The arithmetic mean of the capacities, ( F(n, r) ), is the difference between the expected maximum and the expected minimum:     [     F(n, r) = E[text{max}] - E[text{min}] = frac{r(n + 1)}{r + 1} - frac{(n + 1)}{r + 1} = frac{(r - 1)(n + 1)}{r + 1}     ]Thus, the arithmetic mean of the capacities of all ( r )-element subsets of the set ( M ) is given by:[boxed{dfrac{(r - 1)(n + 1)}{r + 1}}]]"},{"problem":"30. [20] How many positive integers k are there such thatfrac{k}{2013}(a+b)=l c m(a, b)has a solution in positive integers (a, b) ?","solution":"Answer: 1006 First, we can let h=operatorname{gcd}(a, b) so that (a, b)=(h A, h B) where operatorname{gcd}(A, B)=1. Making these subtitutions yields frac{k}{2013}(h A+h B)=h A B, so k=frac{2013 A B}{A+B}. Because A and B are relatively prime, A+B shares no common factors with neither A nor B, so in order to have k be an integer, A+B must divide 2013, and since A and B are positive, A+B>1.We first show that for different possible values of A+B, the values of k generated are distinct. In particular, we need to show that frac{2013 A B}{A+B} neq frac{2013 A^{prime} B^{prime}}{A^{prime}+B^{prime}} whenever A+B neq A^{prime}+B^{prime}. Assume that such an equality exists, and cross-multiplying yields A Bleft(A^{prime}+B^{prime}right)=A^{prime} B^{prime}(A+B). Since A B is relatively prime to A+B, we must have A+B divide A^{prime}+B^{prime}. With a similar argument, we can show that A^{prime}+B^{prime} must divide A+B, so A+B=A^{prime}+B^{prime}.Now, we need to show that for the same denominator A+B, the values of k generated are also distinct for some relatively prime non-ordered pair (A, B). Let n=A+B=C+D. Assume that frac{2013 A B}{n}=frac{2013 C D}{n}, or equivalently, A(n-A)=C(n-C). After some rearrangement, we have (C+A)(C-A)={ }_{n}^{n}(C-A) This implies that either C=A or C=n-A=B. But in either case, (C, D) is some permutation of (A, B).Our answer can therefore be obtained by summing up the totients of the factors of 2013 (excluding 1) and dividing by 2 since (A, B) and (B, A) correspond to the same k value, so our answer is frac{2013-1}{2}= 1006 .Remark: It can be proven that the sum of the totients of all the factors of any positive integer N equals N, but in this case, the sum of the totients can be computed by hand.","generations":"[<think>Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the number of positive integers k such that the equation (k/2013)(a + b) = lcm(a, b) has a solution in positive integers (a, b). Hmm. Alright, let's try to break this down step by step.First, I know that the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers a and b is related to their greatest common divisor (gcd). The formula is lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b). Maybe this relationship will be useful here. Let me write that down:lcm(a, b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b)So the equation given is:(k/2013)(a + b) = (a*b)/gcd(a, b)Let me rearrange this equation to make it clearer. Multiply both sides by 2013 to eliminate the denominator:k(a + b) = 2013*(a*b)/gcd(a, b)Hmm. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then we can write a = d*m and b = d*n, where m and n are coprime positive integers (since we've factored out the gcd). So substituting these into the equation:k(d*m + d*n) = 2013*(d*m*d*n)/dSimplify both sides. On the left side: k*d*(m + n). On the right side: 2013*(d^2*m*n)/d = 2013*d*m*n. So:k*d*(m + n) = 2013*d*m*nWe can cancel out the d from both sides (since d is a positive integer, it's non-zero):k*(m + n) = 2013*m*nSo now, we have:k = (2013*m*n)/(m + n)And since m and n are coprime, we need this expression to be an integer. So, k must be equal to (2013*m*n)/(m + n), and m and n are coprime positive integers. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all positive integers k such that there exist coprime m and n where k is equal to 2013*m*n divided by (m + n).So, the question now becomes: For how many positive integers k does there exist coprime positive integers m and n such that k = 2013*m*n/(m + n)?Alternatively, k must be a divisor of 2013*m*n/(m + n) for some coprime m and n. Hmm. Alternatively, (m + n) must divide 2013*m*n. Since m and n are coprime, their gcd is 1, so m + n divides 2013*m*n. But since m and n are coprime, m + n must divide 2013. Wait, is that right?Wait, let's think. Since m and n are coprime, then m and n share no common factors. Therefore, m + n and m might share a common factor? Let's see. Suppose d divides m + n and m. Then d divides (m + n) - m = n. But since gcd(m, n) = 1, then d must be 1. Similarly, m + n and n are coprime. Therefore, m + n and m are coprime, and m + n and n are coprime. Therefore, m + n is coprime to both m and n. Therefore, m + n divides 2013. Because m + n divides 2013*m*n, and since m + n is coprime to m and n, it must divide 2013. Therefore, m + n is a divisor of 2013. Therefore, m + n must be a positive divisor of 2013.Therefore, the possible values of s = m + n are the positive divisors of 2013. Let's first factorize 2013 to find its divisors. Let's do that.2013 divided by 3 is 671. Then 671 divided by 11 is 61. 61 is a prime number. So, 2013 factors into 3 * 11 * 61. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8. So the positive divisors are:1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013.But s = m + n must be at least 2, since m and n are positive integers (so the smallest they can be is 1 each, but m and n must be coprime. If m = 1 and n = 1, then m + n = 2, but 2 is not a divisor of 2013. Wait, 2013 is odd, so all its divisors are odd. Therefore, s must be an odd divisor of 2013. But the divisors we have listed above are 1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013. All of these are odd. So m + n can be any of these divisors. However, m and n must be positive integers such that m + n = s, and gcd(m, n) = 1. So for each divisor s of 2013, we need to find pairs (m, n) where m + n = s and gcd(m, n) = 1.But since m and n are positive integers, m ranges from 1 to s - 1, and n = s - m. Then gcd(m, s - m) = gcd(m, s). Since m and s - m are the two numbers. Since s is a divisor of 2013, which is 3*11*61, so s is some combination of these primes.For each s, the number of pairs (m, n) with m + n = s and gcd(m, n) = 1 is equal to the number of integers m between 1 and s - 1 such that gcd(m, s) = 1. Because gcd(m, n) = gcd(m, s - m) = gcd(m, s). So since m and s - m must be coprime, it's equivalent to gcd(m, s) = 1. Therefore, the number of such m is φ(s), Euler's totient function. But since m and n are ordered pairs (since (m, n) and (n, m) are different unless m = n), but wait in our case, since a and b are just positive integers, so (a, b) and (b, a) would be considered the same solution or different? Wait, the problem says \\"a solution in positive integers (a, b)\\". So ordered pairs? Hmm. Wait, but in our substitution, a = d*m and b = d*n. So m and n are part of the coprime pair. So when we write m and n, they are ordered pairs? Or is it unordered? Because if m and n are swapped, a and b would be swapped. But since the problem counts (a, b) as a solution, which is ordered, then m and n are also ordered. Therefore, for each s, the number of ordered pairs (m, n) with m + n = s and gcd(m, n) = 1 is φ(s). Wait, no. Wait, actually, if m ranges from 1 to s - 1, and for each m, n = s - m. So the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of m in 1 to s -1 with gcd(m, s) = 1. But since for each m, we have a unique n, so the number of ordered pairs is φ(s). However, if we consider unordered pairs, it would be φ(s)/2. But since in our problem, (a, b) is ordered, so we need to count ordered pairs. Therefore, for each s, the number of ordered pairs is φ(s). But actually, wait, φ(s) counts the numbers m from 1 to s coprime to s. So m and s - m are two different numbers unless s is even. But s is a divisor of 2013, which is odd, so s is odd. Therefore, s is odd, so m and s - m are distinct. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs is φ(s). But since m and n are co-prime, but we already have that m and n are co-prime if and only if gcd(m, s) = 1. So yes, for each s, the number of ordered pairs (m, n) with m + n = s and gcd(m, n) = 1 is φ(s). But perhaps we need to check that. For example, take s = 3. Then possible pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1). Both have gcd 1. φ(3) = 2, which matches. For s = 11, φ(11) = 10, which would mean 10 ordered pairs. Each m from 1 to 10, n = 11 - m. But since 11 is prime, all m from 1 to 10 are coprime to 11, so indeed 10 ordered pairs.But in our problem, we need to find the number of distinct k's. So each pair (m, n) gives a k = 2013*m*n/(m + n) = 2013*m*n/s. Since s is a divisor of 2013, let's write s as a divisor of 2013. Then k = 2013/s * m*n. Since s divides 2013, 2013/s is an integer. So k must be equal to (2013/s)*m*n. But m and n are positive integers with m + n = s and gcd(m, n) = 1. Also, since m and n are coprime, and m + n = s, which is a divisor of 2013, then m and n must be coprime to s as well? Wait, earlier we had that gcd(m, s) = 1. Because gcd(m, s) = gcd(m, m + n) = gcd(m, n) = 1. So m and s are coprime, similarly n and s are coprime. Therefore, both m and n are coprime to s. Therefore, since s divides 2013, and m and n are coprime to s, then m and n are coprime to 2013 as well? Because s is a divisor of 2013, so any common divisor of m and 2013 would also divide s, but m is coprime to s, hence m is coprime to 2013. Similarly for n. Therefore, m and n are coprime to 2013.Therefore, k = (2013/s) * m * n. Since 2013/s is an integer, and m and n are coprime to 2013, but not necessarily coprime to each other? Wait, no, m and n are coprime to each other because gcd(m, n) = 1. Wait, but m and n are coprime, and both coprime to s. So in k = (2013/s)*m*n, m and n are coprime, and each coprime to s, which is a divisor of 2013. Therefore, m and n are coprime to 2013/s as well? Not necessarily. Wait, 2013/s is an integer. Let's denote t = 2013/s. Then k = t*m*n. Since s is a divisor of 2013, t is an integer.But m and n are coprime to s. Since t = 2013/s, which is equal to (3*11*61)/s. So t will have prime factors among 3, 11, 61, depending on s. For example, if s = 3, then t = 2013/3 = 11*61. If s = 11, t = 3*61. If s = 61, t = 3*11. If s = 33 (3*11), then t = 61, etc.So m and n are coprime to s, which is a divisor of 2013. Therefore, m and n are coprime to 3, 11, 61 if those primes are in s. Wait, no. If s is a divisor, then m and n are coprime to s. So for example, if s = 3, then m and n must be coprime to 3, but they could have factors 11 or 61? Wait, no. Because m and n are coprime to s = 3. So m and n can have factors 11 or 61, but not 3. Similarly, if s = 11, m and n can have factors 3 or 61, but not 11. Hmm. Wait, but m and n are coprime. So if m and n are coprime, and each is coprime to s, then m and n can only have prime factors outside of s's prime factors. But since 2013 is 3*11*61, and s is a divisor, so s is made up of some combination of 3, 11, 61. Then m and n must be coprime to s, so they can't have 3, 11, or 61 as factors, depending on s. Wait, no. If s is 3, then m and n must be coprime to 3, so they can't have 3 as a factor. But they can have 11 or 61, but since m and n are coprime, they can't both have 11 or 61. Wait, but 11 and 61 are primes. So if m is divisible by 11, then n can't be, since m and n are coprime. Similarly for 61. Wait, but if s is 3, then m + n = 3, and m and n are coprime to 3. So possible m and n are (1, 2) or (2, 1). Both 1 and 2 are coprime to 3, and coprime to each other. So in this case, m and n are 1 and 2. Then k = (2013/3)*(1*2) = 671*2 = 1342. Wait, so k = 1342 in this case.But 1 and 2 are coprime and coprime to 3. So m and n can have factors outside of s's prime factors. So m and n can have prime factors not in 3,11,61? Wait, but m and n are positive integers. They can have any prime factors, as long as they don't have the primes in s. Wait, but s is a divisor of 2013, so s can be 1,3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. If s = 1, then m + n =1, but m and n are positive integers, so impossible. So s starts from 3. Wait, but s =1 is a divisor, but m and n can't be positive integers. So the possible s are the divisors of 2013 starting from 3. But 3 is the smallest divisor greater than 1.But in our case, since m and n are positive integers, m + n must be at least 2, but since all divisors of 2013 are odd (as 2013 is odd), the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 3, which would correspond to m=1, n=2. But 1+2=3.Wait, let's get back. So for each divisor s of 2013 (excluding 1, since m and n must be positive integers and their sum s must be at least 2, but since 2013 is odd, all its divisors except 1 are odd and >=3). So s can be 3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. So 7 divisors. Wait, earlier we had 8 divisors: 1,3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. So excluding 1, we have 7 divisors. So for each of these 7 values of s, we can compute k as (2013/s)*m*n, where m and n are coprime positive integers with m + n = s. But m and n are coprime and m + n = s. So for each s, the possible pairs (m, n) are those where m is from 1 to s-1, coprime to s, and n = s - m. Then m and n are coprime. So the product m*n for each such pair will vary, and hence k will be (2013/s)*m*n. But we need to find all such possible k's. However, different pairs (m, n) for the same s might lead to the same k. So the question is, how many distinct k's can be formed in this way?Alternatively, since for each s, we can get multiple k's, and we need to count the union over all s of these k's. However, it's possible that different s could lead to the same k, so we need to ensure we don't double-count. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.Wait, maybe instead of considering each s separately, we can analyze the structure of k. Remember that k must be equal to (2013/s)*m*n, where m + n = s, gcd(m, n) = 1, and s is a divisor of 2013. Let's denote t = 2013/s, so k = t*m*n. Since s is a divisor of 2013, t is an integer. Also, m + n = s, and gcd(m, n) = 1. Also, since m and n are coprime, they are each coprime to s (as established earlier). Therefore, m and n are coprime to t as well? Wait, t = 2013/s. Since s is a divisor of 2013, t is also a divisor of 2013. For example, if s = 3, t = 2013/3 = 11*61. So t is 671. Then m and n are coprime to s=3, so they can have factors that are in t, which is 11 and 61? Wait, but m and n are coprime to s=3, so they can have factors 11 or 61. But m and n are coprime to each other. So if m is divisible by 11, then n can't be divisible by 11. Similarly, if m is divisible by 61, n can't be. But since m + n = s=3, m and n must be 1 and 2. But 1 and 2 are not divisible by 11 or 61, so in this case, m and n are 1 and 2. Then k = t*m*n = 671*1*2 = 1342.Wait, so in this case, m and n can't actually have factors of 11 or 61 because they add up to 3. So m and n are 1 and 2. Therefore, even though t has factors 11 and 61, m and n can't. Therefore, in general, for each s, m and n are positive integers adding to s, coprime, so they can't have any prime factors that are in s. Since s is a divisor of 2013, which is 3*11*61, so s can be 3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. Therefore, m and n must be coprime to s. For example, if s=3, m and n must be coprime to 3. But m + n =3, so possible m=1, n=2. Which are coprime to 3. Similarly, if s=11, m +n=11, and m and n must be coprime to 11, so m can range from 1 to 10, coprime to 11. But 11 is prime, so m can be 1,2,...,10. Then n=11 - m. So pairs (1,10),(2,9),...,(10,1). Each pair has gcd(m, n)=1, since m and 11 are coprime. For example, m=2, n=9: gcd(2,9)=1. Similarly, m=3, n=8: gcd(3,8)=1. So yes, all these pairs are coprime.Then k = t*m*n, where t=2013/s. For s=11, t=2013/11=183. So k=183*m*n. For each pair (m, n), m and n are coprime, and m + n=11. So m ranges from 1 to 10, coprime to 11. So m=1,2,...,10. Therefore, m*n can be 1*10=10, 2*9=18, 3*8=24, 4*7=28, 5*6=30, 6*5=30, 7*4=28, 8*3=24, 9*2=18, 10*1=10. So the products m*n are 10,18,24,28,30. But since (m,n) are ordered pairs, but m*n is the same for (m,n) and (n,m). However, since k=183*m*n, then k would be 183*10, 183*18, 183*24, 183*28, 183*30. So for s=11, the possible k's are 183*10, 183*18, 183*24, 183*28, 183*30. These are distinct? Let's check:183*10=1830,183*18=3294,183*24=4392,183*28=5124,183*30=5490.Yes, distinct. Therefore, for s=11, there are 5 distinct k's. But wait, since (m,n) and (n,m) give the same product m*n, so each product is counted twice except when m=n. But since s=11 is odd, m ≠ n. So all products are distinct when considering ordered pairs? Wait, no. For example, m=1 and n=10 gives product 10, and m=10 and n=1 gives product 10 as well. But in the equation k=183*m*n, since m and n are part of ordered pairs, but the product m*n is the same regardless. However, since (a,b) is ordered, then (m,n) is ordered, so (1,10) and (10,1) are different pairs but lead to the same k. Therefore, we need to consider whether different ordered pairs (m,n) can lead to the same k.Wait, in the case of s=11, the pairs (1,10) and (10,1) give the same product m*n=10, so same k=183*10. Similarly, (2,9) and (9,2) give m*n=18, so same k=183*18, etc. Therefore, even though there are φ(s)=10 ordered pairs, the number of distinct k's is φ(s)/2, since each pair and its reverse give the same product. But φ(s) is even for s > 2. Since s is odd (divisor of 2013), φ(s) is even for s > 2, as φ(s) for s being prime is s-1, which is even if s is odd prime. For composite s, φ(s) is also even. Therefore, for each s, the number of distinct k's would be φ(s)/2.But wait, in the case of s=3, φ(s)=2. So φ(s)/2=1. Indeed, there's only one distinct k: 1342. Similarly, for s=11, φ(11)=10, so φ(s)/2=5. Which matches the example above. For s=33, which is 3*11, φ(33)=φ(3)*φ(11)=2*10=20, so φ(s)/2=10. So for each s, the number of distinct k's is φ(s)/2. Therefore, the total number of distinct k's is the sum over all s | 2013, s > 1, of φ(s)/2.But wait, we need to confirm this. Let's take s=3, φ(3)=2, so 1 k. s=11, φ(11)=10, 5 k's. s=61, φ(61)=60, so 30 k's. s=33 (3*11), φ(33)=20, so 10 k's. s=183 (3*61), φ(183)=φ(3*61)=φ(3)*φ(61)=2*60=120, so 60 k's. s=671 (11*61), φ(671)=φ(11)*φ(61)=10*60=600, so 300 k's. s=2013 (3*11*61), φ(2013)=φ(3)*φ(11)*φ(61)=2*10*60=1200, so 600 k's.Therefore, the total number of k's would be 1 + 5 + 30 + 10 + 60 + 300 + 600. Wait, but hold on: s=3,11,61,33,183,671,2013. So sum:s=3: 1s=11:5s=61:30s=33:10s=183:60s=671:300s=2013:600Total: 1 +5=6; 6+30=36; 36+10=46; 46+60=106; 106+300=406; 406+600=1006.But wait, 1+5+30+10+60+300+600 = 1006. But this seems like a lot. But 2013 is a big number, so maybe. However, we need to check if these k's are distinct across different s. Because maybe a k from s=3 could be the same as a k from s=11, etc. So the total number might not be the simple sum. Therefore, this approach might overcount. So maybe this approach is flawed.Alternatively, perhaps each k corresponds uniquely to a pair (s, m*n), but since m and n are coprime and m + n = s, which is a divisor of 2013, and s is fixed, maybe the k's are unique. Wait, but how can we be sure? For example, suppose for s=3, k=1342. For s=11, could there be a k=1342? Let's see. For s=11, t=183. So k=183*m*n. Is 1342 divisible by 183? Let's check: 183*7=1281, 183*7=1281, 183*8=1464. 1342 is between 1281 and 1464, so not divisible by 183. So k=1342 is unique to s=3. Similarly, check for another k. For example, take s=11 and k=183*10=1830. Is there another s where 1830 can be achieved? For s=3, k=1342. For s=61, t=2013/61=33. So k=33*m*n. 33*m*n=1830 => m*n=1830/33≈55.45. Not integer. So no. For s=33, t=2013/33=61. So k=61*m*n. 61*m*n=1830 => m*n=30. Possible? If s=33, m + n=33, and m*n=30. So solving m + n=33, m*n=30. This would require solving quadratic equation x^2 -33x +30=0. The discriminant is 33^2 - 120=1089 -120=969, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, no solution. Therefore, k=1830 is unique to s=11. So maybe k's from different s are distinct. Similarly, k's from same s are distinct. Therefore, total number of k's is the sum over s of φ(s)/2.But 1006 seems like a lot. However, 2013 is 3*11*61, so it's possible that the number is high. But maybe there is a different approach.Wait, let's think differently. The equation is k/(2013) * (a + b) = lcm(a, b). Let me write this as k * (a + b) = 2013 * lcm(a, b). Let me denote d = gcd(a, b), so that a = d*m, b = d*n, with gcd(m, n)=1. Then lcm(a, b) = d*m*n. So substituting into the equation:k*(d*m + d*n) = 2013*d*m*nCancel d:k*(m + n) = 2013*m*nTherefore, k = (2013*m*n)/(m + n)So, k must be equal to (2013*m*n)/(m + n), where m and n are coprime positive integers. So the problem reduces to finding the number of positive integers k such that k can be written in this form for some coprime m, n.Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct integers of the form (2013*m*n)/(m + n), where m and n are coprime positive integers.Now, note that m and n are coprime, so (m + n) and m are coprime, and (m + n) and n are coprime. Therefore, m + n divides 2013. Wait, how?Because k = (2013*m*n)/(m + n) must be an integer. Since m and n are coprime, m and n are coprime to m + n as well. Therefore, m + n must divide 2013. Because m and n are coprime to m + n, so m + n divides 2013. Therefore, s = m + n is a positive divisor of 2013, and m and n are coprime positive integers with m + n = s. So, for each divisor s of 2013 (excluding 1), the number of pairs (m, n) is φ(s), as before, but each pair gives a k = (2013/s)*m*n. But since m and n are coprime and m + n = s, which is a divisor of 2013, m and n must be coprime to s. Therefore, m and n are coprime to 2013/s as well? Wait, not necessarily. Because m and n are coprime to s, but 2013/s is another factor. Wait, 2013/s and s are co-prime? Since 2013 is square-free (it's 3*11*61), so all its divisors are square-free. So s and 2013/s are coprime. Because if s is a divisor, then 2013 = s * t where t is coprime to s. For example, s=3, t=2013/3=11*61=671, which is coprime to 3. Similarly, s=11, t=3*61=183, coprime to 11. Therefore, s and t=2013/s are coprime. Therefore, m and n are coprime to s, and since t is coprime to s, m and n can be any integers coprime to s. But since m and n are coprime to s and s and t are coprime, m and n can have factors in t. However, m and n are coprime to each other. Therefore, m and n are coprime to s and coprime to each other. Therefore, the product m*n is coprime to s, but since t=2013/s is coprime to s, then t*m*n is an integer, and since m and n are coprime to s, which is coprime to t, then k = t*m*n must be in the form where k is a multiple of t and m*n. Since m and n can vary over coprime pairs summing to s, which is fixed.But how does this help? Maybe not.Alternatively, since s is a divisor of 2013, and t=2013/s, which is coprime to s, then m and n are coprime to s. Therefore, m and n are coprime to both s and t. Therefore, m and n are coprime to 2013. Because 2013 = s*t, and s and t are coprime. So since m and n are coprime to s and to t, they are coprime to 2013. Therefore, m and n must be coprime to 3, 11, and 61. Therefore, m and n can only be 1 or numbers composed of primes other than 3, 11, 61. However, m + n = s, which is a divisor of 2013 (i.e., 3,11,33,61, etc.). Therefore, since s is a divisor of 2013, which is 3*11*61, and m and n are positive integers adding up to s, and coprime to s, but since s is made up of 3,11,61, m and n must be 1 and s-1, since any other numbers would have common factors with s. Wait, no. For example, take s=33=3*11. Then m and n must be coprime to 33. So m and n can be 1 and 32, 2 and 31, 4 and 29, etc., as long as they are coprime to 33. However, m and n must add up to 33 and be coprime to 33. So pairs like (1,32), (2,31), (4,29), (5,28), (7,26), (8,25), (10,23), (13,20), (14,19), (16,17). Each of these pairs has m and n coprime to 33, and coprime to each other. Then for each of these pairs, k = t*m*n where t=2013/s=61. Therefore, k=61*m*n. Each of these m*n is unique? For example, 1*32=32, 2*31=62, 4*29=116, 5*28=140, etc. So each product is unique, leading to unique k's. Hence, for each s, the number of distinct k's is equal to the number of coprime pairs (m, n) with m + n = s, which is φ(s), but since each pair (m, n) and (n, m) gives the same product m*n, the number of distinct k's per s is φ(s)/2. But φ(s) is even for s > 2, so it's an integer. For example, s=3: φ(3)=2, so 1 k. s=11: φ(11)=10, so 5 k's. Similarly, s=33: φ(33)=20, so 10 k's. So the total number of k's is the sum over all s | 2013, s >1, of φ(s)/2.Given that 2013 has divisors 1,3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. Excluding 1, we have 7 divisors. Calculating φ(s) for each:s=3: φ(3)=2, so 1 k.s=11: φ(11)=10, so 5 k's.s=33: φ(3*11)=φ(3)*φ(11)=2*10=20, so 10 k's.s=61: φ(61)=60, so 30 k's.s=183: φ(3*61)=φ(3)*φ(61)=2*60=120, so 60 k's.s=671: φ(11*61)=φ(11)*φ(61)=10*60=600, so 300 k's.s=2013: φ(3*11*61)=φ(3)*φ(11)*φ(61)=2*10*60=1200, so 600 k's.Adding these up: 1 + 5 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 300 + 600 = 1006.But the problem states that k is a positive integer, and asks how many such k exist. However, 1006 seems quite large. Let me check if there's a mistake.Wait, but if we think of m and n as positive integers coprime to each other and to s, then for each s, the products m*n would indeed generate unique k's because m and n are coprime to s and to each other, and s and t=2013/s are coprime. Therefore, k = t*m*n, and since m and n are coprime to t and to each other, each combination would lead to a unique k. Wait, but m and n are not necessarily coprime to t. Wait, t=2013/s. Since s and t are coprime, and m and n are coprime to s, but m and n can have factors in t. For example, s=3, t=11*61. m and n are 1 and 2, which are coprime to 3 but not necessarily to 11 or 61. However, in that case, m=1 and n=2 are both coprime to 11 and 61 as well. So in general, m and n are coprime to s, and since s and t are coprime, m and n can only have factors in t. However, if m and n are coprime to each other, and m and n are each coprime to s, then their product m*n is coprime to s, but not necessarily to t. Wait, but t is a factor of 2013, which is 3*11*61. So t could be divisible by primes 3,11,61. However, since s and t are coprime, t doesn't have the prime factors of s. For example, if s=3, then t=11*61, so m and n are coprime to 3, but can have factors 11 or 61. But m and n are coprime to each other. Therefore, if m is divisible by 11, then n cannot be divisible by 11, and similarly for 61. But m + n = s=3, so m and n have to be 1 and 2, which aren't divisible by 11 or 61. Therefore, m*n=2, which is coprime to t=11*61. Therefore, k=11*61*2=1342, which is 2*11*61.Similarly, for s=11, t=3*61=183. m and n are coprime to 11, so they can't be multiples of 11. Since m + n=11, possible m=1,2,...,10. None of these are multiples of 11, so m and n are 1,10;2,9; etc. Their products are 10,18,24,28,30. Each of these is coprime to 11 but may have factors 3 or 61. For example, m=2, n=9: 2 and 9. 9 is divisible by 3, which is in t=3*61. So m*n=18=2*3^2. Then k=183*18= (3*61)*(2*3^2)= 2*3^3*61. Similarly, m=3, n=8: m=3 (which is in t), n=8. m*n=24=3*8. So k=183*24=3*61*24=24*3*61. So these k's have factors in t. However, since m and n are coprime, each prime factor in m*n can only come from m or n, but not both. But m and n can have prime factors in t. So the k's would be multiples of t times m*n, where m and n are coprime and sum to s. Therefore, these k's are distinct across different s.For example, k=1342 for s=3 is 2*11*61. For s=11, k=183*10=2*3*5*61. These are different factorizations, so distinct k's. Similarly, other k's would have unique factorizations. Therefore, the total number of k's is indeed the sum over s of φ(s)/2, which totals 1006.But the problem is from an Olympiad, and 1006 seems too large for an answer. Likely, there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me reconsider.Wait, perhaps the key insight is that k must be of the form 2013*m*n/(m + n) where m and n are coprime. Let's consider that 2013 = 3*11*61. Then, for m and n coprime, let's set m = x, n = y, so k = 2013xy/(x + y). Let's denote d = gcd(x + y, 2013). Then, since x and y are coprime, x + y and x are coprime (since any common divisor would divide y, but x and y are coprime), similarly x + y and y are coprime. Therefore, x + y divides 2013. Therefore, x + y must be a divisor of 2013. Therefore, s = x + y is a divisor of 2013. Therefore, k = 2013/s * x*y. Since x and y are coprime to s, and x*y is coprime to s (because x and y are each coprime to s), then 2013/s and x*y must be such that k is an integer. Since s divides 2013, 2013/s is an integer, so k is an integer. Therefore, the number of such k is equal to the number of distinct products (2013/s)*x*y where s divides 2013 and x, y are coprime positive integers with x + y = s.Now, since x and y are coprime and x + y = s, which is a divisor of 2013, then x and y are coprime to s. Therefore, x and y are each less than s and coprime to s. Therefore, for each s, the number of pairs (x, y) is φ(s). However, since (x, y) and (y, x) give the same product x*y, the number of distinct products x*y is φ(s)/2. Therefore, the number of distinct k's is the sum over all s | 2013, s >= 2, of φ(s)/2.But 2013 has 8 divisors, excluding 1, we have 7 divisors. For each divisor s, we compute φ(s)/2 and sum:s=3: φ(3)/2=2/2=1s=11:φ(11)/2=10/2=5s=33:φ(33)/2=20/2=10s=61:φ(61)/2=60/2=30s=183:φ(183)/2=120/2=60s=671:φ(671)/2=600/2=300s=2013:φ(2013)/2=1200/2=600Summing these: 1+5=6, 6+10=16, 16+30=46, 46+60=106, 106+300=406, 406+600=1006.So, according to this reasoning, the answer is 1006. But is this possible? Let's check with smaller numbers. Suppose instead of 2013, we have a smaller number, say 6. Let's see what the answer would be.For example, suppose the problem was with 6 instead of 2013. So find the number of k such that (k/6)(a + b) = lcm(a, b) has a solution. Following the same steps:k = 6*m*n/(m + n). The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. Excluding 1, s=2,3,6.For s=2: φ(2)/2=1/2. Wait, but φ(2)=1. So 1/2 is not an integer. But s=2 is even. Wait, in our original problem, 2013 is odd, so all s are odd. In this example, 6 is even. So the previous reasoning may not apply. Let's try with s=3.But this is getting complicated. Let's instead see if the answer 1006 is correct. But given the problem is [20], which might indicate the answer is 2013's number of divisors multiplied by something, but 2013 has 8 divisors. However, 8 divisors, and the answer is 1006. Hmm. But perhaps the answer is 1006. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that all k's are distinct.Wait, think of s=3 and s=2013. For s=3, k=2013/3 *1*2=671*2=1342. For s=2013, k=2013/2013 *m*n=1*m*n. Here, m and n are coprime, sum to 2013, so m and n are coprime and sum to 2013. For example, m=1, n=2012 (but gcd(1,2012)=1). Then k=1*1*2012=2012. Similarly, m=2, n=2011 (prime), k=2*2011=4022. But these k's are different from the ones obtained from smaller s. So no overlap. Similarly, s=3's k=1342 is unique. Therefore, the total number of k's is indeed 1006.However, considering that 2013 is 3*11*61, which are all primes, then the number of divisors is 8. Each divisor s gives φ(s)/2 k's, and sum of φ(s)/2 over all s | 2013, s >1 is 1006. So the answer should be boxed{1006}.But I need to check if there's a different approach. Another way: note that k must be a multiple of 2013/s for some s | 2013, and that m*n must be an integer such that (m + n) divides 2013*m*n. But since m and n are coprime, m + n divides 2013. Then for each divisor s of 2013, the number of k's is the number of distinct (2013/s)*m*n where m + n = s and gcd(m, n)=1. Since m and n are coprime to s, and s is a divisor of 2013, and 2013/s is coprime to s, then m and n can be any coprime pair adding to s. Each such pair gives a unique product m*n, hence a unique k. But wait, but if m and n are swapped, they give the same product. Hence, for each s, the number of distinct k's is φ(s)/2, which is the same as before.Therefore, I think the answer is 1006. However, this seems very large, but given the prime factors of 2013, which are three distinct primes, the number of divisors is 8, and the totient functions of those divisors sum up to 1200 for s=2013, leading to 600 k's from that divisor alone.Therefore, unless there is a hidden constraint I'm missing, the answer should be 1006.But the problem is from an Olympiad, which might have a more elegant answer. Let me think again.Alternative approach:The equation is k/(2013)(a + b) = lcm(a, b). Let’s denote d = gcd(a, b), so a = d*x, b = d*y, with gcd(x, y) = 1. Then lcm(a, b) = d*x*y. Substitute into the equation:k/(2013)(d(x + y)) = d*x*y => k/(2013)(x + y) = x*y => k = (2013*x*y)/(x + y)Therefore, k must be equal to 2013 times the product of two coprime integers divided by their sum. So we need to find all positive integers k such that there exist coprime x, y with k = (2013*x*y)/(x + y).Let’s denote s = x + y, so k = 2013*x*y/s. Since x and y are coprime, x and y must also be coprime to s = x + y. Therefore, s must divide 2013*x*y. But since x and y are coprime to s, s must divide 2013. Therefore, s is a positive divisor of 2013.As before, s can be any divisor of 2013 greater than 1 (since x and y are positive integers). For each divisor s, we can write x and y as coprime integers adding up to s. The number of such pairs is φ(s), but since (x, y) and (y, x) give the same product x*y, the number of distinct products is φ(s)/2. Therefore, the total number of distinct k is the sum of φ(s)/2 for each divisor s of 2013 greater than 1.As calculated earlier, this sum is 1 + 5 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 300 + 600 = 1006.Therefore, the answer is boxed{1006}.Final Answerboxed{1006}</think>To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers ( k ) such that the equation [frac{k}{2013}(a + b) = operatorname{lcm}(a, b)]has a solution in positive integers ( (a, b) ).First, we use the relationship between the least common multiple (lcm) and the greatest common divisor (gcd). For any positive integers ( a ) and ( b ), we have:[operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = frac{ab}{gcd(a, b)}]Let ( d = gcd(a, b) ), and write ( a = d cdot m ) and ( b = d cdot n ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime. Substituting these into the equation, we get:[frac{k}{2013}(d(m + n)) = frac{d cdot m cdot n}{d}]Simplifying, we find:[k cdot (m + n) = 2013 cdot m cdot n]This implies:[k = frac{2013 cdot m cdot n}{m + n}]Here, ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime positive integers, and ( m + n ) must be a divisor of 2013. The divisors of 2013 are ( 1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013 ). Since ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers, ( m + n ) must be at least 2, so we exclude 1.For each divisor ( s ) of 2013 (excluding 1), we need to count the number of pairs ( (m, n) ) such that ( m + n = s ) and ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ). The number of such pairs is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(s) ). Since each pair ( (m, n) ) and ( (n, m) ) gives the same product ( m cdot n ), we divide by 2.Summing ( frac{phi(s)}{2} ) for each divisor ( s ) of 2013 (excluding 1), we get:[begin{aligned}&phi(3)/2 = 2/2 = 1, &phi(11)/2 = 10/2 = 5, &phi(33)/2 = 20/2 = 10, &phi(61)/2 = 60/2 = 30, &phi(183)/2 = 120/2 = 60, &phi(671)/2 = 600/2 = 300, &phi(2013)/2 = 1200/2 = 600.end{aligned}]Summing these values:[1 + 5 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 300 + 600 = 1006]Thus, the number of positive integers ( k ) is (boxed{1006}).,<think>Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. The question is asking: How many positive integers k are there such that the equation (k/2013)(a + b) = lcm(a, b) has a solution in positive integers (a, b). Hmm, so first, I need to recall what the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is. The lcm of two numbers a and b is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. Also, there's a relationship between lcm and gcd (greatest common divisor). The formula is lcm(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = a * b. Maybe that will come in handy here.The equation given is (k/2013)(a + b) = lcm(a, b). Let me rewrite that to make it clearer. Multiply both sides by 2013 to eliminate the fraction:k(a + b) = 2013 * lcm(a, b)So we need to find all positive integers k such that there exist positive integers a and b satisfying this equation.I think the key here is to relate lcm(a, b) to a and b using their gcd. Let me denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, we can write a = d * x and b = d * y, where x and y are coprime positive integers (since we've factored out the gcd). Then, lcm(a, b) = d * x * y, because lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b) = (d * x * d * y) / d = d * x * y.Substituting a and b into the equation:k(d x + d y) = 2013 * d x ySimplify the left side: k d(x + y) = 2013 d x yWe can divide both sides by d (since d is a positive integer, it's non-zero):k(x + y) = 2013 x ySo now the equation is k(x + y) = 2013 x y, where x and y are coprime positive integers.So our problem reduces to finding the number of positive integers k such that there exist coprime positive integers x and y where k = (2013 x y)/(x + y)So k must be equal to 2013 times the product of x and y divided by their sum, where x and y are coprime. We need to find all such k.Alternatively, rearranged, k = 2013 * (x y)/(x + y). Since x and y are coprime, maybe we can analyze this fraction.Let me denote s = x + y and p = x y. Then k = 2013 * p / s. Since x and y are coprime, we can recall that x and y are coprime if and only if they are coprime with their sum s. Wait, actually, if x and y are coprime, then any common divisor of x and s would divide y = s - x, so since gcd(x, y) = 1, gcd(x, s) must be 1. Similarly, gcd(y, s) = 1. Therefore, x and y are each coprime with s.But s = x + y. Hmm, perhaps this is useful. Also, since x and y are coprime, p = x y is their product. So we have that k = 2013 * (x y)/(x + y). Therefore, (x + y) divides 2013 x y. Since x and y are coprime, x + y divides 2013.Wait, let me check that again. If x and y are coprime, then x + y divides 2013? Hmm, let's see. Since x and y are coprime, then x and y are coprime to x + y as well. So x + y divides 2013 times x y. But because x and y are coprime to x + y, then x + y must divide 2013. Because any common divisor of x + y and x y must divide 2013. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.If x and y are coprime, then x and x + y are coprime. Because any common divisor d of x and x + y would also divide y, since d divides (x + y) - x = y. But since x and y are coprime, d must be 1. Similarly, y and x + y are coprime. Therefore, gcd(x y, x + y) = 1. Therefore, since x + y divides 2013 x y, and gcd(x + y, x y) = 1, then x + y must divide 2013. Yes, that seems right. Because if m divides a product bc and m is coprime to b, then m divides c. In this case, m = x + y, b = x y, c = 2013. Since gcd(m, b) = 1, m divides 2013. Therefore, x + y divides 2013.Therefore, s = x + y is a divisor of 2013. So first, let's factorize 2013 to find all its divisors.2013 divided by 3 is 671. Then, 671 divided by 11 is 61. 61 is prime. So 2013 factors into 3 * 11 * 61. Therefore, the number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8. So divisors of 2013 are all combinations of these primes:1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013.So s can be any of these divisors. Therefore, s is in {1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013}.But x and y are positive integers such that x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1. Since x and y are positive integers, x and y must be less than s, and since x + y = s, both x and y are at least 1. So for each s, which is a divisor of 2013, we can find pairs (x, y) where x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1.But actually, since x and y are positive integers with x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1, the number of such pairs is φ(s), where φ is Euler's totient function? Wait, no. Wait, φ(s) counts the numbers less than s that are coprime to s. But in our case, x and y are positive integers such that x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1. Let me see.For each s, the number of pairs (x, y) where x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1 is equal to φ(s), because for x in [1, s-1], y = s - x, and gcd(x, s - x) = gcd(x, s). Since we need gcd(x, s - x) = 1, which is equivalent to gcd(x, s) = 1. Therefore, the number of such pairs is φ(s). However, since (x, y) and (y, x) are considered the same pair if order doesn't matter, but in our case, since a and b are ordered (they are just two positive integers), so maybe we consider ordered pairs. Wait, in the original problem, a and b are ordered, so (a, b) and (b, a) are different solutions unless a = b. But in our substitution, we set a = d x and b = d y, so x and y are coprime. So (x, y) and (y, x) would lead to different (a, b) unless x = y. Therefore, in terms of k, does it matter? Let me see.In the expression k = 2013 * (x y)/(x + y), switching x and y doesn't change the value of k. Therefore, even if (x, y) and (y, x) lead to the same k. Therefore, when we count the number of distinct k's, we need to consider that different pairs (x, y) could lead to the same k. However, perhaps each s gives a unique k? Wait, let's see.Wait, for each s (divisor of 2013), we have pairs (x, y) where x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1. Then, for each such pair, k = 2013 * (x y)/s. So x y is equal to x (s - x) = s x - x². Then, k = 2013 * (s x - x²)/s = 2013 * (x - x²/s). But since s divides 2013, and x and s are coprime (as earlier, since gcd(x, s) = 1), x²/s would not necessarily be an integer. Wait, but k must be an integer. So since k is equal to 2013 * x y / s, and x y must be divisible by s / gcd(2013, s). Wait, no. Let me think again.Wait, 2013 is fixed. For each divisor s of 2013, we have k = (2013 * x y)/s. But x and y are positive integers with x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1. Since x and y are coprime and x + y = s, as earlier, x and y are coprime to s. Therefore, x and y are coprime to s. So x and s are coprime, y and s are coprime. So in the expression (x y)/s, since x and y are coprime to s, the product x y is coprime to s as well. Therefore, s must divide 2013, and (x y)/s must be an integer? Wait, no. Wait, x and y are coprime to s, so x y is coprime to s. Therefore, unless s divides 2013, which it does, s divides 2013, and so 2013/s is an integer. Then, k = (2013/s) * x y. Since x y is an integer, k is an integer.Therefore, for each s (divisor of 2013), and each pair (x, y) with x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1, we have k = (2013/s) * x y. Therefore, k must be a multiple of 2013/s multiplied by x y. Since x and y are coprime and x + y = s, and x and y are coprime to s, so x y is coprime to s. Therefore, gcd(x y, s) = 1. Therefore, 2013/s and x y are coprime? Let's see.Wait, 2013 factors into 3 * 11 * 61. So s is a divisor of 2013, so s is a product of some combination of 3, 11, 61. Then 2013/s is the complementary factors. For example, if s = 3, then 2013/s = 11*61 = 671. Then, x y is coprime to s = 3, so x y is coprime to 3, so 2013/s * x y = 671 * x y, which is an integer. Since x y can be any integer coprime to 3. But in this case, since x and y are positive integers adding to s = 3, and coprime, the possible pairs (x, y) are (1, 2) and (2, 1). Then, x y = 1 * 2 = 2. Therefore, k = 671 * 2 = 1342. So for s = 3, k is 1342. Similarly, for other s.Wait, so for each s, the possible k's are (2013/s) multiplied by x y, where x and y are coprime and x + y = s. But x y varies depending on x and y. However, since x and y are coprime and x + y = s, which is a divisor of 2013, and x and y are coprime to s, then for each s, the product x y can be different. Therefore, different pairs (x, y) for the same s may lead to different k's. Wait, but maybe not. For example, in the case of s = 3, x and y can only be 1 and 2, so x y is always 2. Therefore, for s = 3, k is uniquely determined as 2013/3 * 2 = 671 * 2 = 1342.Similarly, let's take another s, say s = 11. Then, possible pairs (x, y) where x + y = 11 and gcd(x, y) = 1. The pairs would be (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). But we need to check which of these pairs have gcd(x, y) = 1.Check (1,10): gcd(1,10)=1. Good.(2,9): gcd(2,9)=1. Good.(3,8): gcd(3,8)=1. Good.(4,7): gcd(4,7)=1. Good.(5,6): gcd(5,6)=1. Good.Similarly, the rest are reverses, so same gcd. So there are 5 distinct pairs (if unordered) or 10 ordered pairs. But since x and y are ordered, in our original problem, they are ordered. So for each s = 11, we have 10 pairs, but x y will take values:1*10=10, 2*9=18, 3*8=24, 4*7=28, 5*6=30.But since (x, y) and (y, x) will give the same product, so x y can be 10, 18, 24, 28, 30. Therefore, for s = 11, k = (2013 / 11) * x y = 183 * x y. Therefore, k can be 183*10=1830, 183*18=3294, 183*24=4392, 183*28=5124, 183*30=5490. So these are 5 distinct values for k from s = 11.Wait, but 183*10 is 1830, but 183 is 2013/11 = 183. So each s gives some multiples. Therefore, each divisor s of 2013 will lead to several k's, depending on the x y products. Therefore, the total number of k's is the number of distinct values of (2013/s) * x y, where s is a divisor of 2013, and x, y are coprime positive integers with x + y = s.So our task is to go through each divisor s of 2013, find all possible x y products for coprime pairs (x, y) with x + y = s, multiply each product by 2013/s, and collect all distinct values.But maybe there is a smarter way rather than enumerating all divisors. Let's see.First, let's list all divisors of 2013:1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, 2013.Now, for each s in this list, compute the possible x y products where x + y = s and gcd(x, y) = 1. Then, multiply by 2013/s to get k. Then collect all such k and count distinct ones.Let me start with s = 1.s = 1: x + y = 1. But x and y are positive integers, so the only possibility is x=1, y=0 or x=0, y=1. But y must be positive. Therefore, no solution. So s=1 gives no k.s = 3: x + y = 3. Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,1). Both have gcd 1. So x y = 1*2 = 2. Therefore, k = (2013 / 3) * 2 = 671 * 2 = 1342.s = 11: As before, possible x y products: 10,18,24,28,30. So k = 183 * 10 = 1830; 183*18=3294; 183*24=4392; 183*28=5124; 183*30=5490. So five k's here.s = 33: x + y = 33, gcd(x, y) = 1. So we need to find all pairs (x, y) where x + y = 33 and gcd(x, 33) = 1 (since gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, 33 - x) = gcd(x, 33)). Therefore, the number of such pairs is φ(33). φ(33) = φ(3*11) = (3-1)(11-1) = 2*10 = 20. But since x and y are ordered pairs, there are 20 ordered pairs. However, the products x y will be symmetrical. Let's compute the possible products.Wait, x can be from 1 to 32, but coprime with 33. So x must not be divisible by 3 or 11. The numbers from 1 to 32 not divisible by 3 or 11 are:1,2,4,5,7,8,10,13,14,16,17,19,20,23,25,26,28,29,31,32.So 20 numbers. Each x gives a y = 33 - x, which is also coprime to 33. So x y = x (33 - x). Let's compute these products:1*32=322*31=624*29=1165*28=1407*26=1828*25=20010*23=23013*20=26014*19=26616*17=27217*16=272 (duplicate)19*14=266 (duplicate)20*13=260 (duplicate)23*10=230 (duplicate)25*8=200 (duplicate)26*7=182 (duplicate)28*5=140 (duplicate)29*4=116 (duplicate)31*2=62 (duplicate)32*1=32 (duplicate)So the distinct products are: 32,62,116,140,182,200,230,260,266,272. So 10 distinct products. Therefore, for s = 33, k = (2013 / 33) * product. 2013 / 33 = 61. Therefore, k = 61 * each product:61*32=195261*62=378261*116=707661*140=854061*182=1110261*200=1220061*230=1403061*260=1586061*266=1622661*272=16592So 10 distinct k's from s = 33.s = 61: x + y = 61, gcd(x, y) = 1. Similarly, x and y must be coprime to 61. Wait, 61 is prime. So x + y = 61, and x and y are positive integers coprime to each other. Since 61 is prime, as long as x is not 0 mod 61, then gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, 61 - x) = gcd(x, 61). Since 61 is prime, gcd(x, 61) is 1 unless x is a multiple of 61. But x ranges from 1 to 60, so none are multiples of 61. Therefore, all pairs (x, y) where x + y = 61 have gcd(x, y) = 1. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs is 60, but since x can be 1 to 60, y = 60 to 1. But the products x y will be symmetric. Let's see.The products x y for x + y = 61 are x(61 - x) = 61x - x². The products will be distinct for x from 1 to 30, and then mirror. For example, x=1: 1*60=60, x=2:2*59=118,..., x=30:30*31=930. Then x=31:31*30=930, same as x=30. Therefore, the distinct products are for x from 1 to 30. However, since we need x and y coprime, but in this case, all pairs are coprime, so all products are allowed. Wait, but since x ranges from 1 to 60, and all pairs are coprime, the products x y will be unique when x < y (i.e., x < 61 - x) which is x < 30.5. So x from 1 to 30 gives unique products. But actually, x(61 - x) is a quadratic function that peaks at x=30.5, so the products are symmetric around 30.5. Therefore, the number of distinct products is 30. However, when x=30, y=31, product=930; x=31, y=30, same product. So actually, the distinct products are 30 in number. But let me check:For s=61 (prime), the number of distinct products x y where x + y = 61 is 30. Therefore, k = (2013 / 61) * x y. 2013 / 61 = 33. So k = 33 * x y. So we have 30 distinct products, leading to 30 distinct k's. Wait, but wait, x y can be from 1*60=60 up to 30*31=930, but each product is unique? For example, x=1, product=60; x=2, product=118; x=3, product=174; and so on. Each product increases by varying amounts. So yes, all products are distinct. Wait, but actually, for x=1 and x=60, products are 60; x=2 and x=59, products are 118; etc. But since we are considering ordered pairs, but x and y are from 1 to 60, but x y is the same for x and 61 - x. Therefore, the products are symmetric. Therefore, the number of distinct products is 30 (since 61 is odd, so x and y are distinct except when x = y = 30.5, which is not integer). Therefore, 30 distinct products. Therefore, k = 33 * each product from 60 to 930 in steps. Therefore, 30 distinct k's from s=61.Wait, but let's check with specific examples:For x=1: k=33*60=1980x=2:33*118=3894x=3:33*174=5742... and so on. Each x from 1 to 30 gives a distinct product, so 30 distinct k's.s=183: x + y = 183, gcd(x, y)=1. Let's factor s=183. 183=3*61. So similar to previous cases, x and y must be coprime with 183. Therefore, x must be coprime with 3 and 61. So the number of coprime pairs is φ(183). φ(183)=φ(3*61)=φ(3)*φ(61)=2*60=120. But since x and y are ordered pairs, there are 120 ordered pairs. However, similar to the s=33 case, the products x y will have duplicates. Wait, but handling this case might be complicated. Let me think.Alternatively, since s=183=3*61, and we need x and y such that x + y = 183 and gcd(x, y)=1. Since gcd(x, y)=1, then gcd(x, 183)=1, because any common divisor of x and 183 would divide y=183 - x, hence divide gcd(x, y)=1. Therefore, x and y must be coprime to 3 and 61. So x can be any number from 1 to 182 that is coprime to 3 and 61. The number of such x is φ(183)=120. Each such x gives a distinct y=183 - x, and since x and y are coprime, the products x y will be unique in some way. However, due to the symmetry, products will repeat when x and y are swapped. So the number of distinct products is 60 (since 120 ordered pairs, 60 unordered pairs). But is that correct? Let's see.Actually, for each unordered pair {x, y}, there are two ordered pairs (x, y) and (y, x), except when x=y. But since x + y = 183, which is odd, x and y cannot be equal. Therefore, all pairs are unordered {x, y} with x ≠ y, so the number of unordered pairs is 60. Therefore, the number of distinct products x y is 60. Therefore, k = (2013 / 183) * x y. 2013 / 183 = 11. Therefore, k = 11 * x y. So each product x y is unique, leading to 60 distinct k's? Wait, but products can still overlap even if pairs are different. For example, different pairs {x, y} and {u, v} might have x y = u v even if they are different pairs. So the number of distinct products might be less than 60.This is getting complicated. Maybe we need a different approach. Let's consider that for s=183, x and y are coprime to 3 and 61, so x and y are in [1, 182] and coprime to 3 and 61. The products x y can be anything, but since 11 is a factor in 2013/s = 11, maybe k is 11 * x y. But to find the number of distinct k's, we need to know how many distinct x y there are. Since x and y are coprime to 3 and 61, but x and y can still have other common factors? Wait, no. Since gcd(x, y)=1, so x and y are coprime. Therefore, x and y are coprime, and both coprime to 3 and 61. Therefore, their product x y is coprime to 3 and 61 as well. Therefore, x y is coprime to 3*61=183. Therefore, x y can be any number coprime to 183. However, when multiplied by 11, k = 11 * x y, so k must be multiples of 11, and coprime to 183. But since 11 and 183 are coprime (183=3*61), then k is of the form 11 * m where m is coprime to 183. But m can be any number coprime to 183? Wait, but x y is not arbitrary. Because x and y are positive integers such that x + y = 183, which is fixed. So x y is not arbitrary. So this line of thought might not be helpful.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize x and y. Let me try specific examples. Take x=1: then y=182. But gcd(1,182)=1. Then x y = 1*182=182. k=11*182=2002.x=2: y=181. gcd(2,181)=1. x y=362. k=11*362=3982.x=4: y=179. gcd(4,179)=1. x y=716. k=11*716=7876.x=5: y=178. gcd(5,178)=1. x y=890. k=11*890=9790.x=7: y=176. Wait, y=176, but 176 is divisible by 11 and 16. Wait, but x=7, y=176. gcd(7,176)=1. Yes, because 176 is 16*11, and 7 is coprime to both 16 and 11. So x y=7*176=1232. k=11*1232=13552.Wait, but as we can see, each x gives a distinct product. For example, x=1 gives 182, x=2 gives 362, x=4 gives 716, etc. These products are all distinct. Therefore, if all x y products are unique, then k=11*x y would also be unique, leading to 60 distinct k's (since 60 unordered pairs, but since k is the same for (x, y) and (y, x), but in ordered pairs they are considered different but give same k). Wait, but no, in our case, even though (x, y) and (y, x) give same product x y, hence same k. So if we consider unordered pairs, then the number of distinct k's would be equal to the number of distinct products x y. But in this case, when x ranges from 1 to 91 (since 183/2=91.5), the products x y will be unique. Wait, but how can we be sure?Actually, suppose that x y = u v where x + y = u + v = 183. Then, we can write:x(183 - x) = u(183 - u)So 183x - x² = 183u - u²Therefore, x² - u² = 183(x - u)(x - u)(x + u) = 183(x - u)If x ≠ u, then we can divide both sides by (x - u), getting x + u = 183.But x + u = 183, and since x + y = 183, then u = 183 - x. Then y = 183 - x, so u = y. Therefore, the only solutions where x y = u v are when u = x or u = y. Therefore, each product x y is unique except when u = y. Therefore, for x ≠ y, the products are unique. Since x and y are distinct (because 183 is odd), all products are unique. Therefore, the number of distinct products x y is equal to the number of unordered pairs, which is φ(183)/2 = 120/2 = 60. Therefore, 60 distinct products. Therefore, 60 distinct k's from s=183.Therefore, for s=183, k=11*x y, with 60 distinct values.s=671: x + y = 671, gcd(x, y)=1. Let's factor s=671. 671 divided by 11 is 61. So 671=11*61. So similar to previous cases.x and y must be coprime with 671, which factors into 11 and 61. Therefore, φ(671)=φ(11)*φ(61)=10*60=600. Therefore, there are 600 ordered pairs (x, y). But again, due to symmetry, the number of distinct products x y is 300. But similar to the s=183 case, if we can show that x y is unique for each unordered pair, then the number of distinct k's would be 300. But let's check.Suppose x y = u v with x + y = u + v = 671. Then:x(671 - x) = u(671 - u)Which leads to x² - u² = 671(x - u)(x - u)(x + u) = 671(x - u)If x ≠ u, then x + u = 671. Therefore, u = 671 - x. Then, y = 671 - x = u. So the only duplicate products come from swapping x and y. Therefore, each product x y is unique for each unordered pair. Therefore, the number of distinct products is 300. Therefore, k = (2013 / 671) * x y. 2013 / 671 = 3. Therefore, k=3*x y. Since there are 300 distinct x y products, there are 300 distinct k's from s=671.s=2013: x + y = 2013, gcd(x, y)=1. Let's factor s=2013=3*11*61. Similarly, φ(2013)=φ(3)*φ(11)*φ(61)=2*10*60=1200. So there are 1200 ordered pairs (x, y) where x + y = 2013 and gcd(x, y)=1. The number of distinct products x y would be 600, since each unordered pair is counted twice. Then k = (2013 / 2013)*x y = x y. Therefore, k = x y, where x + y = 2013 and gcd(x, y)=1. So we need to count the number of distinct products x y where x + y = 2013 and gcd(x, y)=1.But similar to the previous cases, if we assume that the products are unique for each unordered pair, then the number of distinct k's would be 600. However, to confirm, suppose x y = u v with x + y = u + v = 2013. Then:x(2013 - x)=u(2013 - u)Which leads to x² - u² =2013(x - u)(x - u)(x + u)=2013(x - u)If x ≠ u, then x + u=2013, so u=2013 - x. Then y=2013 - x=u. Therefore, the only duplicates come from swapping x and y. Hence, the number of distinct products is indeed 600. Therefore, k = x y, with 600 distinct values.Now, summarizing all the possible k's from each s:- s=1: none- s=3: 1 k- s=11: 5 k's- s=33: 10 k's- s=61: 30 k's- s=183: 60 k's- s=671: 300 k's- s=2013: 600 k'sTotal number of k's would be 1 + 5 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 300 + 600. Let's compute:1 + 5 = 66 + 10 = 1616 + 30 = 4646 + 60 = 106106 + 300 = 406406 + 600 = 1006But wait, before accepting this, we need to check if there are any overlaps between the k's from different s's. For example, could a k from s=3 also be generated by another s? For example, k=1342 from s=3. Is this possible to get the same k from another s?For example, take k=1342. From s=3, this is 2013/3 * 2 = 671*2=1342. Could there be another s where 2013/s * x y =1342? Let's see. Then x y = 1342/(2013/s) = 1342*s/2013. Since 1342=2*11*61. Let's check if 1342*s/2013 is integer. 2013=3*11*61. So 1342*s must be divisible by 3*11*61. Since 1342=2*11*61, so 1342*s =2*11*61*s. Therefore, 1342*s divided by 2013 is (2*11*61*s)/(3*11*61)=2s/3. So 2s/3 must be integer. Therefore, s must be a multiple of 3. So possible s=3,33,183, 2013. Let's check s=3: x y=2*3/3=2. Which is what we have. For s=33: x y=2*33/3=22. So 22 must be a product of coprime x and y with x + y =33. Is there such a pair?Looking back at s=33: products were 32,62,116,140,182,200,230,260,266,272. 22 is not among them. Therefore, no. For s=183: x y=2*183/3=122. But in s=183, x y ranges from 1*182=182 up. So 122 is too small. Similarly for s=2013, x y would be 2*2013/3=1342. But in s=2013, x and y must be coprime and sum to 2013. Is there x, y such that x + y=2013, gcd(x,y)=1, and x y=1342? Let's check. But x y=1342, and x + y=2013. Then, the quadratic equation: t^2 -2013 t +1342=0. The discriminant is 2013² -4*1342. Let's compute:2013² is large, 4*1342=5368. 2013²= approx (2000 +13)^2=2000² +2*2000*13 +13²=4,000,000 +52,000 +169=4,052,169. Then 4,052,169 -5,368=4,046,801. The square root of 4,046,801 is 2011.65..., which is not integer. Therefore, no integer solutions. Therefore, x y=1342 is impossible for s=2013. Therefore, k=1342 is unique to s=3.Similarly, check another k from s=11. For example, k=1830 from s=11: 183*10=1830. Can this be achieved by another s?Suppose 2013/s * x y=1830. Then x y=1830*s/2013. 2013=3*11*61. 1830=2*3*5*61. Therefore, x y=1830*s/(3*11*61)= (2*5)*s/11=10*s/11. So 10*s must be divisible by 11. Therefore, s must be divisible by 11. So s=11,33, 671,2013. Check s=11: x y=10*11/11=10. Which is the original case. For s=33: x y=10*33/11=30. In s=33, the products include 32,62,116,...30 isn't in the list (products are 32,62,116,140,182,200,230,260,266,272). Wait, 230 is there. Wait, 230 is 10*23, but x+y=33. So x=10, y=23, which are coprime. But 10*23=230, which would give k=61*230=14030. Wait, but 10*s/11=10*33/11=30, so x y=30. But in s=33, x=5 and y=28, product=140, then k=61*140=8540. Wait, but 30 is not among the products. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my previous logic might have an error.Wait, actually, the equation x y=10*s/11=30 for s=33. But in s=33, the pairs are x and y coprime, x + y=33. So if x y=30, then x and y are roots of t^2 -33 t +30=0. The discriminant is 33² -120=1089 -120=969. Which is not a perfect square. Therefore, x and y are not integers. Therefore, there's no pair (x, y) in s=33 with x y=30. Therefore, k=1830 is unique to s=11.Therefore, it seems that k's from different s's are distinct. Is this generally the case?Suppose we have two different divisors s1 and s2 of 2013. If there exists a k that can be written as (2013/s1) * x1 y1 and also as (2013/s2) * x2 y2, then we must have:(2013/s1) * x1 y1 = (2013/s2) * x2 y2=> (x1 y1)/s1 = (x2 y2)/s2But x1 + y1 = s1, x2 + y2 = s2, and x1, y1 coprime, x2, y2 coprime.Is this possible?Suppose s1 ≠ s2. Let me take s1=3 and s2=11. Then k from s1 is (2013/3)*x1 y1=671*x1 y1. From s1=3, x1 y1=2, so k=1342. From s2=11, k=183*x2 y2. So 1342=183*x2 y2 => x2 y2=1342/183≈7.33, which is not an integer. Therefore, no overlap.Similarly, take k=1830 from s=11. Suppose this equals k from s=33. Then 1830=61*x y. So x y=1830/61=30. But in s=33, x y=30 would require x and y such that x + y=33 and x y=30, which we saw is impossible. Therefore, no overlap.Similarly, take k=1952 from s=33 (61*32=1952). Suppose this is also a k from s=61. Then 1952=33*x y => x y=1952/33≈59.15, which is not integer. So no overlap.Another example, take k=3782 from s=33 (61*62=3782). Check if this can come from s=61: 33*x y=3782 => x y≈114.6, not integer. No.Similarly, k from s=61: 33*60=1980. Check s=183: 11*x y=1980 => x y=180. But in s=183, x y=180 would require x + y=183 and x y=180. Solving quadratic: t² -183 t +180=0. Discriminant=183² -720=33489 -720=32769. sqrt(32769)=181.02..., not integer. So no solution. Therefore, no overlap.Similarly, k from s=183: 11* x y. Take k=2002 (11*182). Check if exists in s=671:3*x y=2002 => x y≈667.33, not integer. So no overlap.Similarly, k from s=671: 3*x y. Suppose k=3*1000=3000. Check if exists in s=2013: x y=3000. But x + y=2013 and x y=3000. Solve t² -2013 t +3000=0. Discriminant=2013² -12000=... Not a square. So no.Therefore, it appears that k's from different s's are distinct. Therefore, the total number of k's is indeed the sum over each s of the number of distinct k's from that s, which is 1 +5 +10 +30 +60 +300 +600=1006.But wait, let me verify once more.s=3:1s=11:5s=33:10s=61:30s=183:60s=671:300s=2013:600Total:1+5=6; 6+10=16;16+30=46;46+60=106;106+300=406;406+600=1006.Yes, 1006. But the problem is asking for the number of positive integers k. But before finalizing, we need to make sure that all k's are positive integers, which they are, because for each s, x y is a positive integer, and 2013/s is also an integer.Therefore, the answer should be 1006. But wait, this seems very large. Let me check once more.Wait, the problem states: \\"How many positive integers k are there such that [equation] has a solution in positive integers (a, b)\\". The equation is equivalent to k = (2013 * lcm(a, b))/(a + b). Since a and b are positive integers, lcm(a, b) is at least 1, so k is at least 2013/(a + b). But a and b are positive integers, so a + b is at least 2, so k is at least 2013/2 ≈1006.5. Wait, but this contradicts our previous calculation where we have k=1342,1830, etc., which are larger than 1006.5, but according to our sum, the minimal k is 1342, and maximal k is something like 2013* (2012)/2? Wait, no. For s=2013, the maximal x y is (2012/2)*(2012/2 +1) if x and y are consecutive numbers. Wait, but s=2013, x and y can be 1 and 2012, giving product 2012. Then k=2012. Or x=1006, y=1007, product=1006*1007=1,013,042. Then k=1,013,042. So k can be up to around a million. But the problem is asking how many such k's exist. If our previous calculation is correct, there are 1006 distinct k's. But 1006 seems plausible?Wait, but when s=2013, we have 600 distinct k's. Then s=671 gives 300, s=183 gives 60, s=61 gives30, etc. So adding up gives 1006. But is this correct?Alternatively, recall that for each s (divisor of 2013), the number of k's is equal to the number of distinct x y products for coprime pairs (x, y) with x + y = s. Then, the total number of k's is the sum over all s | 2013, s >1, of the number of distinct x y products for each s.But we saw that:- s=3:1 k- s=11:5 k's- s=33:10 k's- s=61:30 k's- s=183:60 k's- s=671:300 k's- s=2013:600 k'sTotal:1+5+10+30+60+300+600=1006.Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation in the number of distinct x y products for each s, the answer is 1006.But let's cross-validate this with another approach. Since the number of solutions is equal to the sum_{s | 2013, s >1} (φ(s)/2). Because for each s, the number of coprime pairs (x, y) with x + y =s is φ(s), which counts ordered pairs. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs is φ(s)/2. But since each unordered pair corresponds to a unique k, as (x, y) and (y, x) give the same product x y. Therefore, the total number of k's would be sum_{s | 2013, s >1} φ(s)/2. Let's compute this.Divisors of 2013:1,3,11,33,61,183,671,2013. Exclude s=1.For each s>1:s=3: φ(3)=2, so φ(s)/2=1s=11:φ(11)=10, φ(s)/2=5s=33:φ(33)=20, φ(s)/2=10s=61:φ(61)=60, φ(s)/2=30s=183:φ(183)=120, φ(s)/2=60s=671:φ(671)=600, φ(s)/2=300s=2013:φ(2013)=φ(3*11*61)=2*10*60=1200, φ(s)/2=600Summing these:1+5+10+30+60+300+600=1006. Exactly the same as before. Therefore, this confirms the result.Therefore, the number of positive integers k is 1006.Final Answerboxed{1006}</think>To determine the number of positive integers ( k ) such that the equation (frac{k}{2013}(a + b) = operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) has a solution in positive integers ((a, b)), we start by rewriting the equation as ( k(a + b) = 2013 cdot operatorname{lcm}(a, b) ).Using the relationship between the least common multiple (lcm) and the greatest common divisor (gcd), we express ( a ) and ( b ) as ( a = dx ) and ( b = dy ) where ( d = gcd(a, b) ), and ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime. This transforms the equation into ( k(d(x + y)) = 2013 cdot dxy ), simplifying to ( k(x + y) = 2013xy ).We then need ( k = frac{2013xy}{x + y} ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime positive integers. This implies ( x + y ) must be a divisor of 2013. The divisors of 2013 are 1, 3, 11, 33, 61, 183, 671, and 2013.For each divisor ( s ), we consider pairs ((x, y)) such that ( x + y = s ) and ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ). The number of such pairs is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(s) ). Each pair contributes a distinct value of ( k = frac{2013}{s} cdot xy ).The number of distinct values of ( k ) for each divisor ( s ) is calculated as follows:- ( s = 3 ): ( phi(3) = 2 ) pairs, leading to 1 distinct ( k )- ( s = 11 ): ( phi(11) = 10 ) pairs, leading to 5 distinct ( k )- ( s = 33 ): ( phi(33) = 20 ) pairs, leading to 10 distinct ( k )- ( s = 61 ): ( phi(61) = 60 ) pairs, leading to 30 distinct ( k )- ( s = 183 ): ( phi(183) = 120 ) pairs, leading to 60 distinct ( k )- ( s = 671 ): ( phi(671) = 600 ) pairs, leading to 300 distinct ( k )- ( s = 2013 ): ( phi(2013) = 1200 ) pairs, leading to 600 distinct ( k )Summing these results, we get the total number of distinct ( k ):[1 + 5 + 10 + 30 + 60 + 300 + 600 = 1006]Thus, the number of positive integers ( k ) is (boxed{1006}).]"},{"problem":"4.

I need to find the smallest prime ( p ) that satisfies this condition. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.First, let's understand the expression ( p^{3} - 6 p^{2} + 9 p ). Since ( p ) is a prime number, maybe I can factor this expression to simplify it. Factoring might help me analyze the number of divisors more easily.Starting with the given polynomial:[p^{3} - 6 p^{2} + 9 p]I notice that each term has a factor of ( p ), so let's factor that out first:[p(p^{2} - 6p + 9)]Now, looking at the quadratic ( p^{2} - 6p + 9 ). Hmm, can that be factored further? Let's check the discriminant to see if it factors nicely. The quadratic is ( ax^2 + bx + c ) where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -6 ), ( c = 9 ). The discriminant is ( b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0 ). Oh, discriminant is zero, so it's a perfect square. Therefore, the quadratic factors as:[(p - 3)^2]So, putting it all together, the original expression factors as:[p(p - 3)^2]Therefore, ( p^{3} - 6 p^{2} + 9 p = p(p - 3)^2 ).Now, since we need this expression to have exactly 30 positive divisors, we need to find the prime ( p ) such that the number of divisors (also called the divisor function) of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) is 30.First, let's recall that if a number ( n ) has the prime factorization ( n = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} dots q_k^{a_k} ), then the number of positive divisors of ( n ) is ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) dots (a_k + 1) ).So, in our case, we need to find the prime ( p ) such that the number of divisors of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) is 30. Let's consider the prime factorization of ( p(p - 3)^2 ).Since ( p ) is prime, there are two possibilities here:1. ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) are coprime (i.e., they share no common factors).2. ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) are not coprime, meaning they share a common factor.But wait, ( p ) is a prime number. The only divisors of ( p ) are 1 and ( p ). So, for ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) to share a common factor, that common factor must be ( p ). But ( p - 3 ) is ( p ) minus 3, which is 3 less than ( p ). Since ( p ) is a prime greater than 3 (otherwise, if ( p = 3 ), then ( p - 3 = 0 ), which would complicate things), the difference between ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) is 3, so if ( p ) divides ( p - 3 ), then ( p ) divides 3. But ( p ) is a prime, so the only primes dividing 3 are 3 itself. Therefore, ( p = 3 ).But wait, if ( p = 3 ), then ( p - 3 = 0 ), so the expression becomes ( 3 times 0^2 = 0 ). But 0 has infinitely many divisors, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, ( p = 3 ) is invalid. Hence, ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) must be coprime for all primes ( p ) except possibly when ( p = 3 ), which we just saw isn't valid. Therefore, for primes ( p neq 3 ), ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) are coprime.Therefore, the prime factorization of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) is ( p times (p - 3)^2 ), where ( p ) is a prime and ( p - 3 ) is some integer. However, ( p - 3 ) may not be prime, so we need to consider its prime factors.But since ( p ) is a prime number, and ( p - 3 ) is 3 less than a prime. Depending on the value of ( p ), ( p - 3 ) could be composite or prime. For example, if ( p = 5 ), then ( p - 3 = 2 ), which is prime. If ( p = 7 ), then ( p - 3 = 4 ), which is composite. So, in some cases, ( p - 3 ) is prime, and in others, it's composite.Therefore, the structure of the prime factors of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) will depend on whether ( p - 3 ) is prime or composite.So, to compute the number of divisors, we need to consider the prime factorization of ( p(p - 3)^2 ). Let's break it down into two cases:Case 1: ( p - 3 ) is prime. Let's call this prime ( q ). Then, ( p = q + 3 ). Then, the expression becomes ( (q + 3) times q^2 ). Since ( q + 3 ) and ( q ) are two different primes (since ( q ) and ( q + 3 ) are primes differing by 3, and if ( q = 2 ), then ( q + 3 = 5 ), which is prime; if ( q = 3 ), ( q + 3 = 6 ), not prime; ( q = 5 ), ( q + 3 = 8 ), not prime; etc.), except when ( q = 2 ), ( q + 3 = 5 ). So in this case, ( p = 5 ), since ( p = q + 3 = 5 ). Let me verify that.Wait, if ( p - 3 ) is prime, say ( q ), then ( q = p - 3 ), so ( p = q + 3 ). So ( p ) is a prime that is 3 more than another prime ( q ). So primes ( p ) such that ( p - 3 ) is also prime. These are primes that are part of a prime pair with difference 3. The first few such primes are 5 (since 5 - 3 = 2, which is prime), 7 (7 - 3 = 4, not prime), 11 (11 - 3 = 8, not prime), 13 (13 - 3 = 10, not prime), 17 (17 - 3 = 14, not prime), 19 (19 - 3 = 16, not prime), 23 (23 - 3 = 20, not prime), etc. So only ( p = 5 ) in the early primes. So perhaps only 5?Wait, let's check: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. For each, subtract 3: 2 (prime), 4 (non-prime), 8 (non-prime), 10 (non-prime), 14 (non-prime), 16 (non-prime), 20 (non-prime), 26 (non-prime), etc. So yes, only ( p = 5 ) in the primes up to 30. Therefore, if ( p - 3 ) is prime, then ( p = 5 ).Case 2: ( p - 3 ) is composite. Then, ( p - 3 ) can be factored into primes, say ( q_1^{a} q_2^{b} dots q_k^{c} ). Therefore, the expression ( p(p - 3)^2 ) would have the prime factors ( p ) and the prime factors of ( p - 3 ), each raised to twice their original exponents.Therefore, the total number of divisors would be the product of one more than each exponent in the prime factorization.So, to compute the number of divisors, we need to know the exponents in the prime factorization of ( p(p - 3)^2 ). Let's formalize this.Let ( n = p(p - 3)^2 ). Let ( p ) be a prime. Let ( m = p - 3 ). Then, ( n = p times m^2 ).If ( m ) is prime, then ( n = p times m^2 ), where ( p ) and ( m ) are distinct primes (since ( p = m + 3 ), and if ( m ) is a prime other than 2, then ( p ) would be even if ( m ) is odd and greater than 2, but primes greater than 2 are odd, so ( m + 3 ) would be even, hence not prime unless ( m = 2 ). Wait, if ( m ) is a prime, then ( p = m + 3 ). If ( m = 2 ), then ( p = 5 ). If ( m ) is another prime, say ( m = 3 ), then ( p = 6 ), which is not prime. Similarly, ( m = 5 ), ( p = 8 ), not prime. So the only case where ( m ) is prime and ( p ) is prime is ( m = 2 ), ( p = 5 ). Therefore, only in this case, ( n = 5 times 2^2 ), which is ( 5 times 4 = 20 ). The number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 times 3 = 6 ). But 6 is much less than 30, so this case doesn't satisfy the condition. So even if ( m ) is prime, ( p = 5 ), but the number of divisors is 6, not 30. Therefore, this case is invalid.Therefore, the only case that might work is when ( m = p - 3 ) is composite, so that ( m ) has multiple prime factors, leading to a higher number of divisors when squared and multiplied by ( p ).Therefore, let's focus on Case 2, where ( m = p - 3 ) is composite.So, ( n = p times m^2 ), where ( m ) is composite. Let's denote the prime factorization of ( m ) as ( q_1^{a} q_2^{b} dots q_k^{c} ). Then, ( m^2 = q_1^{2a} q_2^{2b} dots q_k^{2c} ), and since ( p ) is a prime different from all the ( q_i ) (because ( p = m + 3 ), and if ( p ) were equal to any ( q_i ), then ( q_i ) would divide ( m ), hence ( q_i ) divides ( p - 3 ), but ( q_i ) divides ( p ), so ( q_i ) divides 3. Since ( q_i ) is a prime, it must be 3. So the only case where ( p ) shares a common prime factor with ( m ) is if 3 divides both ( p ) and ( m = p - 3 ). But if 3 divides ( p ), then ( p = 3 ), but then ( m = 0 ), which is invalid. Therefore, ( p ) and ( m ) are coprime. Hence, ( p ) is a prime distinct from all prime factors of ( m ).Therefore, the prime factorization of ( n = p times m^2 ) is the product of ( p ) and the squared prime factors of ( m ). Therefore, the exponents in the prime factorization of ( n ) will be 1 for ( p ) and ( 2a, 2b, dots ) for each prime factor ( q_i ) of ( m ).Therefore, the number of divisors of ( n ) is ( (1 + 1) times (2a + 1)(2b + 1) dots (2c + 1) ), where ( a, b, dots, c ) are the exponents in the prime factorization of ( m ).We need this product to equal 30. So, ( 2 times (2a + 1)(2b + 1) dots (2c + 1) = 30 ). Therefore, ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) dots (2c + 1) = 15 ).So, our problem reduces to finding primes ( p ) such that when ( m = p - 3 ) is factored into primes, the product of ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) dots ) for its exponents equals 15, and then multiplying by 2 (for the exponent of ( p )) gives 30.Therefore, we need to find all possible factorizations of 15 as a product of integers of the form ( (2a + 1) ), where ( a ) is a positive integer. Because each ( (2a + 1) ) must be an odd integer greater than 1 (since ( a geq 1 implies 2a + 1 geq 3 )). Wait, but 15 can be factored in different ways:15 = 1515 = 5 × 315 = 3 × 5These are the possible factorizations into integers greater than 1. However, since the order doesn't matter (multiplication is commutative), these are the same.So, each factor corresponds to a different prime factor in ( m ). Let's consider the different cases:Subcase 1: ( (2a + 1) = 15 ). Then, ( a = 7 ). This would mean that ( m ) is a prime power, specifically ( q^7 ). Then, ( m = q^7 ), so ( p = q^7 + 3 ). Since ( p ) must be prime, ( q^7 + 3 ) must be prime. We can check for small primes ( q ):- ( q = 2 ): ( 2^7 + 3 = 128 + 3 = 131 ), which is prime.- ( q = 3 ): ( 3^7 + 3 = 2187 + 3 = 2190 ), which is even, not prime.- ( q = 5 ): ( 5^7 + 3 = 78125 + 3 = 78128 ), which is even, not prime.So only ( q = 2 ) gives a prime ( p = 131 ). So this is a possible candidate. But 131 is a large prime. Since we need the smallest prime ( p ), maybe there's a smaller one.Subcase 2: ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 3 times 5 ). Then, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ). This would mean that ( m ) has two distinct prime factors, one with exponent 1 and another with exponent 2. So ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 ), where ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are distinct primes. Therefore, ( p = m + 3 = q_1 times q_2^2 + 3 ). Since ( p ) must be prime, ( q_1 times q_2^2 + 3 ) must be prime.Alternatively, the exponents could be reversed, but since multiplication is commutative, it doesn't matter. So ( m ) could also be ( q_1^2 times q_2 ), but it's the same structure. So let's stick with ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 ).Our goal is to find the smallest prime ( p ), so we need the smallest primes ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) such that ( q_1 times q_2^2 + 3 ) is prime.Let's start with the smallest primes:First, take ( q_2 = 2 ), since squaring a smaller prime gives a smaller product.Then, ( q_2 = 2 implies q_2^2 = 4 ). Then ( q_1 times 4 + 3 ) must be prime. Let's choose ( q_1 = 2 ): ( 2 times 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ), which is prime. So ( p = 11 ). Wait, is this valid?Wait, ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 = 2 times 2^2 = 2 times 4 = 8 ). Then ( p = 8 + 3 = 11 ). So, let's check if 11 is prime (yes), and verify the number of divisors.Compute ( n = p(p - 3)^2 = 11 times 8^2 = 11 times 64 = 704 ). Now, prime factorization of 704: 64 is ( 2^6 ), so 704 is ( 11 times 2^6 ). Therefore, the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(6 + 1) = 2 times 7 = 14 ), which is not 30. Wait, that's a problem. So even though ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 3 times 5 = 15 ), leading to 30 divisors when multiplied by 2, in this case, the calculation resulted in 14 divisors. So something is wrong here.Wait, let me check my logic again. If ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 ), then the prime factorization of ( m ) is ( q_1 times q_2^2 ), so when we square ( m ), wait no. Wait, in the original expression, ( n = p times m^2 ), where ( m = p - 3 ). Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is ( p times (p - 3)^2 ). So ( m = p - 3 ), so ( m^2 ) is part of the expression, not ( m ). Therefore, if ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 ), then ( m^2 = q_1^2 times q_2^4 ), so the entire expression ( n = p times m^2 = p times q_1^2 times q_2^4 ). Then, the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 2 times 3 times 5 = 30 ). So, this would give 30 divisors. Therefore, if ( m^2 ) has the prime factors ( q_1^2 times q_2^4 ), then ( n = p times q_1^2 times q_2^4 ), and the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 30 ).But in the case where ( p = 11 ), ( m = 8 ), which factors as ( 2^3 ), so ( m^2 = (2^3)^2 = 2^6 ), so ( n = 11 times 2^6 ). Therefore, the exponents are 1 (for 11) and 6 (for 2). Therefore, the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(6 + 1) = 2 times 7 = 14 ), which does not equal 30. Therefore, my mistake was assuming that if ( m ) has two prime factors, then ( m^2 ) would lead to exponents 2 and 4. But in reality, the structure depends on the prime factors of ( m ).Wait, so if ( m ) is ( q_1 times q_2^2 ), then ( m^2 = q_1^2 times q_2^4 ), so when multiplied by ( p ), which is a new prime, then the exponents would be 1 for ( p ), 2 for ( q_1 ), and 4 for ( q_2 ). Therefore, the number of divisors would be ( (1 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 2 times 3 times 5 = 30 ). Therefore, in this case, the prime factors of ( m ) need to be ( q_1 times q_2^2 ).But in the case of ( p = 11 ), ( m = 8 = 2^3 ), which is ( q^3 ), so when squared, it's ( q^6 ), so the exponent of 2 becomes 6, leading to ( (1 + 1)(6 + 1) = 14 ). Therefore, the previous case where ( m ) is a single prime power doesn't give us enough divisors. Therefore, in order for the number of divisors to be 30, ( m ) must have at least two distinct prime factors such that when squared, the exponents lead to the required divisor count.Therefore, the correct approach is that ( m ) must have a prime factorization such that when squared, the exponents contribute to the divisor count.Given that ( n = p times m^2 ), and we need the number of divisors of ( n ) to be 30. The number of divisors is ( (e_p + 1) times prod_{i=1}^{k} (e_{q_i} + 1) ), where ( e_p = 1 ) (since ( p ) is a single prime factor), and ( e_{q_i} ) are the exponents of the prime factors in ( m^2 ).Since ( m^2 = (q_1^{a} q_2^{b} dots q_k^{c})^2 = q_1^{2a} q_2^{2b} dots q_k^{2c} ), the exponents in ( n ) are 1 (from ( p )), and ( 2a, 2b, dots, 2c ). Therefore, the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(2a + 1)(2b + 1) dots (2c + 1) = 2 times prod (2a_i + 1) ). We need this product to be 30, so ( prod (2a_i + 1) = 15 ).Therefore, as earlier, 15 can be factored as 15, 5 × 3, or 3 × 5. So possible factorizations of 15 into integers greater than 1 (since ( a_i geq 1 implies 2a_i + 1 geq 3 )):1. Single factor: 15. Then, ( 2a + 1 = 15 implies a = 7 ). So ( m ) is a single prime raised to the 7th power. Then ( m = q^7 implies p = q^7 + 3 ). The smallest prime ( q ) here is 2, leading to ( p = 2^7 + 3 = 128 + 3 = 131 ). Then check if 131 is prime (yes). Then ( n = 131 × (131 - 3)^2 = 131 × 128^2 ). The number of divisors would be ( (1 + 1)(7 × 2 + 1) ). Wait, wait, actually, ( m = 128 = 2^7 ), so ( m^2 = 2^{14} ). Therefore, ( n = 131 × 2^{14} ), so the number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(14 + 1) = 2 × 15 = 30 ). So this works, but ( p = 131 ).2. Two factors: 5 × 3. Then, ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 5 × 3 implies a = 2, b = 1 ). Therefore, ( m ) has two distinct prime factors with exponents 2 and 1. So ( m = q_1^2 q_2 ). Therefore, ( m^2 = q_1^4 q_2^2 ). Then, ( n = p × q_1^4 q_2^2 ). The number of divisors is ( (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 × 5 × 3 = 30 ). Therefore, ( m = q_1^2 q_2 ), so ( p = m + 3 = q_1^2 q_2 + 3 ). We need ( p ) to be prime.To find the smallest such ( p ), we need the smallest primes ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ). Let's try combinations starting with the smallest primes.First, let ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 2 ): Then, ( m = 2^2 × 2 = 8 ), same as before. Then ( p = 8 + 3 = 11 ). But as before, ( m = 8 = 2^3 ), so ( m^2 = 2^6 ), leading to ( n = 11 × 2^6 ), which gives 14 divisors. But wait, in this case, if we consider ( m = 2^2 × 2 ), that's not two distinct primes. Therefore, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) need to be distinct primes for this case. Wait, does the problem specify that the prime factors need to be distinct?Wait, in the factorization, ( m = q_1^2 q_2 ), if ( q_1 = q_2 ), then ( m = q_1^3 ), which would have a single prime factor. But in our case, we need two distinct prime factors. So, in order for ( m ) to have two distinct prime factors, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) must be distinct.Therefore, let's try ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 3 ): Then, ( m = 2^2 × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12 ). Then, ( p = 12 + 3 = 15 ), which is not prime.Next, ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 5 ): ( m = 4 × 5 = 20 ), ( p = 23 ). Check if 23 is prime (yes). Now, compute ( n = 23 × (20)^2 = 23 × 400 = 9200 ). Let's factorize 9200: 9200 = 23 × 400 = 23 × 2^4 × 5^2. Therefore, prime factors are 2^4, 5^2, and 23^1. The number of divisors is (4 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 × 3 × 2 = 30. Perfect! So this works. Therefore, ( p = 23 ) is a solution.Wait, let's check if there's a smaller prime ( p ).Trying ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 7 ): ( m = 4 × 7 = 28 ), ( p = 31 ), which is prime. Then, ( n = 31 × 28^2 = 31 × 784 = let's see, factorize 28: 2^2 × 7, so 28^2 = 2^4 × 7^2. Therefore, ( n = 31 × 2^4 × 7^2 ), so number of divisors is (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 × 5 × 3 = 30. So 31 is also a solution, but 23 is smaller.Is there a smaller prime than 23? Let's check other combinations.Next, ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 2 ): same as ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 3 ), which gave ( p = 15 ), not prime.( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 5 ): ( m = 9 × 5 = 45 ), ( p = 48 ), not prime.( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 3 ): already tried, gives ( p = 15 ).What about ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 2 ): but they must be distinct, so that's not allowed. If they are the same, it becomes ( q_1^3 ), which is a single prime factor. So that case is different.Alternatively, trying ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 7 ): gave p = 31.Wait, perhaps another combination. What if ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 2 ): ( m = 3^2 × 2 = 9 × 2 = 18 ), then ( p = 21 ), which is not prime.( q_1 = 5 ), ( q_2 = 2 ): ( m = 25 × 2 = 50 ), ( p = 53 ), which is prime. Then, ( n = 53 × 50^2 = 53 × 2500 ). Factorizing 50^2: 2^2 × 5^4. Therefore, ( n = 53 × 2^2 × 5^4 ). Number of divisors: (1 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 2 × 3 × 5 = 30. So 53 is another solution, but larger than 23.So far, the smallest solution in this case is 23.Wait, let's check ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 5 ) gives ( p = 23 ). Let's confirm:( m = 2^2 × 5 = 4 × 5 = 20 ), so ( p = 20 + 3 = 23 ). Prime factorization of ( m = 20 = 2^2 × 5^1 ). Therefore, ( m^2 = (2^2 × 5)^2 = 2^4 × 5^2 ). Therefore, ( n = 23 × 2^4 × 5^2 ). The exponents are 1, 4, and 2 for primes 23, 2, and 5 respectively. Therefore, the number of divisors is (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 × 5 × 3 = 30. Correct.Is there a smaller prime ( p ) in this case? Let's check ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 3 ): ( p = 15 ), not prime. ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 5 ): ( p = 23 ). Next, ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 7 ): ( p = 31 ). So 23 is the smallest here.But earlier, when I tried ( q_1 = 2 ), ( q_2 = 2 ), which would make ( m = 8 ), leading to ( p = 11 ), but that case had only one prime factor, leading to 14 divisors. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, what if ( m ) has three distinct prime factors? Let's see. For example, if ( m ) has three distinct primes such that ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1)(2c + 1) = 15 ). But 15 factors into three numbers greater than 1 only as 3 × 5 × 1, but 1 is not allowed because exponents must be at least 1 (since ( m ) is composite). Therefore, that's impossible. Therefore, only two cases: single factor 15 or two factors 3 × 5.Therefore, the possible primes are 23 and 131. Since 23 is smaller, so 23 is the answer.Wait, but before concluding, let me check if there's a prime ( p ) less than 23 that could satisfy the condition. Let's check primes less than 23.Primes less than 23: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.We already checked p=5: n=20 has 6 divisors.p=7: compute ( n = 7*(7-3)^2 = 7*16 = 112 ). Factorize 112: 2^4 * 7^1. Number of divisors: (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5*2=10. Not 30.p=11: n=11*8^2=11*64=704=2^6*11. Divisors: (6+1)(1+1)=7*2=14. Not 30.p=13: n=13*(10)^2=13*100=1300=2^2*5^2*13. Divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18. Not 30.p=17: n=17*(14)^2=17*196=3332. Factorize 14^2=196=2^2*7^2. So 3332=2^2*7^2*17. Divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18. Not 30.p=19: n=19*(16)^2=19*256=4864. 16 is 2^4, so 16^2=2^8. Hence, n=2^8*19. Divisors: (8+1)(1+1)=9*2=18. Not 30.So none of the primes less than 23 work. Therefore, 23 is indeed the smallest prime where ( p(p - 3)^2 ) has exactly 30 divisors.But let me verify once again for ( p = 23 ):( n = 23*(20)^2 = 23*400 = 9200 ).Factorization of 20: 2^2 * 5, so 20^2 = (2^2 * 5)^2 = 2^4 * 5^2. Therefore, n = 23 * 2^4 * 5^2.Number of divisors: (1 (from 23) +1)*(4 (from 2^4) +1)*(2 (from 5^2) +1) = 2*5*3=30. Perfect.Therefore, the smallest prime ( p ) is 23.But hold on, wait. Let me check if there are any other combinations for ( m = p - 3 ) with different exponents. For example, if ( m ) is a product of three primes, but as we saw earlier, the product ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1)(2c + 1) = 15 ) would require one of the exponents to be 0, which is not allowed since ( m ) is composite. So that case is invalid.Alternatively, if ( m ) has a prime factor raised to the 7th power, leading to ( p = 131 ), but that's larger than 23. So 23 is indeed the smallest.Therefore, after thorough checking and factorization, the smallest prime ( p ) is 23.Final AnswerThe smallest value of ( p ) is boxed{23}.</think>Given a prime number ( p ) such that ( p^3 - 6p^2 + 9p ) has exactly 30 positive divisors, we need to find the smallest such ( p ).First, we factor the expression:[p^3 - 6p^2 + 9p = p(p - 3)^2]We need the number of divisors of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) to be 30. The number of divisors of a number ( n = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} cdots q_k^{a_k} ) is given by ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) cdots (a_k + 1) ).For ( p(p - 3)^2 ), we consider the prime factorization. Let ( m = p - 3 ). Then, ( p(p - 3)^2 = p cdot m^2 ). We need the number of divisors of this product to be 30.The number of divisors is calculated as:[(1 + 1) times text{(product of } (2a_i + 1) text{ for each prime factor } q_i text{ of } m)]This product must equal 30. Therefore:[2 times prod (2a_i + 1) = 30 implies prod (2a_i + 1) = 15]The factorization of 15 can be ( 15 ) or ( 3 times 5 ). We need to check both cases:1. Case 1: Single factor 15     ( 2a + 1 = 15 implies a = 7 ). Then ( m = q^7 ). The smallest prime ( q = 2 ) gives ( m = 128 ) and ( p = 128 + 3 = 131 ). This is valid but not the smallest.2. Case 2: Factors 3 and 5     ( (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 3 times 5 implies a = 1, b = 2 ). Then ( m = q_1 times q_2^2 ). The smallest primes ( q_1 = 2 ) and ( q_2 = 5 ) give ( m = 2^2 times 5 = 20 ). Then ( p = 20 + 3 = 23 ).Checking ( p = 23 ):- ( p = 23 ) is prime.- ( m = 20 = 2^2 times 5 )- ( m^2 = (2^2 times 5)^2 = 2^4 times 5^2 )- The number of divisors of ( 23 times 2^4 times 5^2 ) is ( (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 times 5 times 3 = 30 ).Thus, the smallest prime ( p ) is (boxed{23}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p such that the expression p³ - 6p² + 9p has exactly 30 positive divisors. Hmm, let's start by simplifying the given expression. Maybe factoring it will help me analyze the number of divisors.First, let's look at the expression: p³ - 6p² + 9p. I can factor out a p from all the terms:p(p² - 6p + 9).Now, the quadratic expression inside the parentheses is p² - 6p + 9. Let me check if that factors further. The quadratic formula gives roots at [6 ± sqrt(36 - 36)] / 2 = [6 ± 0]/2 = 3. So, this is a perfect square: (p - 3)². Therefore, the original expression factors as:p(p - 3)².So the expression simplifies to p multiplied by (p - 3) squared. Since p is a prime number, and (p - 3) is another number, which may or may not be prime depending on p. But to find the number of divisors, I need to express the entire expression as a product of primes raised to exponents, then apply the formula for the number of divisors.The formula for the number of positive divisors of a number n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k is (a₁ + 1)(a₂ + 1)...(a_k + 1). So, we need to find the prime factorization of p(p - 3)² and then compute the product of one more than each exponent.But since p is prime, and (p - 3) could be either another prime or composite, I need to consider different cases. Let's note that p and (p - 3) might be coprime or not. Since p is prime, the only common divisor between p and (p - 3) would be a divisor of p and (p - 3). If p divides (p - 3), then p divides 3. So the only possible common divisor is 3. Thus, if p ≠ 3, then p and (p - 3) are coprime. If p = 3, then (p - 3) is 0, but since p is a prime, p=3 would make the expression 3*0² = 0, which has infinitely many divisors? Wait, but the problem states \\"positive divisors\\", and 0 is not a positive integer. So p=3 is invalid because the expression becomes 0, which isn't considered here. Therefore, p cannot be 3. Thus, for primes p ≠ 3, p and (p - 3) are coprime because their GCD is 1. So p and (p - 3) are coprime. Therefore, the prime factors of the expression p(p - 3)² are p and the prime factors of (p - 3). Therefore, the number of positive divisors of the expression is (1 + 1) * (2 + 1) * ... where the exponents are from the prime factorization of p and (p - 3)². Wait, but since (p - 3) could be composite, we need to factor it into primes. Let me formalize this:Let’s denote the expression as N = p * (p - 3)^2. Since p is prime, and p and (p - 3) are coprime (as established earlier), then the prime factors of N are p and the prime factors of (p - 3). Therefore, the number of divisors of N is (1 + 1) multiplied by the product of (each exponent in the prime factorization of (p - 3)^2 plus 1). Wait, more precisely: Let’s factor (p - 3) into its prime factors. Suppose (p - 3) factors as q₁^a * q₂^b * ... * q_k^c, then (p - 3)^2 would be q₁^(2a) * q₂^(2b) * ... * q_k^(2c). Therefore, the entire expression N = p * q₁^(2a) * q₂^(2b) * ... * q_k^(2c). Since p is a different prime (because p and (p - 3) are coprime), the number of divisors of N is (1 + 1) * (2a + 1) * (2b + 1) * ... * (2c + 1). Therefore, the total number of divisors is 2 multiplied by the product of (2 times each exponent in the prime factorization of (p - 3) plus 1). Given that the total number of divisors is 30, we have:2 * (2a + 1)(2b + 1)...(2c + 1) = 30.Therefore, (2a + 1)(2b + 1)...(2c + 1) = 15.So, now, we need to find primes p such that when we factor (p - 3) into primes, the product of (2 times each exponent plus 1) equals 15. Also, we need to find the smallest such prime p.So, first, let's note that 15 can be factored as 15 = 15, 5 * 3, or 3 * 5. Since the order doesn't matter, but the exponents in the prime factorization are ordered from highest to lowest, but since we are dealing with primes, the exponents could be arranged in any order. However, since each (2a +1) must be an odd integer greater than 1 (since exponents are at least 1 in the prime factors of (p - 3), but wait, hold on: (p - 3) could be 1? Wait, if p - 3 = 1, then p = 4, which is not prime. The next prime is p=5: 5 -3 = 2, which is prime. Wait, so if (p - 3) is 1, p=4, which is not prime. So p must be at least 5. Then (p -3) is at least 2. So (p -3) is at least 2, and can be prime or composite. So the prime factors of (p -3) are primes greater than or equal to 2.But let's get back. Since (p -3) is at least 2, the prime factors of (p -3) will have exponents at least 1. However, if (p -3) is a prime, then its factorization is itself with exponent 1, so (2*1 +1) = 3. If (p -3) is a square of a prime, then exponent is 2, so (2*2 +1)=5. If (p -3) is a product of two distinct primes, each with exponent 1, then the product would be (2*1 +1)(2*1 +1)=3*3=9. If (p -3) is a cube of a prime, exponent 3, so (2*3 +1)=7. But 7 is a factor of 15? 15 factors are 1,3,5,15. Wait, so 15 can be written as 15, 5*3, 3*5. Since 15 is the product, and each term is (2a_i +1), which must be odd numbers greater than or equal to 3. So possible options for the product (2a +1)(2b +1)...=15 are:1. 15 itself: so one factor of 15, which would correspond to (2a +1)=15, so a=7. So this would mean that (p -3) is a prime raised to the 7th power. But primes raised to the 7th power are large numbers. Let's check if p -3 is a prime to the 7th power. For small primes, like 2^7=128, so p=128 +3=131. Is 131 prime? Yes, 131 is a prime. But that might be a candidate, but maybe there's a smaller p.2. 5*3: two factors, so two primes in the factorization of (p -3). Each factor is 5 and 3, which correspond to exponents a and b such that (2a +1)=5 => a=2, and (2b +1)=3 => b=1. Therefore, (p -3) would be a product of a prime squared and another prime to the first power. So (p -3) = q^2 * r, where q and r are distinct primes.3. 3*5: same as above, just swapping the exponents. So (p -3)=q^1 * r^2, but since multiplication is commutative, this is essentially the same case as above.So the possible cases are either (p -3) is a single prime raised to the 7th power, or (p -3) is the product of two primes, one squared and the other to the first power. Since we are to find the smallest prime p, we should check which case gives the smaller p.First, let's check the second case: (p -3) = q^2 * r, with q and r distinct primes. Then p = 3 + q²r. Since we need the smallest p, we need to choose the smallest possible primes q and r such that 3 + q²r is prime.Similarly, the first case: (p -3) = s^7, so p = 3 + s^7. The smallest prime s is 2, so p = 3 + 128 = 131, which is prime, as mentioned. But 131 is quite a large prime. Let's see if the other case gives a smaller p.For the second case, let's try combinations of small primes q and r. Since q and r are distinct primes, let's start with the smallest possible q and r.First, let q=2 (smallest prime), then r=3 (next smallest prime). Then p = 3 + (2²)*3 = 3 + 4*3 = 3 + 12 = 15. But 15 is not prime. Next, r=5: p=3 +4*5=23. 23 is prime. So p=23. Let's check if that works.Wait, p=23. Then (p -3)=20. Wait, 20 factors as 2² *5. So exponents are 2 and 1. Therefore, when squared in the original expression, (p -3)² = (20)² = (2² *5)^2 = 2^4 *5^2. Then N= p*(p -3)²=23*(2^4 *5^2). So the prime factors are 2,5,23 with exponents 4,2,1 respectively. The number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. Yes, that works! So p=23 gives exactly 30 positive divisors. But wait, is 23 the smallest prime for this case? Let's check other combinations.If q=2 and r=3: p=15, not prime.q=2, r=5: p=23, prime.q=2, r=7: p=3 +4*7=31, which is prime. But 31 is bigger than 23.q=3, r=2: then p=3 +9*2=21, which is not prime.q=3, r=5: p=3 +9*5=48, not prime.q=5, r=2: p=3 +25*2=53, prime but larger.Alternatively, q=2 and r=2: but they have to be distinct primes, so r can't be 2 if q=2. So the next possible is r=3, which gives p=15, not prime. So the next is r=5, which gives p=23. Alternatively, perhaps if (p -3) is a cube of a prime times another prime? Wait, no. Wait, the requirement is that the product (2a +1)(2b +1)...=15. Since 15=3*5, then we need two factors, 3 and 5. Therefore, exponents a and b must satisfy (2a +1)=3 and (2b +1)=5, so a=1 and b=2. Therefore, (p -3) would be a product of a prime to the first power and another prime to the second power. Which is the same as q²*r. So same as above.Alternatively, could (p -3) have three prime factors? For example, 15=3*5, but if we have three factors, they would have to be 3*5*1, but 1 is not allowed because exponents can't be zero (since p -3 is at least 2). Therefore, the only possible factorizations of 15 are 15 or 3*5, corresponding to one prime factor with exponent 7 or two prime factors with exponents 1 and 2.Therefore, the minimal p would be the minimal between 131 (from the first case) and 23 (from the second case). Since 23 is smaller, we check p=23. But before finalizing, let's check if there's another combination where (p -3) is a product of two primes squared and another prime, but no, that would require more factors. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the factorization is either one prime raised to the 7th power or two primes with exponents 2 and 1. So 23 is a candidate. Let me verify again.If p=23, then N=23*(23 -3)^2=23*(20)^2=23*400=9200. Let's factor 9200. 9200 divided by 100 is 92, so 9200=100*92=2²*5²*2²*23. Wait, that would be 2^(2+2)*5²*23=2^4 *5² *23. So exponents 4,2,1. Number of divisors: (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. Correct. So that works.Is there a smaller prime? Let's check the next possible candidate in the second case. Let's see if there are smaller primes p such that (p -3) is q²*r. The next combination after q=2, r=5 (p=23) is q=2, r=7 (p=31), which is higher. Alternatively, q=3, r=2 (p=3 +9*2=21, not prime). So 23 is indeed the smallest in this case.But just to be thorough, let's check if any smaller primes than 23 could work. Let's check primes starting from the smallest.p=2: N=2*(2-3)^2=2*1=2. Number of divisors is 2, which is not 30.p=5: N=5*(5-3)^2=5*4=20. Prime factors: 2²*5. Number of divisors: (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6≠30.p=7: N=7*(7-3)^2=7*16=112=2^4*7. Number of divisors: (4+1)(1+1)=5*2=10≠30.p=11: N=11*(11-3)^2=11*64=704=2^6*11. Number of divisors: (6+1)(1+1)=7*2=14≠30.p=13: N=13*(13-3)^2=13*100=1300=2²*5²*13. Number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18≠30.p=17: N=17*(17-3)^2=17*196=3332=17*4*49=17*2²*7². Number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18≠30.p=19: N=19*(19-3)^2=19*256=4864=19*2^8. Number of divisors: (8+1)(1+1)=9*2=18≠30.p=23: As before, gives 30 divisors.So, indeed, p=23 is the first prime where the number of divisors reaches 30. Let's also check p=131 from the first case. If p=131, then (p -3)=128=2^7. Therefore, N=131*(2^7)^2=131*2^14. The number of divisors is (14+1)(1+1)=15*2=30. So that also works. But since 23 is smaller, 23 is the answer.Wait, but before concluding, let me check if there are other primes between 23 and 131 that might satisfy the condition. Let's check p= next primes after 23.p=29: N=29*(29-3)^2=29*(26)^2=29*(2*13)^2=29*2²*13². Number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18≠30.p=31: N=31*(28)^2=31*(2²*7)^2=31*2^4*7². Divisors: (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. Wait, hold on, p=31 also gives 30 divisors? Wait, let's compute it again.If p=31, then (p -3)=28=4*7=2²*7. Then N=31*(2²*7)^2=31*2^4*7². Therefore, the prime factors are 2^4, 7², 31^1. The number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. So, p=31 also satisfies the condition. But since we are looking for the smallest prime, 23 is smaller than 31. So 23 is still the answer. But wait, let's check p=23 and p=31. Both satisfy the condition. So p=23 is the smallest. Let me verify another prime in between.p=23, 29, 31. We saw p=29 doesn't work. How about p=37?p=37: N=37*(34)^2=37*(2*17)^2=37*2²*17². Number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3*3*2=18≠30.p=43: N=43*(40)^2=43*(2^3*5)^2=43*2^6*5². Number of divisors: (6+1)(2+1)(1+1)=7*3*2=42≠30.p=11: Already checked, didn't work.Wait, so p=23 and p=31 both work, but p=23 is smaller. Therefore, the answer is 23.But let's confirm once again for p=23. Let's factor N=23*(20)^2. 20 squared is 400. 400 factors into 2^4 *5^2. Multiply by 23, which is prime. So N=2^4 *5^2 *23^1. The exponents are 4, 2, 1. The number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. Correct. So 30 divisors.Therefore, the smallest prime p is 23. So I think that's the answer.Final AnswerThe smallest value of ( p ) is boxed{23}.</think>Given a prime number ( p ) such that ( p^3 - 6p^2 + 9p ) has exactly 30 positive divisors, we start by factoring the expression:[p^3 - 6p^2 + 9p = p(p - 3)^2]We need to find the smallest prime ( p ) such that the number of positive divisors of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) is 30. The number of divisors of a number ( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} ) is given by ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) cdots (a_k + 1) ).For ( p(p - 3)^2 ), since ( p ) is a prime and ( p neq 3 ) (as ( p = 3 ) would make the expression zero), ( p ) and ( p - 3 ) are coprime. Therefore, the prime factorization of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) involves ( p ) and the prime factors of ( (p - 3)^2 ).Let ( (p - 3) = q_1^{a} q_2^{b} cdots q_k^{c} ). Then ( (p - 3)^2 = q_1^{2a} q_2^{2b} cdots q_k^{2c} ), and the number of divisors of ( p(p - 3)^2 ) is:[(1 + 1)(2a + 1)(2b + 1) cdots (2c + 1) = 30]This simplifies to:[2 cdot (2a + 1)(2b + 1) cdots (2c + 1) = 30 implies (2a + 1)(2b + 1) cdots (2c + 1) = 15]The factorization of 15 can be ( 15 ) or ( 3 times 5 ). We need to check the smallest primes ( p ) such that ( (p - 3) ) results in these factorizations.For the factorization ( 3 times 5 ), we need ( (p - 3) ) to be a product of a prime squared and another prime. Trying small primes, we find:- If ( p = 23 ), then ( p - 3 = 20 = 2^2 times 5 ). The number of divisors is ( (4 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 times 3 times 2 = 30 ).Checking smaller primes, we find that none satisfy the condition. For example, ( p = 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 ) do not result in 30 divisors. Thus, the smallest prime ( p ) is (boxed{23}).]"},{"problem":"1A.

I need to find all natural numbers n such that z = ((3 + i)/(2 - i))^n is a real number. Hmm. Alright, so first step, maybe simplify the complex fraction (3 + i)/(2 - i) into a standard form a + bi. Then, since complex numbers can be represented in polar form, maybe convert that to polar form so it's easier to raise to the nth power. Once it's in polar form, raising it to the nth power would just involve raising the modulus to the nth power and multiplying the argument by n. Then, for the result to be real, the argument times n must be a multiple of pi, right? Because a complex number is real if its angle is 0 or pi or any multiple of pi. So, that's probably the key idea here.Let me start by simplifying (3 + i)/(2 - i). To do that, I should multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 2 - i is 2 + i. So:(3 + i)/(2 - i) * (2 + i)/(2 + i) = [(3 + i)(2 + i)] / [(2 - i)(2 + i)]First compute the denominator: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2*2 + 2*i - i*2 - i*i = 4 + 2i - 2i - i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 4 - (-1) = 5. So denominator is 5.Now numerator: (3 + i)(2 + i) = 3*2 + 3*i + i*2 + i*i = 6 + 3i + 2i + i². That's 6 + 5i + (-1) = 5 + 5i. So the numerator is 5 + 5i.Therefore, (3 + i)/(2 - i) simplifies to (5 + 5i)/5 = 1 + i. Wait, really? That's surprising. Let me check that again.Wait, the denominator is (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5. Correct. Then numerator: (3 + i)(2 + i) = 3*2 + 3*i + i*2 + i*i = 6 + 3i + 2i + (-1) = 6 + 5i -1 = 5 + 5i. So numerator is 5 + 5i. Divide by 5: (5 + 5i)/5 = 1 + i. So yes, (3 + i)/(2 - i) simplifies to 1 + i. Interesting. So z = (1 + i)^n. So we need to find all natural numbers n such that (1 + i)^n is real.Alright, so now the problem reduces to finding n where (1 + i)^n is real. Let's recall that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = pi/4. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(pi/4) + i sin(pi/4)).Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * (cos(n pi/4) + i sin(n pi/4)). For this to be real, the imaginary part must be zero. So sin(n pi/4) = 0. So n pi/4 must be an integer multiple of pi. That is, n pi/4 = k pi, where k is an integer. So n/4 = k, so n = 4k. Since n is a natural number, k must be a positive integer. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 4. So n = 4, 8, 12, 16, etc.Wait, but let me check for n = 0. Wait, n is a natural number. Depending on the definition, natural numbers sometimes start at 1. If n=0 is allowed, then (1 + i)^0 = 1, which is real. But since the problem says natural numbers, and depending on the context, sometimes natural numbers start at 1. But in some definitions, they start at 0. Hmm. But in the problem statement, since it's asking for natural numbers, and in mathematics, natural numbers usually refer to positive integers (1,2,3,...). So n=0 is probably excluded. So the answer would be all positive integers divisible by 4.But let me verify with specific examples. Let's compute (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i, which is not real. (1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i, which is purely imaginary, not real. (1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)^2*(1 + i) = (2i)(1 + i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i, still not real. (1 + i)^4 = (1 + i)^2 squared = (2i)^2 = -4, which is real. So n=4 is a solution. Then n=5 would be (1 + i)^4*(1 + i) = -4*(1 + i) = -4 -4i, which is not real. n=8: (1 + i)^8 = ((1 + i)^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16, which is real. Similarly, n=12 would be ((1 + i)^4)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64, real. So every multiple of 4 gives a real number. So the answer is all natural numbers n divisible by 4, i.e., n = 4k where k is a natural number.Therefore, the solution is all natural numbers n congruent to 0 modulo 4, so n ≡ 0 (mod 4). So the answer is all n in N such that n is a multiple of 4.But let me confirm once more. The angle of 1 + i is pi/4, so when multiplied by n, we get n pi/4. For the result to be real, the angle must be a multiple of pi. So n pi/4 = k pi => n/4 = k => n = 4k, k integer. Since n is a natural number, k must be positive integers, so n = 4, 8, 12, etc. Hence, the natural numbers n divisible by 4.Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers n where n is a multiple of 4.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( n ) are all multiples of 4. Thus, the solution is (boxed{4k}) where ( k ) is a natural number. However, following the required format, the answer should be presented as specific numbers. Since the problem asks for all such natural numbers, the answer is every positive integer divisible by 4. Therefore, the boxed answer is:boxed{4mathbb{N}}But if the problem expects a specific form, maybe listing the general term. Alternatively, in some contexts, using boxed{4k} with (k in mathbb{N}). However, standard practice for such problems is to present the answer as all multiples of 4, which can be represented as boxed{4k} where (k) is a positive integer. But since the question says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", and given the standard way to present such answers, probably boxed{4k} where (k) is a natural number. But in some textbooks, they might list the set as {4, 8, 12, ...}. But in the format required here, using boxed notation, perhaps the answer is expressed as n = 4k for natural numbers k, so boxed{4k}.Wait, but maybe the question expects to list all n in boxed notation. However, the problem says \\"determine all natural numbers n\\", so likely the answer is all multiples of 4. Since in Olympiad problems, they sometimes expect the answer as boxed{4} if only one solution, but here it's infinitely many. However, since it's impossible to list all in a box, the standard is to present the form. But in the initial problem statement, maybe 4mathbb{N} is acceptable. But perhaps the user expects boxed{4k} where k is a natural number, but within a single box. Alternatively, check instructions: the user says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\". Hmm. Maybe in the form n = 4k, but in Chinese problems, sometimes they use boxed{4} if the modulus is 4, but here it's different. Wait, perhaps since the original complex number when raised to n is real when n is multiple of 4, so the answer is n ≡ 0 mod 4, so boxed as 4k.But in some contexts, they might write boxed{4} indicating period 4, but no. Wait, perhaps the answer is n is divisible by 4, so boxed as boxed{4k} for some k ∈ N.But in the initial example, they might have wanted all n in N where n is divisible by 4, so expressing as boxed{4k} where k is a natural number. Alternatively, since the user might expect the answer in the box as boxed{4} if only 4 works, but in this case, all multiples of 4. However, in the problem's original version, maybe in Chinese or another language, sometimes they present the general solution in the box. But given the ambiguity, but since the user instruction says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", and in previous examples, when there are multiple solutions, like all multiples of something, they use boxed with 4k. Alternatively, if it's required to denote as a set, but since the user hasn't specified, and in most cases, such answers are represented as n = 4k, so boxed as boxed{4k}.But in some resources, they might write boxed{4} if the modulus is 4, but that would be incorrect here. Alternatively, since when the angle is pi/4, then n must make n * pi/4 = k pi, so n = 4k, so the answer is 4k. So the answer is n = 4k for natural numbers k. So boxed as boxed{4k}.Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer as n ≡ 0 mod 4, boxed as boxed{4mathbb{N}}.But I need to check the initial problem's standard answer. Let me recall, when you raise (1+i) to the n, it's real when n is a multiple of 4. So the answer is all n such that n is divisible by 4. So in boxed form, since we can't list all, we write as boxed{4k} where (k) is a natural number. However, in the format required here, perhaps simply boxed{4k}, assuming that k is understood to be a natural number. Alternatively, if the system requires a specific answer, but given the instructions, I think boxed{4k} is appropriate.Wait, but maybe the problem expects the minimal n, but no, the question says \\"all natural numbers n\\". So since it's infinitely many, we need to express in terms of k. Therefore, the answer is boxed{4k} where k is a natural number. But how to represent this in a single box. Maybe like boxed{4mathbb{N}} where mathbb{N} represents natural numbers. But if the system does not support LaTeX mathbb, maybe boldface N, but in standard LaTeX, yes. So since in the problem statement, the example uses boxed{}, and they might have used boxed{4k} for similar problems. Therefore, I will put boxed{4k} as the final answer, indicating that k is a natural number.But wait, let me check once again. The original complex number simplifies to 1 + i. Then, (1 + i)^n is real when n is a multiple of 4. Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers n divisible by 4, so n = 4, 8, 12, etc. So in terms of a boxed answer, the standard way is to present the general form. Hence, the final answer is boxed{4k} where k is a natural number. However, the user might require just stating the modulus, but no. Alternatively, since in the problem statement, they asked \\"determine all natural numbers n\\", so the answer is n = 4k for k ∈ N, which in boxed form is boxed{4k}.Yes, I think that's the correct way.Final Answerboxed{4k} where ( k ) is a natural number.But according to the instructions, they might want the answer in the box without any extra text. But since 4k is parameterizing all solutions, and in some contexts, they just write boxed{4} if the answer is modulo 4, but here it's different. Alternatively, the assistant might have to write boxed{4} but that's incorrect because n=4,8,12,... are all solutions. However, the user might want the answer as n=4k, but written in boxed form. In many mathematical problems, when the solution is an arithmetic progression, they write the general term in the box. For example, if solutions are all even numbers, they write boxed{2k}. So following that convention, the answer is boxed{4k}. But to adhere strictly, since the user might expect the answer as n = 4k, but within a single box, maybe using boxed{4mathbb{N}} if that's acceptable. However, in standard practice, especially in Olympiads, if the answer is all multiples of 4, they write boxed{4} as the period, but I think that's not correct here. Because the question is not asking for the period, but all n. Hence, to present all solutions, we need to express the general form. Given that the user's instructions are to put the final answer within boxed{}, perhaps boxed{4k} is the most appropriate, as it indicates the form of all solutions.Final Answerboxed{4k}</think>To determine all natural numbers ( n ) for which the number ( z = left( frac{3 + i}{2 - i} right)^n ) is real, we start by simplifying the complex fraction ( frac{3 + i}{2 - i} ).First, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:[frac{3 + i}{2 - i} cdot frac{2 + i}{2 + i} = frac{(3 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)}]Calculating the denominator:[(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5]Calculating the numerator:[(3 + i)(2 + i) = 6 + 3i + 2i + i^2 = 6 + 5i - 1 = 5 + 5i]Thus, the simplified form is:[frac{5 + 5i}{5} = 1 + i]Next, we need to find ( n ) such that ( (1 + i)^n ) is real. Converting ( 1 + i ) to polar form, we have:[1 + i = sqrt{2} left( cos frac{pi}{4} + i sin frac{pi}{4} right)]Raising this to the power ( n ):[(1 + i)^n = (sqrt{2})^n left( cos frac{npi}{4} + i sin frac{npi}{4} right)]For the result to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, so:[sin frac{npi}{4} = 0]This occurs when ( frac{npi}{4} ) is an integer multiple of ( pi ):[frac{npi}{4} = kpi quad text{for some integer } k implies frac{n}{4} = k implies n = 4k]Since ( n ) is a natural number, ( k ) must also be a natural number. Therefore, all natural numbers ( n ) that are multiples of 4 satisfy the condition.[boxed{4k}],<think>Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all natural numbers n such that the complex number z = ((3 + i)/(2 - i))^n is real. Hmm, let's start by recalling that a complex number raised to a power will be real if the result lies on the real axis in the complex plane. That usually means that the angle (argument) of the original complex number, when multiplied by n, becomes a multiple of π (180 degrees), right? Because rotating by multiples of π radians will land you on the real axis.So first, maybe I need to simplify the expression (3 + i)/(2 - i). To do that, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator. The conjugate of (2 - i) is (2 + i). Let's try that.Multiplying numerator: (3 + i)(2 + i)Let me compute that:3*2 = 63*i = 3ii*2 = 2ii*i = i² = -1So adding them up: 6 + 3i + 2i -1 = (6 -1) + (3i + 2i) = 5 + 5iDenominator: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2*2 + 2*i - i*2 - i*i = 4 + 2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5So after simplifying, (3 + i)/(2 - i) becomes (5 + 5i)/5 = 1 + i. Oh, that's simpler! So z is (1 + i)^n. Now, I need to find all natural numbers n such that (1 + i)^n is real.Alright, next step. Let me recall that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2). The argument (angle) is arctangent(1/1) = 45 degrees or π/4 radians. So in polar form, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)).Therefore, raising it to the power n gives (sqrt(2))^n * (cos(nπ/4) + i sin(nπ/4)). For this to be real, the imaginary part has to be zero. So sin(nπ/4) must equal zero. When does sin(θ) = 0? When θ is an integer multiple of π, that is, θ = kπ for some integer k.So set nπ/4 = kπ => n/4 = k => n = 4k. Since n is a natural number (assuming natural numbers start at 1), k must be a positive integer. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 4. So n = 4, 8, 12, etc.Wait, but let me check for a few values of n to make sure.Take n=1: (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i, which is not real.n=2: (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i² = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i, which is purely imaginary, not real.n=3: (1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)*(1 + 2i + i²) = (1 + i)*(2i) = 2i + 2i² = 2i -2 = -2 + 2i, still not real.n=4: (1 + i)^4 = ((1 + i)^2)^2 = (2i)^2 = -4, which is real.n=5: (1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = (-4)(1 + i) = -4 -4i, which is not real.n=6: (1 + i)^6 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^2 = (-4)(2i) = -8i, purely imaginary.n=7: (1 + i)^7 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^3 = (-4)(-2 + 2i) = 8 -8i, not real.n=8: (1 + i)^8 = ((1 + i)^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16, which is real.So the pattern seems like every multiple of 4, starting at 4. So n must be divisible by 4. Therefore, all natural numbers n that are multiples of 4.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the angle calculation. The original angle was π/4, right? So when multiplied by n, the angle becomes nπ/4. For the result to be real, the angle must be congruent to 0 or π modulo 2π. So nπ/4 ≡ 0 mod π. That is, nπ/4 = kπ for some integer k, so n/4 = k => n = 4k. But wait, 0 mod π would mean that the angle is a multiple of π, either 0, π, 2π, etc. So for example, angles 0, π, 2π, 3π, etc., which correspond to points on the real axis. So yes, nπ/4 must be an integer multiple of π. Hence, n must be a multiple of 4.Alternatively, if I consider the argument, arg(z^n) = n * arg(z) = n * π/4. For z^n to be real, arg(z^n) must be congruent to 0 or π modulo 2π. Therefore:n * π/4 ≡ 0 mod πWhich implies that n * (1/4) ≡ 0 mod 1 (since dividing both sides by π). So n/4 must be an integer. Therefore, n must be a multiple of 4. Hence, all n ∈ ℕ where n is divisible by 4.Therefore, the solution is all natural numbers n such that n is a multiple of 4, i.e., n = 4k where k is a natural number.But wait, in my earlier examples, n=4 gives -4 (real), n=8 gives 16 (real), so multiples of 4 work, but what about n=0? But the problem says natural numbers. Depending on the definition, natural numbers sometimes start at 1, sometimes at 0. If n=0 is allowed, then (1 + i)^0 = 1, which is real. But since the problem says natural numbers, and usually in math problems like this, unless specified, natural numbers start at 1. So n=0 is excluded. So starting at n=4, 8, 12, etc.Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers n divisible by 4, i.e., n ≡ 0 mod 4.But just to make sure, let's check with another approach. Let's compute (1 + i)^n using binomial expansion and see when the imaginary part is zero.(1 + i)^n = Σ_{k=0}^n (n choose k) 1^{n -k} i^k = Σ_{k=0}^n (n choose k) i^kThe imaginary part is the sum over k odd, since i^k is imaginary when k is odd and real when k is even. Wait, actually, let's clarify:i^0 = 1 (real)i^1 = i (imaginary)i^2 = -1 (real)i^3 = -i (imaginary)i^4 = 1 (real), etc.So the terms alternate between real and imaginary. Therefore, when expanding (1 + i)^n, the real part is the sum over even k, and the imaginary part is the sum over odd k. For the entire number to be real, the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore, the sum over odd k of (n choose k) i^k must be zero. But i^k alternates between i and -i for odd k. For k = 1, 5, 9, ... it's i, and for k = 3, 7, 11, ... it's -i. Wait, but how does that sum work?Wait, let's write it out:Imaginary part = Σ_{m=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} (n choose 2m + 1) i^{2m +1}But i^{2m +1} = i * i^{2m} = i * (-1)^mTherefore, imaginary part = i * Σ_{m=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} (n choose 2m +1) (-1)^mFor the imaginary part to be zero, the sum Σ_{m=0}^{floor((n-1)/2)} (n choose 2m +1) (-1)^m must be zero.Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use the polar form approach, which is more straightforward. Since we already saw through polar form that n must be a multiple of 4, and verified it with examples, maybe that's the right answer.Alternatively, another way: note that (1 + i) squared is 2i, which is purely imaginary. Then, (2i)^n is real when n is even, because (2i)^n = 2^n * i^n. If n is even, i^n is either 1 or -1. So (2i)^n is real if n is even, but wait, when n=2: (2i)^1 = 2i (not real), but (2i)^2 = -4 (real). Wait, so (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * (cos(nπ/4) + i sin(nπ/4)). So if sin(nπ/4) = 0, then nπ/4 must be multiple of π. So nπ/4 = kπ => n = 4k. So again, n must be a multiple of 4. For example, n=4: sin(4π/4) = sin(π) = 0, so real. n=2: sin(2π/4) = sin(π/2) = 1, which is not zero. So indeed, only multiples of 4 work.Therefore, the answer is all natural numbers n such that n is divisible by 4. So n = 4k where k is a natural number.Final AnswerThe natural numbers ( n ) are all multiples of 4. Thus, the solution is (boxed{4k}) where ( k ) is a natural number. Alternatively, in boxed form as requested, the specific answer format would be (boxed{4mathbb{N}}), but since the problem asks for all natural numbers ( n ), the standard way is to present it as boxed{4k} where ( k in mathbb{N} ). However, typically in such problems, the answer is expected as \\"all positive integers divisible by 4\\", which can be represented as (boxed{n=4k}) for some (kinmathbb{N}). But according to the user instruction, since they want the final answer within boxed{}, the standard representation is boxed{4} every 4, but since it's all multiples, the correct representation is multiples of 4. But in math competitions, the answer is usually given as boxed{4k} where (k) is a positive integer, but the problem says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", and if they need all such n, we might need to specify all multiples of 4. But since it's a bit ambiguous, maybe using the form boxed{4k} with k a natural number. But maybe the question expects to write in the format boxed{4mathbb{N}} or list the general form.Wait, checking the problem statement again: \\"Determine all natural numbers n...\\" and \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\". So, likely, the answer should be expressed as all multiples of 4. In mathematics, this is often represented as n ≡ 0 mod 4, but in boxed form, perhaps boxed{4k} where k is a natural number. However, in some contexts, they might expect the answer as boxed{n=4k} for some k ∈ ℕ, but since the instructions say \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", maybe they want the answer in the box as boxed{4k}. But sometimes, for such problems, you might need to list in another way if there are specific n, but here it's an infinite set. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the modulus, like n ≡ 0 (mod 4), but written as boxed{4mathbb{N}}. However, the standard way in math problems is to write boxed{4k} where k is a positive integer. But since the user might expect just the form inside the box without the qualification, perhaps the problem expects the answer as n is divisible by 4, so the boxed answer is boxed{4k}.But looking at examples from similar problems, usually, when the answer is an infinite set of numbers, they write it in the form n = 4k, k ∈ N inside a box. However, due to formatting constraints, maybe simply boxed{4k}. Alternatively, if the problem expects a specific symbol, but I think boxed{4k} is acceptable.Alternatively, in some textbooks, they denote the set as {4, 8, 12, ...}, but writing that in a box is difficult. So the most concise is boxed{4k} where k is a natural number. However, given the user might want the answer as boxed{4} if there's only one solution, but no, the solutions are all multiples. Hence, the answer is all natural numbers divisible by 4, represented as boxed{4k} for natural numbers k.Final Answerboxed{4k} where ( k ) is a natural number. However, following the user's instruction to put the final answer within boxed{}, and considering standard mathematical notation, the answer should be presented as:boxed{4mathbb{N}}But this notation might not be common. Alternatively, the problem might expect the answer as \\"all multiples of 4\\", which in LaTeX can be written using boxed{4k} with an explanation. But given the constraints, the most appropriate is:boxed{4k} where ( k ) is a natural number.But since the problem says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", perhaps indicating a single boxed expression. In some contexts, writing boxed{4mathbb{N}} is acceptable, but if not, maybe stating the general form inside the box. Since multiple answers might require a set notation, but given that it's an infinite set, the standard way is to present the form. Hence, I'll go with:boxed{4k} for some natural number ( k ).But the system might expect just the boxed part without the words. Given that, and considering the problem is in English, perhaps the answer is n = 4k, which can be written as boxed{4k}. Alternatively, the problem might accept boxed{4} if it's a common divisor, but no, the answer is all multiples. Therefore, the correct boxed answer is boxed{4k}.Final Answerboxed{4k}But wait, actually, in many mathematical problems, when asking for all natural numbers n in terms of a parameter, it's common to write n = 4k with k ∈ ℕ, but boxed as boxed{4k}. However, the user's initial problem statement might expect the answer as n is divisible by 4, hence n ≡ 0 mod 4, but written as boxed{4k}. Yes, I think boxed{4k} is the appropriate answer here.</think>To determine all natural numbers ( n ) for which the number ( z = left( frac{3 + i}{2 - i} right)^n ) is real, we start by simplifying the given complex number.First, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it:[frac{3 + i}{2 - i} cdot frac{2 + i}{2 + i} = frac{(3 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)}]Calculating the numerator:[(3 + i)(2 + i) = 3 cdot 2 + 3 cdot i + i cdot 2 + i cdot i = 6 + 3i + 2i + i^2 = 6 + 5i - 1 = 5 + 5i]Calculating the denominator:[(2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5]Thus, the simplified form is:[frac{5 + 5i}{5} = 1 + i]Next, we need to find ( n ) such that ( (1 + i)^n ) is real. Converting ( 1 + i ) to polar form, we have:- Modulus: ( sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2} )- Argument: ( frac{pi}{4} )In polar form, ( 1 + i = sqrt{2} left( cos frac{pi}{4} + i sin frac{pi}{4} right) ). Raising this to the power ( n ):[(1 + i)^n = (sqrt{2})^n left( cos frac{npi}{4} + i sin frac{npi}{4} right)]For the result to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, which occurs when ( sin frac{npi}{4} = 0 ). This happens when ( frac{npi}{4} ) is an integer multiple of ( pi ):[frac{npi}{4} = kpi implies frac{n}{4} = k implies n = 4k quad text{for some integer } k geq 1]Thus, the natural numbers ( n ) are all multiples of 4. The final answer is:[boxed{4k}]]"},{"problem":"5.1. It is known that in the past chess tournament, in each round all players were paired, the loser was eliminated (there were no draws). It is known that the winner played 6 games. How many participants in the tournament won at least 2 games more than they lost?","solution":"Answer: 8Solution. Since the winner played 6 games, there were a total of 2^{6}=64 players. The win-loss ratio for those eliminated in the 1st round is -1; for those who lost in the 2nd round, it is 0; for those who lost in the 3rd round, it is +1; for those who lost in the 4th round and beyond, it is at least +2. 8 participants reached the 4th round.","generations":"[<think>Alright, let's tackle this chess tournament problem. Hmm, the question is asking how many participants won at least 2 games more than they lost. The winner played 6 games, so maybe that gives us a clue about the structure of the tournament.First, let me recall how single-elimination tournaments work. In each round, players are paired, the loser gets eliminated, and the winner moves on. Since there are no byes or draws mentioned, each round must have an even number of players to pair them all. The tournament continues until only one player remains as the winner.The winner played 6 games. That probably means there were 6 rounds because each round the winner would have to play one game. Wait, but each round halves the number of players, right? So if the winner played 6 games, that suggests there were 6 rounds, which would mean the number of participants is 2^6 = 64? Because each round halves the players, starting from 64, then 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. But wait, 2^6 is 64, but if you have 6 rounds, the number of players would be 2^6, which is 64. So that seems logical. So maybe there were 64 participants.But the question is not about the total number of participants, but how many of them won at least 2 games more than they lost. Hmm. Let's think. Each participant except the winner is eliminated at some point. So each player's number of wins is equal to the number of rounds they survived. Their number of losses is 1, except for the winner who has 0 losses. Wait, but in each round, if you lose, you're eliminated. So every player except the winner has exactly 1 loss. The winner has 0 losses.So for each player, the number of wins is equal to the number of games they played minus 1 (since they lost the last game they played). Except for the winner, who has 6 wins and 0 losses.So, we need to find the number of players who have at least 2 more wins than losses. Since each player's losses are either 0 (the winner) or 1 (everyone else), their number of wins minus losses is (wins - 0) for the winner and (wins - 1) for others. So we need players for whom either (wins - 0) >= 2 or (wins - 1) >= 2. For the winner, that's 6 - 0 = 6, which is certainly >=2. For others, (wins -1) >=2 means wins >=3. So we need all players who either are the winner (6 wins) or have at least 3 wins (which would translate to 3 -1 = 2 more wins than losses). Wait, but the question is \\"at least 2 games more than they lost.\\" So for non-winners, since they have 1 loss, their number of wins must be at least 3 (since 3 -1 =2). So yes, players who won 3 or more games. So we need the number of players who won 3,4,5, or 6 games. But the winner is the only one with 6 wins. Then players with 5 wins would be those who made it to the final but lost, right? Wait, no. Wait, if the tournament has 6 rounds, each player's number of wins is equal to the number of rounds they survived. So the winner survived 6 rounds, so 6 wins. The finalist would have survived 5 rounds (since they lost in the 6th round), so 5 wins. Similarly, the semi-finalists would have 4 wins, quarter-finalists 3 wins, and so on.Wait, let's confirm. If there are 6 rounds, starting with 64 players:Round 1: 64 players, 32 games. 32 losers (1 win?), wait no. Wait, in each round, the loser is eliminated. So each player's number of wins is how many rounds they won. So for example, in Round 1, all 64 players play. The 32 winners move on. Those 32 losers have 0 wins and 1 loss. Then in Round 2, the 32 winners from Round 1 play, resulting in 16 winners. The 16 losers have 1 win and 1 loss. Then Round 3: 16 players, 8 winners. The 8 losers have 2 wins, 1 loss. Round 4: 8 players, 4 winners. The 4 losers have 3 wins, 1 loss. Round 5: 4 players, 2 winners. The 2 losers have 4 wins, 1 loss. Round 6: 2 players, 1 winner (6 wins, 0 losses) and 1 loser (5 wins, 1 loss). Ah, so the losers in each round have (round number -1) wins. So for example, losers in Round 1 have 0 wins, Round 2 losers have 1 win, Round 3 losers have 2 wins, etc., up to Round 6 loser (the finalist) has 5 wins. So each round's losers have (k-1) wins, where k is the round number.Therefore, the number of players with exactly m wins is equal to the number of losers in round (m+1). Because if you lose in round (m+1), you have m wins. Except for the winner, who has 6 wins and didn't lose any round.So for example:- 0 wins: losers in Round 1: 32 players- 1 win: losers in Round 2: 16 players- 2 wins: losers in Round 3: 8 players- 3 wins: losers in Round 4: 4 players- 4 wins: losers in Round 5: 2 players- 5 wins: loser in Round 6: 1 player- 6 wins: winner: 1 playerSo total players: 32 +16 +8 +4 +2 +1 +1 = 64, which checks out.Now, the question is asking for the number of participants who won at least 2 games more than they lost. Let's parse this.Each participant's \\"games won\\" minus \\"games lost\\" is:- For the winner: 6 - 0 = 6- For the loser of Round 6: 5 - 1 = 4- Losers of Round 5: 4 -1 =3- Losers of Round 4: 3 -1 =2- Losers of Round 3: 2 -1 =1- Losers of Round 2:1 -1=0- Losers of Round 1:0 -1=-1So \\"at least 2 games more than they lost\\" translates to (Wins - Losses) >=2.Looking at the above:- Winner: 6 >=2 ✅- Round 6 loser:4 >=2 ✅- Round 5 losers:3 >=2 ✅- Round 4 losers:2 >=2 ✅- Round 3 losers:1 <2 ❌- Round 2 losers:0 <2 ❌- Round 1 losers:-1 <2 ❌Therefore, the participants who meet the criteria are:- The winner (1 person)- The Round 6 loser (1 person)- Round 5 losers (2 people)- Round 4 losers (4 people)Wait, wait, let me check:Wait, the Round 4 losers: how many are there? In Round 4, there are 8 players, which get paired into 4 games, so 4 losers. Each of these 4 losers has 3 wins (since they lost in Round 4). Wait, but according to the previous breakdown, losers in Round 4 have 3 wins. But their (wins - losses) would be 3 -1=2. So they have exactly 2 more wins than losses. Since the question is \\"at least 2\\", they are included.Similarly, Round 5 losers: in Round 5, there are 4 players, so 2 games, 2 losers. These losers have 4 wins each (they lost in Round 5). So 4 -1=3, which is 3 more wins than losses. So they are included.Round 6 loser: 1 person, 5 wins -1 loss=4, so included.Winner: 6-0=6, included.Therefore, the total number is:- 1 (winner)- 1 (Round 6 loser)- 2 (Round 5 losers)- 4 (Round 4 losers)Total: 1+1+2+4=8.Wait, 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8? Wait, 1 (winner) +1 (Round 6) +2 (Round 5) +4 (Round 4) = 8 participants.But let's verify:Round 4: 8 players, 4 losers (each with 3 wins, 1 loss). So 4 players.Round 5: 4 players, 2 losers (each with 4 wins, 1 loss). 2 players.Round 6: 2 players, 1 loser (5 wins, 1 loss). 1 player.Winner: 1 player (6 wins, 0 losses).So total: 4 +2 +1 +1=8.Yes, that's 8 participants who have at least 2 more wins than losses.But wait, the problem says \\"participants in the tournament won at least 2 games more than they lost\\". So for each participant, compute (number of games won) - (number of games lost). If that is >=2, count them. The answer is 8.Therefore, the final answer should be boxed{8}.But let me check again, just to be thorough.Total participants:64.Number of players with at least 2 more wins than losses:From Round 4 losers: 4 players (3 wins, 1 loss: 3-1=2)Round 5 losers:2 players (4-1=3)Round 6 loser:1 player (5-1=4)Winner:1 player (6-0=6)Total:4+2+1+1=8. Yep.Alternatively, think of each round:Each round, starting from the final rounds, the players who made it to Round 4 or later. Wait, Round 4 is the quarterfinals? Wait, 6 rounds:Round 1:64→32Round 2:32→16Round 3:16→8Round 4:8→4Round 5:4→2Round 6:2→1So Round 4 is the quarterfinals (8 players), Round 5 is semifinals (4→2), Round 6 is final (2→1). So making it to the quarterfinals (Round 4) means you have 3 wins. So those who made it to quarterfinals, semifinals, finals, and the winner. The number of such players is:Quarterfinalists:8 players (but 4 losers in Round4, 4 move on)Semifinalists:4 players (2 losers in Round5, 2 move on)Finalists:2 players (1 loser in Round6, 1 winner)So total players in quarterfinals:8But quarterfinalists include those who lost in quarterfinals (4) and those who went on (4). Similarly, the total number of players who made it to Round4 or later is 8 (quarterfinalists). But the question is about how many participants in the tournament won at least 2 games more than they lost. So participants include all 64, but only 8 of them have W-L >=2. So the answer is 8.Yes, that seems right. Therefore, the answer is boxed{8}.Final Answerboxed{8}</think>The problem involves determining how many participants in a chess tournament won at least 2 games more than they lost. The winner played 6 games, indicating there were 6 rounds and 64 participants (since each round halves the number of players, starting from (2^6 = 64)).Key steps:1. Understanding the tournament structure: Each round halves the number of players. The winner played 6 games, so there are 6 rounds.2. Determining wins and losses: Each player's number of wins is the number of rounds they survived. The winner has 6 wins and 0 losses. Other players have 1 loss (eliminated in a round) and wins equal to the rounds they survived.3. Calculating the difference between wins and losses:   - The winner: (6 - 0 = 6)   - Losers in Round 6 (final): (5 - 1 = 4)   - Losers in Round 5 (semifinals): (4 - 1 = 3)   - Losers in Round 4 (quarterfinals): (3 - 1 = 2)   - Losers in earlier rounds have differences less than 2.4. Counting participants with at least 2 more wins than losses:   - Winner: 1 player   - Loser in Round 6: 1 player   - Losers in Round 5: 2 players   - Losers in Round 4: 4 playersSumming these, we get (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8).Thus, the number of participants who won at least 2 games more than they lost is (boxed{8}).,<think>Okay, let's try to figure out this chess tournament problem. So, the question is: In a past chess tournament, each round all players were paired, the loser was eliminated (no draws). The winner played 6 games. How many participants in the tournament won at least 2 games more than they lost?Hmm. Let's start by breaking down the information given. First, it's a single-elimination tournament. That means every time a player loses a game, they're out of the tournament. There are no draws, so every game has a winner and a loser. Each round, all remaining players are paired up, so each round has half the number of players as the previous round (assuming an even number of players). The winner of the tournament played 6 games. So, they had to win 6 games to be the champion. The question is asking how many participants won at least 2 games more than they lost. So, for each participant, we need to consider their number of wins minus their number of losses. If this difference is at least 2, then they are counted. We need to find how many such participants there were in the tournament.Let me think. Since it's a single-elimination tournament, each loss eliminates a player. So, except for the winner, every other player lost exactly once. The winner never lost. So, the number of losses for each player is either 0 (for the winner) or 1 (for everyone else). Wait a second, but the number of games a player plays is equal to the number of rounds they survived. For example, if a player is eliminated in the first round, they played 1 game (and lost it). If they survived to the second round, they played 2 games, and so on. The winner played 6 games, which means they won 6 games, and the tournament had 6 rounds. Therefore, the number of participants must have been 2^6 = 64, right? Because each round halves the number of players. So, starting with 64 players, after 6 rounds, you have 1 winner. But let me confirm that. If the winner played 6 games, that means they started in the first round, won, then the second round, won, etc., up to the 6th round. So each round halves the number of players. Hence, the starting number is 2^6 = 64. So, 64 participants. But the question is not asking for the number of participants, but how many of them won at least 2 games more than they lost. Each player's number of wins is equal to the number of games they played minus the number of losses. Since each player can only lose once (except the winner, who didn't lose at all), the number of losses is either 0 or 1. So, for all players except the winner, their number of losses is 1, and their number of wins is equal to the number of games they played minus 1. For the winner, losses are 0, and wins are 6.So, the difference between wins and losses for each player is (wins - losses). For the winner, it's 6 - 0 = 6. For a player who played k games, it's (k - 1) - 1 = k - 2. Wait, hold on: if a player played k games, they must have lost the kth game, so their number of wins is k - 1, and losses is 1. So, the difference is (k - 1) - 1 = k - 2. Therefore, we need to find all players for whom k - 2 >= 2, which implies k >= 4. So, players who played 4 or more games have a difference of at least 2. Therefore, the number of participants who won at least 2 games more than they lost is equal to the number of players who played 4 or more games. Let's check this reasoning.Each player who was eliminated in the first round played 1 game, so their difference is (0 - 1) = -1.Eliminated in the second round: played 2 games, 1 win, 1 loss. Difference: 0.Third round: 3 games, 2 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 1.Fourth round: 4 games, 3 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 2.Fifth round: 5 games, 4 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 3.Sixth round: 6 games (only the winner), 6 wins, 0 losses. Difference: 6.So, the question is asking for the number of participants with a difference of at least 2. That would be players eliminated in the fourth round (difference 2), fifth round (difference 3), and the winner (difference 6). So, how many players are in each of those categories?In a single-elimination tournament with 64 players:- Round 1: 64 players, 32 games. 32 losers (eliminated in Round 1), 32 winners move to Round 2.- Round 2: 32 players, 16 games. 16 losers (eliminated in Round 2), 16 winners move to Round 3.- Round 3: 16 players, 8 games. 8 losers (eliminated in Round 3), 8 winners move to Round 4.- Round 4: 8 players, 4 games. 4 losers (eliminated in Round 4), 4 winners move to Round 5.- Round 5: 4 players, 2 games. 2 losers (eliminated in Round 5), 2 winners move to Round 6.- Round 6: 2 players, 1 game. 1 loser (eliminated in Round 6), 1 winner.So, players eliminated in Round 4: 4 players (they played 4 games, difference 2).Players eliminated in Round 5: 2 players (played 5 games, difference 3).Players eliminated in Round 6: 1 player (the final loser, played 6 games, difference 5). Wait, wait. Wait, the winner played 6 games, but the loser of Round 6 (the final) played 6 games as well? Wait, let me check.Wait, in each round, the players are paired. So, if the tournament has 64 players, each round halves the number of players. So:Round 1: 64 players, 32 games. 32 move on.Round 2: 32 players, 16 games. 16 move on.Round 3: 16 players, 8 games. 8 move on.Round 4: 8 players, 4 games. 4 move on.Round 5: 4 players, 2 games. 2 move on.Round 6: 2 players, 1 game. 1 winner.Wait, so the final is Round 6. The loser of Round 6 is the runner-up, who played 6 games. So, in Round 6, the two players have each played 5 games prior to Round 6, right? Wait, no. Let's think carefully.Each time you win, you move to the next round. So, the number of games a player has played is equal to the number of rounds they participated in. For example, to get to Round 2, you had to win Round 1, so you played 1 game. To get to Round 3, you had to win Rounds 1 and 2, so 2 games. So, the number of games a player has played when they are eliminated is equal to the round in which they lost.Wait, if a player is eliminated in Round k, they lost their kth game. Therefore, they must have won (k - 1) games. So, the number of games they played is k. So, the difference between wins and losses is (k - 1) - 1 = k - 2. Therefore, if a player is eliminated in Round 4, they played 4 games, difference 4 - 2 = 2. Similarly, eliminated in Round 5: 5 - 2 = 3, and the winner was never eliminated, so they played 6 games, 6 wins, difference 6. The runner-up (loser of Round 6) played 6 games, with 5 wins and 1 loss, so difference 4. Wait, wait, this contradicts earlier reasoning. Hmm, let's clarify.Wait, in Round 6, the two remaining players play each other. The winner is the champion, the loser is the runner-up. The runner-up would have played 6 games (since they had to win 5 rounds to get to the final, then lost the 6th). So, their record is 5 wins and 1 loss, so 5 - 1 = 4. Therefore, the difference is 4. So, the runner-up would have a difference of 4. Wait, but according to the previous logic, players eliminated in Round k have difference k - 2. But the runner-up is eliminated in Round 6, so k = 6, so difference 6 - 2 = 4. That's correct. Then the champion has 6 wins, 0 losses, difference 6.Therefore, the participants who have a difference of at least 2 are those eliminated in Round 4, 5, 6, and the champion. Wait, the champion is not eliminated, but they have a difference of 6.Wait, let's list all possible elimination rounds and their corresponding differences:- Eliminated in Round 1: 1 game played, 0 wins, 1 loss. Difference: -1.- Round 2: 2 games, 1 win, 1 loss. Difference: 0.- Round 3: 3 games, 2 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 1.- Round 4: 4 games, 3 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 2.- Round 5: 5 games, 4 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 3.- Round 6: 6 games, 5 wins, 1 loss. Difference: 4.- Champion: 6 games, 6 wins, 0 losses. Difference: 6.So, the question is asking for participants who have at least 2 more wins than losses. So, difference >= 2. That includes:- Those eliminated in Round 4 (difference 2)- Eliminated in Round 5 (difference 3)- Eliminated in Round 6 (difference 4)- The champion (difference 6)So, how many players are in each of these categories?In a tournament with 64 players:- Eliminated in Round 1: 32 players- Round 2: 16 players- Round 3: 8 players- Round 4: 4 players- Round 5: 2 players- Round 6: 1 player (the runner-up)- Champion: 1 playerSo, the participants with difference >=2 are:- Round 4: 4 players- Round 5: 2 players- Round 6: 1 player- Champion: 1 playerTotal: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 participants.Wait, but let me verify that. Let's count:- Round 4: 4 losers, each played 4 games, difference 2.- Round 5: 2 losers, each played 5 games, difference 3.- Round 6: 1 loser, played 6 games, difference 4.- Champion: 1 player, difference 6.So, total participants with difference >=2: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.But hold on, the problem says \\"participants in the tournament\\". The tournament started with 64 participants, so all of them are counted, even if they lost early. But we need to count how many of the original participants had at least 2 more wins than losses. But in our analysis, the players eliminated in Round 4, 5, 6, and the champion are the ones with difference >=2. So, 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.But let me double-check. Let's see:Each round halves the players, so starting from 64:Round 1: 64 -> 32Round 2: 32 -> 16Round 3: 16 -> 8Round 4: 8 -> 4Round 5: 4 -> 2Round 6: 2 -> 1So, the number of losers in each round is:Round 1: 32Round 2: 16Round 3: 8Round 4: 4Round 5: 2Round 6: 1Plus the winner: 1Total participants: 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 64. Correct.Now, the losers in Round 4: 4 players, each with 3 wins and 1 loss (difference 2).Losers in Round 5: 2 players, 4 wins, 1 loss (difference 3).Loser in Round 6: 1 player, 5 wins, 1 loss (difference 4).Winner: 1 player, 6 wins, 0 losses (difference 6).Therefore, the total number of participants with at least 2 more wins than losses: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8. So, 8 participants.Therefore, the answer is boxed{8}.Final Answerboxed{8}</think>Given a single-elimination chess tournament where each round pairs all remaining players and the loser is eliminated (with no draws), we need to determine how many participants won at least 2 games more than they lost.

Let me first write down the function properly to make sure I have it right. The function is:f(x, y) = x³ + y³ + x²y + xy² - 3(x² + y² + xy) + 3(x + y)Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to see if I can simplify this expression or maybe factor it somehow. Maybe grouping terms would help.First, let's expand and combine like terms. Let me compute each part step by step.Starting with the first part: x³ + y³. Then, x²y + xy². So those are the cubic and quadratic terms. Then subtracting 3 times (x² + y² + xy), and then adding 3(x + y). Let me write each term:1. x³ + y³2. + x²y + xy²3. -3x² -3y² -3xy4. +3x +3ySo combining all these terms together. Let me group similar terms:For x³ and y³: they remain as is, x³ + y³.For x²y and xy²: those are the mixed cubic terms.Then the quadratic terms: -3x² -3y² -3xy.Then linear terms: +3x +3y.Hmm. Let me check if there's any symmetry here. The function seems symmetric in x and y, except for the mixed terms. Let me see if substituting x = y would help. Since the problem is symmetric in x and y, the minimum might occur at a point where x = y. That might be a good starting point.Let me assume x = y and see what the function becomes. If x = y, then:f(x, x) = x³ + x³ + x²x + x x² - 3(x² + x² + x²) + 3(x + x)Simplify each term:= 2x³ + 2x³ - 3(3x²) + 3(2x)Wait, wait, hold on. Let me do that step by step.First term: x³ + y³ becomes x³ + x³ = 2x³.Second term: x²y + xy² becomes x²x + x x² = x³ + x³ = 2x³.Third term: -3(x² + y² + xy) becomes -3(x² + x² + x²) = -3(3x²) = -9x².Fourth term: +3(x + y) becomes +3(x + x) = 6x.So combining all that:2x³ + 2x³ -9x² +6x = 4x³ -9x² +6x.Therefore, when x = y, f(x, x) = 4x³ -9x² +6x.Now, to find the minimum of this single-variable function for x ≥ 1/2.Let me denote g(x) = 4x³ -9x² +6x.To find the minimum of g(x) for x ≥ 1/2, I can take the derivative and find critical points.Compute g'(x):g'(x) = 12x² - 18x +6.Set derivative equal to zero:12x² -18x +6 = 0.Divide both sides by 6:2x² -3x +1 = 0.Solve the quadratic equation:x = [3 ± sqrt(9 -8)] /4 = [3 ±1]/4.Thus, x = (3 +1)/4 = 1, or x = (3 -1)/4 = 0.5.So critical points at x = 1 and x = 0.5. But since x must be at least 0.5, these are both within the domain. So we need to evaluate g(x) at x = 0.5 and x =1, and check if there's any other critical points in between.Wait, but x =0.5 is the boundary point, and x=1 is another critical point. Let's compute the function values.At x =0.5:g(0.5) = 4*(0.5)^3 -9*(0.5)^2 +6*(0.5) = 4*(0.125) -9*(0.25) +3 = 0.5 -2.25 +3 = 1.25.At x=1:g(1) =4*1 -9*1 +6*1 =4 -9 +6=1.So at x=1, g(x)=1, and at x=0.5, g(x)=1.25.But we need to check also the behavior of g(x) as x increases beyond 1. Since the leading term is 4x³, which tends to infinity as x increases, the function will go to infinity. Therefore, the minimum in the domain x ≥0.5 is at x=1 with value 1.But wait, but is x=1 allowed? The problem states x, y ≥1/2. So x=1 is allowed. So if the minimum when x=y is 1 at (1,1), but we need to check if there's a lower value when x ≠ y.Because maybe the minimum occurs at a point where x ≠ y. So even though the function is symmetric, sometimes the minimum can occur on the boundary where variables are not equal.So, to be thorough, we need to check the original function f(x, y) in the domain x ≥1/2, y ≥1/2. The critical points could be either in the interior where both x and y are greater than 1/2, or on the boundary where one or both variables are equal to 1/2.First, let's check the critical points in the interior. To do that, compute the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y, set them to zero, and solve.Let me compute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.First, compute ∂f/∂x:The terms in f(x, y):x³: derivative 3x²y³: derivative 0x²y: derivative 2xyxy²: derivative y²-3x²: derivative -6x-3y²: derivative 0-3xy: derivative -3y+3x: derivative 3+3y: derivative 0So summing up:∂f/∂x = 3x² + 2xy + y² -6x -3y +3Similarly, ∂f/∂y:x³: 0y³: 3y²x²y: x²xy²: 2xy-3x²: 0-3y²: -6y-3xy: -3x+3x:0+3y:3Thus,∂f/∂y = 3y² + x² + 2xy -6y -3x +3Since the function is symmetric, the derivatives are symmetric as well.Set ∂f/∂x =0 and ∂f/∂y=0.So the system of equations is:3x² + 2xy + y² -6x -3y +3 =03y² + x² + 2xy -6y -3x +3 =0Since the equations are symmetric, subtracting them might help. Let's subtract the second equation from the first:[3x² + 2xy + y² -6x -3y +3] - [3y² + x² + 2xy -6y -3x +3] =0 -0Compute term by term:3x² - x² = 2x²2xy -2xy =0y² -3y² = -2y²-6x -(-3x) = -6x +3x = -3x-3y -(-6y) = -3y +6y =3y3 -3 =0So overall:2x² -2y² -3x +3y=0Factor this equation:2(x² - y²) -3(x - y)=0Factor (x² - y²) as (x - y)(x + y):2(x - y)(x + y) -3(x - y) =0Factor out (x - y):(x - y)[2(x + y) -3] =0Therefore, either x = y or 2(x + y) -3=0.So the critical points occur either when x=y or when x + y = 3/2.So, first case: x = y.Then, as we already considered before, substituting x=y into one of the original equations.Take the first equation: 3x² + 2x² + x² -6x -3x +3=0.Wait, let's substitute y =x into ∂f/∂x =0:3x² + 2x*x +x² -6x -3x +3=0Simplify:3x² +2x² +x² -6x -3x +3=0 ⇒ (3+2+1)x² + (-6 -3)x +3=0 ⇒6x² -9x +3=0Divide by 3:2x² -3x +1=0Which is the same equation as before. So x=1 or x=0.5. Therefore, critical points at (1,1) and (0.5, 0.5). These are the same as found earlier.Second case: 2(x + y) -3=0 ⇒x + y= 3/2.So now we have to solve the system:x + y= 3/2,and the original equations:3x² + 2xy + y² -6x -3y +3 =0.Let me use x + y= 3/2. Let's denote s =x + y=3/2, and p=xy.But maybe express y in terms of x: y= (3/2) -x.Substitute y= (3/2 -x) into the first equation:3x² +2x(3/2 -x) + (3/2 -x)^2 -6x -3(3/2 -x) +3=0Let me compute each term step by step.First term: 3x²Second term: 2x*(3/2 -x) = 3x -2x²Third term: (3/2 -x)^2 = (9/4 -3x +x²)Fourth term: -6xFifth term: -3*(3/2 -x) = -9/2 +3xSixth term: +3So now combine all terms:3x² + (3x -2x²) + (9/4 -3x +x²) -6x + (-9/2 +3x) +3Let me expand and collect like terms:3x² +3x -2x² +9/4 -3x +x² -6x -9/2 +3x +3Combine x² terms: 3x² -2x² +x² = 2x²Combine x terms: 3x -3x -6x +3x = (-3x)Constants: 9/4 -9/2 +3Convert 9/4 -9/2 to 9/4 -18/4 = -9/4, then -9/4 +3 = -9/4 +12/4=3/4Thus, overall equation is:2x² -3x +3/4=0Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:8x² -12x +3=0Solve quadratic equation:x = [12 ± sqrt(144 -96)] /16 = [12 ± sqrt(48)] /16 = [12 ±4*sqrt(3)] /16 = [3 ±sqrt(3)] /4Therefore, x= [3 + sqrt(3)] /4 or x= [3 - sqrt(3)] /4Compute numerical values:sqrt(3)≈1.732So x≈(3 +1.732)/4≈4.732/4≈1.183x≈(3 -1.732)/4≈1.268/4≈0.317But wait, our domain is x ≥1/2=0.5. So x≈0.317 is less than 0.5, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only valid solution in the domain is x≈1.183, but 3/2=1.5, so y=3/2 -x≈1.5 -1.183≈0.317, which is also less than 0.5. Therefore, this critical point is at x≈1.183, y≈0.317, but since y must be ≥0.5, this point is not in the domain. Similarly, the other solution x≈0.317 would lead to y≈1.183, but x=0.317 is less than 0.5. Therefore, both solutions for x in this case lead to either x or y being less than 1/2. Hence, these critical points are outside the domain. Therefore, there are no critical points with x + y=3/2 inside the domain x, y ≥1/2.Therefore, the only critical points inside the domain are (1,1) and (0.5,0.5).But we need to check the boundaries as well. The boundaries occur when either x=1/2 or y=1/2 (or both). So we need to check the function on the edges of the domain.So, to find the global minimum, we need to check:1. Critical points inside the domain: (1,1) and (0.5,0.5). Wait, actually (0.5, 0.5) is on the boundary, since both x and y are at their minimum.But in the case where x = y, the point (0.5,0.5) is indeed on the corner of the domain.So, besides the critical points, we need to check the boundaries:a) x=1/2, y ≥1/2b) y=1/2, x ≥1/2c) Both x=1/2 and y=1/2 (which is the point (0.5,0.5))So let's handle each case.First, let's check the function at the critical points:(1,1): f(1,1)=1³+1³+1²*1 +1*1² -3(1² +1² +1*1)+3(1 +1)Compute step by step:1 +1 +1 +1 -3(1 +1 +1) +3(2)=4 -3*3 +6=4 -9 +6=1, as before.(0.5,0.5): f(0.5,0.5)= (0.5)^3 + (0.5)^3 + (0.5)^2*0.5 +0.5*(0.5)^2 -3[(0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 +0.5*0.5] +3(0.5 +0.5)Compute each term:First two terms: 0.125 +0.125=0.25Next two terms: (0.25*0.5)+(0.5*0.25)=0.125 +0.125=0.25Then the -3 term: -3[0.25 +0.25 +0.25] = -3*0.75= -2.25Then the +3 term: +3*1=3Sum all together: 0.25 +0.25 -2.25 +3= (0.5 -2.25) +3= (-1.75) +3=1.25.So as before, f(0.5,0.5)=1.25.Now, check the boundaries.Case a: x=1/2, y ≥1/2. Then f(1/2, y). Let's write this as a function of y and find its minimum for y ≥1/2.Similarly, case b: y=1/2, x ≥1/2. Since the function is symmetric, the minimum in case a and case b will be the same. So we can compute one and it applies to the other.Let's compute f(1/2, y):f(1/2, y)= (1/2)^3 + y^3 + (1/2)^2 y + (1/2) y^2 -3[(1/2)^2 + y^2 + (1/2)y] +3(1/2 + y)Compute each term:(1/2)^3=1/8y^3 remains(1/2)^2 y = (1/4)y(1/2)y^2= (1/2)y^2Then -3[(1/2)^2 + y^2 + (1/2)y] = -3[1/4 + y^2 + (1/2)y] = -3/4 -3y^2 - (3/2)yThen +3(1/2 + y)= 3/2 +3yNow, combine all terms:1/8 + y^3 + (1/4)y + (1/2)y^2 -3/4 -3y^2 - (3/2)y +3/2 +3yCombine like terms:y^3.For y² terms: (1/2)y² -3y² = (-5/2)y².For y terms: (1/4)y - (3/2)y +3y = (1/4 -3/2 +3)y = (1/4 -3/2 +12/4)y = (1 -6 +12)/4 y=7/4 y.Constant terms:1/8 -3/4 +3/2=1/8 -6/8 +12/8=(1 -6 +12)/8=7/8.Thus, f(1/2, y)= y^3 - (5/2)y² + (7/4)y +7/8.Now, to find the minimum of this function for y ≥1/2. Let's denote h(y)= y³ - (5/2)y² + (7/4)y +7/8.Compute derivative h’(y)=3y² -5y +7/4.Set h’(y)=0:3y² -5y +7/4=0.Multiply by 4 to eliminate fractions:12y² -20y +7=0.Solve quadratic equation:y = [20 ±sqrt(400 -336)] /24= [20 ±sqrt(64)] /24= [20 ±8]/24.Thus,y=(20+8)/24=28/24=7/6≈1.1667,or y=(20-8)/24=12/24=0.5.Therefore, critical points at y=7/6 and y=0.5.But y must be ≥1/2. So both points are in the domain. So we need to evaluate h(y) at y=0.5 and y=7/6, as well as check the limit as y approaches infinity.As y→∞, h(y)=y³ - (5/2)y² +... tends to infinity, so the minimum must be at one of the critical points or at y=0.5.Compute h(0.5):h(0.5)= (0.5)^3 - (5/2)(0.5)^2 + (7/4)(0.5) +7/8=0.125 - (5/2)(0.25) + (7/4)(0.5) +0.875=0.125 -0.625 +0.875 +0.875Compute step by step:0.125 -0.625= -0.5-0.5 +0.875=0.3750.375 +0.875=1.25.So h(0.5)=1.25, which matches f(0.5,0.5)=1.25.Now compute h(7/6):First, 7/6≈1.1667.Compute each term:y³= (7/6)^3=343/216≈1.587-(5/2)y²=-(5/2)*(49/36)= - (5/2)*(49/36)= -245/72≈-3.4028(7/4)y= (7/4)*(7/6)=49/24≈2.04177/8=0.875Sum all terms:343/216 -245/72 +49/24 +7/8Convert all to 216 denominator:343/216 -245/72*(3/3)= -735/216 +49/24*(9/9)=441/216 +7/8*(27/27)=189/216So:343 -735 +441 +189 = (343 +441 +189) -735= (973) -735=238Therefore, 238/216=119/108≈1.10185.So h(7/6)=119/108≈1.10185.Which is less than 1.25. Therefore, the minimum on the boundary x=1/2 is ≈1.10185 at y=7/6.But wait, y=7/6≈1.1667 and x=1/2. So this point (0.5, 7/6) is within the domain since x=0.5 and y≈1.1667≥0.5.Similarly, on the boundary y=1/2, x≥0.5, by symmetry, the function will have the same minimum value at (7/6, 0.5), which is also≈1.10185.Therefore, the minimum on the boundaries x=1/2 or y=1/2 is≈1.10185, which is lower than the value at (1,1)=1 and at (0.5,0.5)=1.25.So that suggests that the overall minimum might be at (0.5,7/6) or (7/6,0.5), but we need to check if this is indeed the case, and whether this is the global minimum.But let's compute the exact value at (0.5,7/6).We had h(7/6)=119/108≈1.10185.But 119/108 is approximately 1.10185. Let's see if this is the exact minimum, or if there's a lower value elsewhere.But so far, the critical points inside the domain gave us (1,1) with f=1, and (0.5,0.5) with f=1.25. The boundaries x=0.5 and y=0.5 gave us points with f≈1.10185. So 1 is less than 1.10185, so the current candidate for minimum is 1 at (1,1). Wait, but 1 is less than 1.10185. So that would mean (1,1) is still the minimum? Wait, but this seems conflicting.Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.Wait, when we checked the critical points inside the domain, we found (1,1) with f=1, and (0.5,0.5) with f=1.25. Then, on the boundaries, x=0.5 or y=0.5, the minimal value found was≈1.10185, which is higher than 1. So the minimum would still be 1 at (1,1). However, the problem is that when we considered critical points on the boundary x=0.5, we found a lower value than at (0.5,0.5), but it's still higher than 1.Wait, but I need to check if the function can attain a lower value somewhere else. Maybe when both x and y are on the boundary, but different from the corners. Wait, but the boundaries are either x=0.5 or y=0.5. So if both are on the boundary, then we are at (0.5,0.5). If only one is on the boundary, then we have the cases we already checked. Therefore, the minimal value on the boundaries is≈1.10185, which is higher than the critical point inside the domain at (1,1) with f=1. Therefore, the minimal value is 1 at (1,1). But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought that maybe the minimum could be lower elsewhere. Wait, but according to this analysis, 1 is the minimal value.But wait, let me check the computation for the boundary minimum. Because when we found h(7/6)=119/108≈1.10185, which is approximately 1.102, which is greater than 1. So according to this, (1,1) is still the minimum. But perhaps there's a mistake in calculations.Wait, let me re-express h(y)= y³ - (5/2)y² + (7/4)y +7/8.Then h(7/6):First compute y=7/6.y³=(343)/(216)-(5/2)y²= -(5/2)*(49/36)= -(245/72)(7/4)y=(7/4)*(7/6)=49/247/8 remains.Now, sum all terms:343/216 -245/72 +49/24 +7/8Convert all to denominator 216:343/216 -245/72 *3/3= -735/216 +49/24 *9/9= 441/216 +7/8 *27/27=189/216.Now, 343 -735 +441 +189= (343 +441 +189) -735= (973) -735=238.So 238/216=119/108≈1.10185. Correct.So h(7/6)=119/108≈1.10185>1.Therefore, yes, the minimal value on the boundary is≈1.10185, which is higher than 1. Hence, (1,1) is the global minimum.But let's verify this with another approach. Maybe we can factor the original function.Looking back at the original function:f(x, y)=x³ +y³ +x²y +xy² -3(x² +y² +xy)+3(x + y)I wonder if this can be factored. Let me try to group terms.Notice that x³ + y³ +x²y +xy² can be written as x³ + x²y + xy² + y³= x²(x + y) + y²(x + y)= (x² + y²)(x + y). Alternatively, notice that x³ + y³ = (x + y)(x² -xy + y²), and x²y + xy²=xy(x + y). So combining:x³ + y³ +x²y +xy²= (x + y)(x² -xy + y²) +xy(x + y)= (x + y)(x² -xy + y² +xy)= (x + y)(x² + y²).Therefore, x³ + y³ +x²y +xy²=(x + y)(x² + y²)So the function becomes:f(x, y)= (x + y)(x² + y²) -3(x² + y² +xy) +3(x + y)Let me factor out (x² + y² +xy) from somewhere. Wait, perhaps group terms:= (x + y)(x² + y²) -3(x² + y² + xy) +3(x + y)Let me write it as:= (x + y)(x² + y²) +3(x + y) -3(x² + y² + xy)Factor (x + y) from the first and third terms:= (x + y)(x² + y² +3) -3(x² + y² + xy)Hmm, not sure if helpful. Alternatively, let me write x² + y² as (x + y)^2 - 2xy.So:(x + y)(x² + y²) = (x + y)[(x + y)^2 - 2xy] = (x + y)^3 - 2xy(x + y)Then the function f(x, y):= (x + y)^3 -2xy(x + y) -3(x² + y² +xy) +3(x + y)But again, not sure. Let me try to substitute s =x + y and p=xy.Then x² + y²= s² -2p, and x² + y² +xy= s² -2p +p= s² -p.So:f(x, y)= s*(s² -2p) -3(s² -p) +3sExpand:= s³ -2s p -3s² +3p +3sCombine terms:= s³ -3s² +3s -2s p +3pFactor terms with p:= s³ -3s² +3s +p(-2s +3)So f(x, y)=s³ -3s² +3s +p(-2s +3)But since s =x + y and p=xy, and x, y ≥1/2, perhaps we can express p in terms of s. However, for given s, p has a maximum and minimum. The maximum of p given s is when x=y=s/2, then p=(s/2)^2. The minimum p is when one variable is as small as possible, which would be 1/2, so p= (1/2)(s -1/2). Wait, for a fixed s, the minimum p occurs when one variable is 1/2 and the other is s -1/2. Since x, y ≥1/2, so s =x + y ≥1.Therefore, for s ≥1, the minimum p is (1/2)(s -1/2), and maximum p is (s/2)^2.But given f(x, y)=s³ -3s² +3s +p(-2s +3), and the coefficient of p is (-2s +3). The sign of this coefficient depends on s. If s < 3/2, then -2s +3 >0, so to minimize f, since p is multiplied by a positive term, we need to take p as small as possible. If s >3/2, then -2s +3 <0, so to minimize f, we need to take p as large as possible.Therefore, the minimum of f(x, y) for given s would depend on the value of s relative to 3/2.But this approach might be more complicated. Alternatively, let's consider that for given s, the value of f can be expressed in terms of s and p, but perhaps this substitution isn't leading us directly to the minimum.Alternatively, going back to the original function, maybe completing the cube or some other manipulation.Alternatively, notice that f(x, y) can be rewritten as:x³ + y³ +x²y +xy² -3x² -3y² -3xy +3x +3y.Let me group terms:= x³ -3x² +3x + y³ -3y² +3y +x²y +xy² -3xyNotice that x³ -3x² +3x is similar to (x -1)^3 +1. Let's check:(x -1)^3 =x³ -3x² +3x -1, so (x -1)^3 +1= x³ -3x² +3x.Similarly for the y terms: y³ -3y² +3y= (y -1)^3 +1.Therefore, f(x, y)= (x -1)^3 +1 + (y -1)^3 +1 +x²y +xy² -3xySimplify:= (x -1)^3 + (y -1)^3 +2 +x²y +xy² -3xyBut not sure if helpful. Let's compute x²y +xy² -3xy=xy(x + y -3).So f(x, y)= (x -1)^3 + (y -1)^3 +2 +xy(x + y -3)Alternatively, substitute variables u =x -1, v = y -1. Then x= u +1, y= v +1. Substitute into f(x, y):(u +1)^3 + (v +1)^3 + (u +1)^2(v +1) + (u +1)(v +1)^2 -3[(u +1)^2 + (v +1)^2 + (u +1)(v +1)] +3[(u +1) + (v +1)]This seems messy, but maybe expanding could lead to cancellation. Let me attempt:First term: (u +1)^3= u³ +3u² +3u +1Second term: (v +1)^3= v³ +3v² +3v +1Third term: (u +1)^2(v +1)= (u² +2u +1)(v +1)= u²v +u² +2uv +2u +v +1Fourth term: (u +1)(v +1)^2= (u +1)(v² +2v +1)=uv² +2uv +u +v² +2v +1Fifth term: -3[(u +1)^2 + (v +1)^2 + (u +1)(v +1)]= -3[u² +2u +1 +v² +2v +1 +uv +u +v +1]= -3[u² +v² +uv +3u +3v +3]Sixth term: +3[(u +1)+(v +1)]=3[u +v +2]Now, combine all these terms:First and second terms:u³ +3u² +3u +1 +v³ +3v² +3v +1= u³ +v³ +3u² +3v² +3u +3v +2Third term:u²v +u² +2uv +2u +v +1Fourth term:uv² +2uv +u +v² +2v +1Fifth term:-3u² -3v² -3uv -9u -9v -9Sixth term:3u +3v +6Now, combine all terms:Start with u³ +v³.Then, for u²v and uv² terms: u²v +uv².For u² and v² terms:3u² +3v² (from first terms) +u² +v² (from third and fourth terms) -3u² -3v² (from fifth term)So 3u² +3v² +u² +v² -3u² -3v²= (3u² +u² -3u²) + (3v² +v² -3v²)= u² +v².For uv terms:2uv (from third term) +2uv (from fourth term) -3uv (from fifth term)= (2+2-3)uv=1uv.For u and v terms:3u +3v (from first terms) +2u +v (from third term) +u +2v (from fourth term) -9u -9v (from fifth term) +3u +3v (from sixth term)Compute:3u +3v +2u +v +u +2v -9u -9v +3u +3vCombine like terms:For u: 3u +2u +u -9u +3u= (3+2+1-9+3)u=0uFor v:3v +v +2v -9v +3v= (3+1+2-9+3)v=0vSo all u and v terms cancel out.Constants:From first terms: 2From third term:1From fourth term:1From fifth term: -9From sixth term:6Total constants:2 +1 +1 -9 +6=1.So putting it all together:f(x, y)= u³ +v³ +u²v +uv² +u² +v² +uv +1.Hmm, interesting. So after substitution, f(x, y) simplifies to:u³ +v³ +u²v +uv² +u² +v² +uv +1.But this seems more complicated. Let me check if I made a mistake in the expansion. Because the result seems more complex, not simpler. Maybe this substitution wasn't helpful.Alternatively, maybe factor this expression.Looking at u³ +v³ +u²v +uv²= u³ +u²v +uv² +v³= u²(u +v) +v²(u +v)= (u² +v²)(u +v). So:f(x, y)= (u² +v²)(u +v) +u² +v² +uv +1.Factor out u² +v²:= (u² +v²)(u +v +1) +uv +1.Still not helpful. Maybe try to see if there's a minimum at u=0, v=0, which corresponds to x=1, y=1. Then f(1,1)=0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +1=1, which matches our previous result. So when u=0 and v=0, which corresponds to x=1, y=1, f=1. If we can show that for all u and v corresponding to x, y ≥1/2, f(x, y)≥1, then 1 is the minimum. But how?Alternatively, consider that if we can write f(x, y) as a sum of squares or something similar, then the minimum can be found. However, given the complexity of the expression, this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, consider that at the critical point (1,1), the function value is 1. All other critical points and boundaries give higher values. Therefore, 1 is the minimum.But to confirm, let's check the function at some other points in the domain. For example, take x=1, y=1: f=1. Take x=1, y=2:f(1,2)=1 +8 +2 +2 -3(1 +4 +2) +3(1 +2)=13 -3*7 +9=13 -21 +9=1.Wait, f(1,2)=1. Similarly, x=2, y=1: same result.Wait, this is interesting. So f(1,2)=1 as well. Wait, so maybe there are multiple points where f(x, y)=1?Wait, let me compute f(1,2):x=1, y=2.Compute each term:x³=1, y³=8, x²y=1*2=2, xy²=1*4=4.Then -3(x² + y² +xy)= -3(1 +4 +2)= -3*7=-21.Then +3(x + y)=3*3=9.So total:1+8+2+4 -21 +9= (1+8+2+4)+( -21 +9)=15 -12=3. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, what's wrong here.Wait, let's recalculate:x³ + y³ +x²y +xy² -3(x² +y² +xy) +3(x + y)x=1, y=2:1 +8 + (1*2) + (1*4) -3*(1 +4 +2) +3*(3)=1 +8 +2 +4 -3*7 +9=15 -21 +9=3.So f(1,2)=3, which is higher than 1. So my initial mistake was wrong.Another example: x=1.5, y=1.5. Let's compute f(1.5,1.5):x³=3.375, y³=3.375, x²y=2.25*1.5=3.375, xy²=1.5*2.25=3.375.Then -3(x² + y² +xy)= -3*(2.25 +2.25 +2.25)= -3*6.75= -20.25.Then +3(x + y)=3*3=9.Total:3.375+3.375+3.375+3.375 -20.25 +9=13.5 -20.25 +9=2.25.So f(1.5,1.5)=2.25>1.How about x=0.75, y=0.75:f(0.75,0.75)=2*(0.75)^3 +2*(0.75)^3 -3*(3*(0.75)^2) +6*(0.75)Wait, but actually, when x=y=0.75, using the previous single-variable function g(x)=4x³ -9x² +6x.So g(0.75)=4*(0.421875) -9*(0.5625) +6*(0.75)=1.6875 -5.0625 +4.5=1.125.Which is less than 1.25 at x=0.5, but still greater than 1. So (0.75,0.75) gives 1.125. Still higher than 1.Thus, so far, all computed points give f(x, y) ≥1, with the minimal value at (1,1).But wait, when we checked the critical points on the boundaries, we found a value of≈1.10185, which is higher than 1, so 1 is still lower.Therefore, according to all these calculations, the minimal value is 1, achieved at (1,1). Therefore, the answer should be 1.But let me verify once more. Let me check if the function can be written as (x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3 + something.Wait, earlier substitution gave f(x,y)= (x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3 +2 +xy(x + y -3). At (1,1), this is 0 +0 +2 +1*1*(2 -3)=2 + (-1)=1, which matches. For other points, if we can show that (x-1)^3 + (y-1)^3 +2 +xy(x + y -3) ≥1, then 1 is the minimum. But I'm not sure how to proceed.Alternatively, suppose we let a =x -1 and b=y -1, then x=1+a, y=1+b, with a ≥ -0.5, b ≥ -0.5. Substitute into f(x,y):f= (1+a)^3 + (1+b)^3 + (1+a)^2(1+b) + (1+a)(1+b)^2 -3[(1+a)^2 + (1+b)^2 + (1+a)(1+b)] +3[(1+a)+(1+b)]Expand each term:(1 +3a +3a² +a³) + (1 +3b +3b² +b³) +(1 +2a +a²)(1 +b) + (1 +a)(1 +2b +b²) -3[(1 +2a +a²) + (1 +2b +b²) + (1 +a +b +ab)] +3[2 +a +b]Expand term by term:First two terms: 2 +3a +3b +3a² +3b² +a³ +b³Third term: (1 +2a +a²)(1 +b)=1 +b +2a +2ab +a² +a²bFourth term: (1 +a)(1 +2b +b²)=1 +2b +b² +a +2ab +ab²Fifth term: -3[1 +2a +a² +1 +2b +b² +1 +a +b +ab] = -3[3 +3a +3b +a² +b² +ab] = -9 -9a -9b -3a² -3b² -3abSixth term: 3[2 +a +b]=6 +3a +3bNow combine all terms:First two terms:2 +3a +3b +3a² +3b² +a³ +b³Third term:1 +b +2a +2ab +a² +a²bFourth term:1 +2b +b² +a +2ab +ab²Fifth term:-9 -9a -9b -3a² -3b² -3abSixth term:6 +3a +3bCombine all together:Constants: 2 +1 +1 -9 +6=1a terms:3a +2a +a -9a +3a= (3+2+1-9+3)a=0b terms:3b +b +2b -9b +3b= (3+1+2-9+3)b=0a² terms:3a² +a² -3a²= (3+1-3)a²=a²b² terms:3b² +b² -3b²= (3+1-3)b²=b²ab terms:2ab +2ab -3ab= (2+2-3)ab=aba³ and b³ terms: a³ +b³Higher order terms: a²b +ab²Thus, total:f(x,y)=1 +a² +b² +ab +a³ +b³ +a²b +ab².But since a and b are ≥-0.5, how can we ensure that this is minimized at a=0,b=0?Alternatively, note that when a and b are non-negative (i.e., x≥1, y≥1), then all terms a³, b³, a²b, ab² are non-negative, so f(x,y)≥1 +a² +b² +ab≥1, with equality when a=b=0, i.e., x=1,y=1.But when a or b is negative (i.e., x<1 or y<1), the cubic terms and the quadratic terms may result in lower values. For example, if a is negative, then a³ is negative, which could decrease the value. However, in our domain, a and b can be as low as -0.5 (since x,y≥1/2). Therefore, we need to check whether the expression 1 +a² +b² +ab +a³ +b³ +a²b +ab² can be less than 1 for a,b≥-0.5.Let me see. Suppose a=-0.5, b=0. Then:f=1 +0.25 +0 +0 + (-0.125) +0 +0.25*0 +0=1 +0.25 -0.125=1.125>1.Similarly, if a=-0.5, b=-0.5:f=1 +0.25 +0.25 +0.25 + (-0.125) +(-0.125)+0.25*(-0.5)+(-0.5)*0.25=1 +0.25+0.25+0.25 -0.125 -0.125 -0.125 -0.125=1 +0.75 -0.5=1.25>1.If a=0, b=-0.5:Similar to first case: f=1.125>1.If a=-0.3, b=0:f=1 +0.09 +0 +0 + (-0.027) +0 +0.09*0 +0=1 +0.09 -0.027≈1.063>1.If a=0.5, b=0.5:f=1 +0.25 +0.25 +0.25 +0.125 +0.125 +0.25*0.5 +0.5*0.25=1 +0.25+0.25+0.25 +0.125+0.125 +0.125 +0.125=1 +0.75 +0.25 +0.25=2.25>1.Therefore, in all these test cases, f≥1. Therefore, it seems that the minimal value is indeed 1, achieved at (1,1).Thus, after thorough analysis of critical points inside the domain and on the boundaries, and checking several test points, the minimum value of f(x,y) is 1, achieved at (1,1).Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( f(x, y) ) is (boxed{1}).</think>Given the function [f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + x^2 y + xy^2 - 3(x^2 + y^2 + xy) + 3(x + y)]with ( x, y geq frac{1}{2} ), we need to find its minimum value.First, we consider the symmetry of the function by setting ( x = y ). Substituting ( x = y ) into the function, we get:[f(x, x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 6x]Taking the derivative and solving for critical points, we find:[g'(x) = 12x^2 - 18x + 6 = 0 implies 2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 implies x = 1 text{ or } x = 0.5]Evaluating ( g(x) ) at these points:[g(1) = 1 quad text{and} quad g(0.5) = 1.25]Next, we check the boundaries where ( x = frac{1}{2} ) or ( y = frac{1}{2} ). For ( x = frac{1}{2} ), the function becomes:[fleft(frac{1}{2}, yright) = y^3 - frac{5}{2}y^2 + frac{7}{4}y + frac{7}{8}]Finding critical points for this function, we get ( y = frac{7}{6} ) (approximately 1.1667) and ( y = 0.5 ). Evaluating these:[fleft(frac{1}{2}, frac{7}{6}right) approx 1.10185 quad text{and} quad fleft(frac{1}{2}, 0.5right) = 1.25]Checking the function at other critical points and boundaries, we find that the minimum value occurs at ( (1, 1) ) with ( f(1, 1) = 1 ). Thus, the minimum value of ( f(x, y) ) is (boxed{1}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of this function f(x, y) given that both x and y are at least 1/2. The function looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it or find some symmetry.First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right:f(x, y) = x³ + y³ + x² y + x y² - 3(x² + y² + x y) + 3(x + y)Hmm. Let me see. The terms seem to be a mix of cubic and quadratic terms. Maybe grouping similar terms or factoring could help.Looking at the first part: x³ + y³ + x² y + x y². I know that x³ + y³ can be factored as (x + y)(x² - x y + y²). And x² y + x y² is x y(x + y). So maybe we can factor out (x + y) from those terms.Let's try that:x³ + y³ + x² y + x y² = (x + y)(x² - x y + y²) + x y(x + y) = (x + y)(x² - x y + y² + x y) = (x + y)(x² + y²)Oh, nice! So that simplifies the first part to (x + y)(x² + y²). Then the rest of the function is subtracting 3 times (x² + y² + x y) and adding 3 times (x + y). So let's rewrite the entire function:f(x, y) = (x + y)(x² + y²) - 3(x² + y² + x y) + 3(x + y)Hmm. Let me see if I can factor or rearrange terms here. Let's expand the first term:(x + y)(x² + y²) = x³ + x y² + y x² + y³ = x³ + y³ + x² y + x y², which matches the original terms. But since I already factored that part, maybe I can combine the other terms.Let me denote A = x + y and B = x² + y². Then the first term is A * B. Then the next term is -3(B + x y). Then +3A.So f(x, y) = A B - 3(B + x y) + 3A.But not sure if this helps. Maybe expressing everything in terms of A and B?Alternatively, maybe completing the square or looking for critical points by taking partial derivatives. Since the problem is about finding the minimum with x, y ≥ 1/2, calculus might work here.But since it's a competition problem, maybe there's a smarter way without calculus. Let me check.Alternatively, maybe substitute variables. Let me set u = x + y and v = x y. Then, since x and y are variables ≥ 1/2, u and v would have some constraints. However, I need to express B = x² + y² in terms of u and v. Since x² + y² = u² - 2v.So then, f(x, y) can be written as:A * B - 3(B + v) + 3A = u (u² - 2v) - 3(u² - 2v + v) + 3uSimplify step by step:First term: u (u² - 2v) = u³ - 2u vSecond term: -3(u² - 2v + v) = -3(u² - v) = -3u² + 3vThird term: +3uPutting it all together:u³ - 2u v - 3u² + 3v + 3uHmm. Let's collect like terms:u³ - 3u² + 3u + (-2u v + 3v)Factor terms with v:= u³ - 3u² + 3u + v(-2u + 3)So f(u, v) = u³ - 3u² + 3u + v(-2u + 3)Interesting. Now, if I can express v in terms of u or find relations between u and v, maybe I can find the minimum.But since x and y are both at least 1/2, we can note that u = x + y ≥ 1 (since each is at least 1/2). Also, by AM ≥ GM, we have v = x y ≤ (u/2)^2. But since x and y are each at least 1/2, the minimum value of v would be (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 when x = y = 1/2. However, depending on u, v can vary.But how does this help? Let's see.In the expression for f(u, v), the term involving v is (-2u + 3)v. So depending on the coefficient (-2u + 3), the effect of v on f(u, v) changes.Case 1: If (-2u + 3) > 0, then to minimize f(u, v), since v is multiplied by a positive coefficient, we need to minimize v. Conversely, if (-2u + 3) < 0, we need to maximize v to minimize f(u, v). If (-2u + 3) = 0, then the term with v disappears.So let's analyze the coefficient:-2u + 3 > 0 ⇒ u < 3/2-2u + 3 < 0 ⇒ u > 3/2-2u + 3 = 0 ⇒ u = 3/2Therefore, depending on u, we have different strategies for v.Given that u = x + y ≥ 1, we need to consider u in [1, ∞). So:For u < 3/2, to minimize f(u, v), we set v as small as possible.For u > 3/2, to minimize f(u, v), we set v as large as possible.At u = 3/2, the coefficient is zero, so v doesn't affect f(u, v).Now, what's the minimum and maximum possible v given u?For fixed u, the maximum of v is achieved when x = y = u/2 (by AM ≥ GM), so v ≤ (u/2)^2.The minimum of v, given x, y ≥ 1/2 and x + y = u, is a bit trickier. Let's think.Suppose x + y = u. To minimize x y, given x, y ≥ 1/2, we need to make one variable as small as possible (1/2) and the other variable as large as possible (u - 1/2). Therefore, the minimum v for given u is (1/2)(u - 1/2).Similarly, the maximum v is (u/2)^2.So for a given u:v_min = (1/2)(u - 1/2)v_max = (u/2)^2Therefore, for u < 3/2, f(u, v) is minimized when v = v_min.For u > 3/2, f(u, v) is minimized when v = v_max.At u = 3/2, v can be anything between v_min and v_max, but the term doesn't affect f(u, v).Therefore, we can split the problem into two cases:1. u ∈ [1, 3/2): f(u, v_min) = u³ - 3u² + 3u + (-2u + 3) * (1/2)(u - 1/2)2. u ∈ [3/2, ∞): f(u, v_max) = u³ - 3u² + 3u + (-2u + 3) * (u² /4)We need to analyze both cases, find the minimum in each interval, and compare them.Let me compute each case separately.Case 1: u ∈ [1, 3/2)Compute f(u, v_min):First, expand (-2u + 3) * (1/2)(u - 1/2):Let me factor out 1/2:(1/2)(-2u + 3)(u - 1/2)Multiply out (-2u + 3)(u - 1/2):= -2u(u) + (-2u)(-1/2) + 3(u) + 3(-1/2)= -2u² + u + 3u - 3/2= -2u² + 4u - 3/2Multiply by 1/2:= (1/2)(-2u² + 4u - 3/2) = -u² + 2u - 3/4Therefore, f(u, v_min) = u³ - 3u² + 3u - u² + 2u - 3/4Combine like terms:u³ - 4u² + 5u - 3/4So f(u) = u³ - 4u² + 5u - 3/4 for u ∈ [1, 3/2)Now, find the minimum of this cubic function on [1, 1.5]Take derivative f’(u):f’(u) = 3u² - 8u + 5Set to zero:3u² - 8u + 5 = 0Compute discriminant:64 - 60 = 4Solutions:u = [8 ± 2]/6 = (10)/6 = 5/3 ≈1.6667 or (6)/6=1But u is in [1, 1.5). So critical points at u = 1 and u = 5/3 ≈1.6667, which is outside the interval [1, 1.5). Therefore, the only critical point in the interval is at u=1, but that's an endpoint. Wait, let's check.Wait, solving 3u² - 8u + 5 = 0:u = [8 ± sqrt(64 - 60)] / 6 = [8 ± 2]/6 = (8 + 2)/6 = 10/6 = 5/3 ≈1.6667 or (8 -2)/6=6/6=1. So the roots are u=1 and u=5/3. So in the interval [1, 1.5), which is up to 1.5 (which is 3/2), the critical points are u=1 and u=5/3≈1.6667. But 5/3 is approximately 1.6667, which is greater than 1.5, so outside our interval.Therefore, in [1, 1.5), the only critical point is at u=1, which is an endpoint. So we need to check the value at u=1 and the other endpoint u=1.5.Compute f(1):1³ - 4(1)² +5(1) - 3/4 = 1 -4 +5 - 0.75 = (1 -4) + (5 -0.75) = (-3) + (4.25) = 1.25 = 5/4Compute f(1.5):u = 1.5 = 3/2f(3/2) = (27/8) - 4*(9/4) +5*(3/2) - 3/4Convert all to eighths:27/8 - 4*(18/8) + 15/2 - 6/8Wait, let me compute step by step:(3/2)^3 = 27/84*(3/2)^2 = 4*(9/4) = 95*(3/2) = 15/2So:27/8 - 9 + 15/2 - 3/4Convert all to eighths:27/8 - 72/8 + 60/8 - 6/8 = (27 -72 +60 -6)/8 = (27 -72 = -45; -45 +60 =15; 15 -6=9)/8=9/8=1.125So f(3/2) =9/8=1.125Therefore, in case 1 (u ∈ [1, 1.5)), the minimum occurs at u=1.5 with value 9/8, and at u=1, it's 5/4=1.25, which is larger. Therefore, the minimum in this interval is 9/8.Case 2: u ∈ [3/2, ∞): f(u, v_max) = u³ -3u² +3u + (-2u +3)(u²/4)Let's compute this:First, expand (-2u +3)(u²/4):= (-2u * u²)/4 + (3 * u²)/4 = (-2u³)/4 + 3u²/4 = (-u³/2) + (3u²)/4Therefore, f(u) = u³ -3u² +3u -u³/2 + 3u²/4Combine like terms:u³ - u³/2 = (1/2)u³-3u² +3u²/4 = (-12u²/4 +3u²/4)= (-9u²)/4+3u remains.So f(u) = (1/2)u³ - (9/4)u² +3uSo f(u) = (1/2)u³ - (9/4)u² +3u for u ≥ 3/2Now, find the minimum of this function for u ≥3/2.Take derivative:f’(u)= (3/2)u² - (9/2)u +3Set to zero:(3/2)u² - (9/2)u +3 =0Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:3u² -9u +6=0Divide by 3:u² -3u +2=0Solutions:u=(3 ± sqrt(9 -8))/2=(3 ±1)/2 → u=2 or u=1So critical points at u=1 and u=2. But since we are considering u ≥3/2=1.5, the critical point in this interval is u=2.Therefore, check the value at u=2 and the endpoint u=3/2.Compute f(2):(1/2)(8) - (9/4)(4) +3(2)=4 -9 +6=1Compute f(3/2):u=3/2(1/2)(27/8) - (9/4)(9/4) +3*(3/2)=27/16 - 81/16 +9/2Convert 9/2 to 72/16:27/16 -81/16 +72/16=(27 -81 +72)/16=18/16=9/8=1.125So f(3/2)=9/8 and f(2)=1Also, check the behavior as u approaches infinity: leading term is (1/2)u³, which goes to infinity. So the function tends to infinity as u increases. Therefore, the minimum in this interval is at u=2 with value 1.Comparing the two cases:Case 1 (u ∈ [1, 1.5)): min 9/8 ≈1.125Case 2 (u ∈ [1.5, ∞)): min 1Therefore, the overall minimum is 1, achieved at u=2. Now, we need to verify that when u=2, x and y satisfy x, y ≥1/2 and x + y =2. Also, we set v_max=(u/2)^2= (2/2)^2=1. So x y=1. Therefore, x and y are roots of t² -2t +1=0, which is (t-1)^2=0. Therefore, x=y=1.Therefore, the minimum value is 1, achieved at (1,1).Wait, but hold on. Let me check if (1,1) is indeed in the domain x, y ≥1/2. Yes, 1≥1/2. Let's compute f(1,1):Original function:1³ +1³ +1²*1 +1*1² -3(1² +1² +1*1) +3(1 +1)=1 +1 +1 +1 -3(1 +1 +1) +3*2=4 -9 +6=1. Correct. So f(1,1)=1.But wait, the problem didn't specify that x and y are greater than or equal to 1/2, but in the problem statement it's written as \\"x, y ≥ 1/2\\". So (1,1) is valid.But just to make sure, are there other critical points? For example, when we considered case 1, where u ∈ [1,1.5), the minimum was at u=1.5 with value 9/8. But in case 2, the minimum is 1 at u=2. So 1 is smaller than 9/8 (which is 1.125). Therefore, the overall minimum is 1.But just to confirm, let's check another point. For example, if x and y are both 1/2, what is f(1/2,1/2)?Compute:(1/2)^3 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2*(1/2) + (1/2)*(1/2)^2 -3[(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)(1/2)] +3(1/2 +1/2)= 1/8 +1/8 +1/8 +1/8 -3[1/4 +1/4 +1/4] +3(1)= 4*(1/8) -3*(3/4) +3= 0.5 - 2.25 +3 =1.25Which is 5/4, which is more than 1, so not the minimum.Another test point: if x=1.5 and y=0.5, but wait, y can't be 0.5, since x + y =2 in the case of u=2. Wait, no. Wait, when u=2, x=y=1.Wait, but if I take x=1.5 and y=0.5, but y=0.5 is allowed. Wait, but in case 2, where u ≥1.5, but when we set u=2, x and y are both 1. But if we take u=2 with x=1.5 and y=0.5, then y=0.5 is allowed. Wait, but in that case, x y=0.75, but according to our previous substitution for case 2, when u ≥3/2, we set v_max=(u/2)^2, which for u=2 is 1. But x=1.5 and y=0.5 gives x y=0.75, which is less than 1. So that contradicts our earlier assumption?Wait, no. Wait, if u=2, then maximum v is (u/2)^2=1, which is achieved when x=y=1. If x and y are not equal, then x y would be less than 1. So in case 2, to get the maximum v, we need x=y= u/2. Therefore, in case 2, when we take v_max, we are assuming x=y. So when we consider the minimum for u ≥3/2, the minimum is achieved when x=y= u/2, which gives the maximum v. Therefore, when u=2, x=y=1, which is allowed. Similarly, if u=3/2, then x=y=3/4, but wait 3/4 is greater than 1/2, so that's okay. So that's valid.Therefore, in case 2, the minimal value is achieved when x=y= u/2, which is allowed since u ≥3/2, so x=y= u/2 ≥3/4 ≥1/2. Therefore, the points x=y=u/2 are in the domain.Therefore, the conclusion is that the minimal value is 1, achieved at (1,1).But just to be thorough, let's check if there are other critical points in the interior of the domain (where x,y >1/2) by using partial derivatives.Compute partial derivatives of the original function f(x, y):First, compute ∂f/∂x:∂f/∂x = 3x² + 0 + 2x y + y² - 3(2x + y) +3(1 +0)=3x² +2x y + y² -6x -3y +3Similarly, ∂f/∂y:∂f/∂y =3y² +x² +2x y -3(2y +x) +3(0 +1)=3y² +x² +2x y -6y -3x +3Set the partial derivatives to zero.So we need to solve:3x² +2x y + y² -6x -3y +3 =0 ...(1)3y² +x² +2x y -6y -3x +3 =0 ...(2)Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):[3x² +2x y + y² -6x -3y +3] - [3y² +x² +2x y -6y -3x +3] =0Simplify:3x² -x² +2x y -2x y + y² -3y² -6x +3x -3y +6y +3 -3=0=2x² -2y² -3x +3y =0Factor:2(x² - y²) -3(x - y)=0=2(x - y)(x + y) -3(x - y)=0Factor out (x - y):(x - y)[2(x + y) -3] =0Thus, either x = y or 2(x + y) -3=0 → x + y = 3/2.Case A: x = ySubstitute x=y into equation (1):3x² +2x² +x² -6x -3x +3=0=6x² -9x +3=0Divide by 3:2x² -3x +1=0Solutions:x=(3±sqrt(9-8))/4=(3±1)/4 → x=1 or x=1/2Thus, critical points at (1,1) and (1/2,1/2). But check if these are minima.Compute f(1,1)=1 as before.f(1/2,1/2)=5/4 as computed earlier.Case B: x + y =3/2Substitute y=3/2 -x into equation (1):3x² +2x(3/2 -x) + (3/2 -x)^2 -6x -3(3/2 -x) +3=0Compute term by term:3x² +3x -2x² + (9/4 -3x +x²) -6x -9/2 +3x +3=0Simplify:3x² -2x² +x² +3x -3x -6x +3x +9/4 -9/2 +3=0Combine like terms:(3x² -2x² +x²)=2x²(3x -3x -6x +3x)=(-3x)Constants:9/4 -9/2 +3=9/4 -18/4 +12/4=(9-18+12)/4=3/4Therefore:2x² -3x +3/4=0Multiply by 4 to eliminate fractions:8x² -12x +3=0Solutions:x=(12±sqrt(144-96))/16=(12±sqrt(48))/16=(12±4*sqrt(3))/16=(3±sqrt(3))/4Thus, x=(3 + sqrt(3))/4 ≈(3 +1.732)/4≈4.732/4≈1.183Or x=(3 - sqrt(3))/4≈(3 -1.732)/4≈1.268/4≈0.317But x must be ≥1/2=0.5. So x≈0.317 is less than 0.5, which is invalid. Therefore, only x≈1.183 is valid. Check if y=3/2 -x ≈1.5 -1.183≈0.317, which is less than 0.5, which is invalid. Therefore, this solution is not in the domain x,y ≥1/2. Therefore, no solutions in Case B within the domain.Thus, the only critical points in the domain are (1,1) and (1/2,1/2). But f(1,1)=1 and f(1/2,1/2)=5/4=1.25. Therefore, (1,1) is the minimum.Therefore, the minimum value is 1.But wait, earlier when we analyzed via substitution, we found that the minimum in case 2 is 1 at (1,1), which matches. And in case 1, the minimum at u=3/2 is 9/8, which is higher.Therefore, the answer is 1, achieved at (1,1).But let me confirm once more. Suppose I take another point, say x=1 and y=1.5 (but wait y=1.5 is allowed, since y≥1/2). Compute f(1,1.5):f(1,1.5)=1³ + (1.5)^3 +1²*1.5 +1*(1.5)^2 -3(1² + (1.5)^2 +1*1.5) +3(1 +1.5)Compute each term:1 + 3.375 + 1.5 + 2.25 -3(1 +2.25 +1.5) +3*2.5=1 +3.375=4.375; 4.375 +1.5=5.875; 5.875 +2.25=8.125Then -3*(4.75)= -14.25Then +7.5Total:8.125 -14.25 +7.5= (8.125 +7.5) -14.25=15.625 -14.25=1.375=11/8=1.375 which is more than 1, so indeed, higher.Another point: x=1.5, y=1.5. Then u=3, but x=1.5, y=1.5:f(1.5,1.5)=2*(1.5)^3 +2*(1.5)^3 -3*(2*(1.5)^2 + (1.5)^2) +3*(3)Wait, actually compute step by step:x³ + y³ +x² y +x y²=2*(3.375) +2*(1.5)^3. Wait, no. Let me compute:x³= (1.5)^3=3.375; same for y³=3.375x² y=(2.25)(1.5)=3.375x y²= same as x² y=3.375So sum:3.375 +3.375 +3.375 +3.375=13.5Then subtract 3(x² + y² +x y):x²=2.25, y²=2.25, x y=2.25. Sum=6.75. Multiply by3:20.25Then add3(x + y)=3*(3)=9So total f=13.5 -20.25 +9= (13.5 +9) -20.25=22.5 -20.25=2.25, which is more than1.So, yes, (1,1) gives the minimal value.Therefore, after thorough analysis via substitution and checking critical points, the minimal value is 1.Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( f(x, y) ) is boxed{1}.</think>Given the function [begin{aligned}f(x, y)= & x^{3}+y^{3}+x^{2} y+x y^{2}- & 3left(x^{2}+y^{2}+x yright)+3(x+y),end{aligned}]with ( x, y geq frac{1}{2} ), we need to find the minimum value of ( f(x, y) ).First, we rewrite the function by factoring and simplifying:[f(x, y) = (x + y)(x^2 + y^2) - 3(x^2 + y^2 + xy) + 3(x + y).]We introduce ( u = x + y ) and ( v = xy ). Then, ( x^2 + y^2 = u^2 - 2v ). Substituting these into the function, we get:[f(u, v) = u(u^2 - 2v) - 3(u^2 - 2v + v) + 3u.]Simplifying further, we have:[f(u, v) = u^3 - 3u^2 + 3u + v(-2u + 3).]We analyze the coefficient of ( v ), which is ( -2u + 3 ). For ( u < frac{3}{2} ), we minimize ( v ), and for ( u > frac{3}{2} ), we maximize ( v ). At ( u = frac{3}{2} ), the term involving ( v ) vanishes.For ( u in [1, frac{3}{2}) ), the minimum ( v ) is ( frac{1}{2}(u - frac{1}{2}) ). Substituting this, we get:[f(u) = u^3 - 4u^2 + 5u - frac{3}{4}.]Evaluating at critical points and endpoints, we find the minimum value is ( frac{9}{8} ) at ( u = frac{3}{2} ).For ( u in [frac{3}{2}, infty) ), the maximum ( v ) is ( left(frac{u}{2}right)^2 ). Substituting this, we get:[f(u) = frac{1}{2}u^3 - frac{9}{4}u^2 + 3u.]Evaluating at critical points and endpoints, we find the minimum value is ( 1 ) at ( u = 2 ).Checking the critical points using partial derivatives confirms that the minimum value is achieved at ( (1, 1) ), giving ( f(1, 1) = 1 ).Thus, the minimum value of ( f(x, y) ) is (boxed{1}).]"},{"problem":"In order to estimate the value of x-y where x and y are real numbers with x > y > 0, Xiaoli rounded x up by a small amount, rounded y down by the same amount, and then subtracted her rounded values.

So, the question is about estimating the value of x minus y, where x and y are positive real numbers with x greater than y. Xiaoli rounded x up by a small amount and rounded y down by the same amount, then subtracted the rounded values. We need to determine whether her estimate is larger, smaller, equal to the actual x - y, or something else.First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. We have two numbers, x and y, both positive, and x is bigger than y. So, x - y is a positive number. Now, Xiaoli is estimating this difference by rounding x up and y down each by the same small amount. Let's call that small amount \\"a\\", where a is a positive number. So, she replaces x with x + a, and y with y - a. Then she subtracts these two rounded numbers: (x + a) - (y - a). We need to compare this estimate to the actual value of x - y.Let me write down the original difference and the estimated difference to see the relationship. The actual difference is:Original difference: x - yXiaoli's estimate: (x + a) - (y - a) = x + a - y + a = (x - y) + 2aWait, so if you expand that subtraction, it's x + a minus y minus (-a), which simplifies to x - y + 2a. So, the estimated difference is the original difference plus twice the small amount a. Since a is a positive number (she rounded x up and y down), this means her estimate is larger than the actual difference by 2a. Therefore, her estimate is larger than x - y. So, that would make option A correct: Her estimate is larger than x - y.But let me verify this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose x is 10 and y is 5. Then x - y is 5. Now, let's say Xiaoli rounds x up by 0.1 and y down by 0.1. So, her rounded x is 10.1 and her rounded y is 4.9. Then her estimate would be 10.1 - 4.9 = 5.2. The actual difference is 5, so 5.2 is indeed larger than 5. So, in this case, the estimate is higher.Another example: Let x be 7.3 and y be 2.1. The actual difference is 7.3 - 2.1 = 5.2. Suppose she rounds x up by 0.05 and y down by 0.05. So, x becomes 7.35 and y becomes 2.05. The estimate is 7.35 - 2.05 = 5.3, which is again larger than 5.2. So, in both examples, the estimate is higher. So, that seems to confirm the initial conclusion.But wait, let me check if this holds for all cases. Suppose x is just barely larger than y. For example, x = 3.1, y = 3.0. The actual difference is 0.1. If she rounds x up by 0.01, making it 3.11, and rounds y down by 0.01, making it 2.99. Then her estimate is 3.11 - 2.99 = 0.12, which is still larger than 0.1. So again, the estimate is larger. Alternatively, take x and y as integers. Let x = 100, y = 50. Then x - y = 50. Rounding x up by 1 and y down by 1 gives 101 - 49 = 52, which is 2 more than the actual difference. So, again, the estimate is larger by twice the rounding amount. So, in all these examples, the estimated difference is larger than the actual difference. Therefore, the answer should be option A: Her estimate is larger than x - y. Wait, but just to be thorough, is there a scenario where this might not hold? For instance, if a is not a positive number, but the problem states that she rounds x up and y down by the same amount, so a must be positive. Also, if rounding down y by a makes y - a negative, but the problem says y > 0, so as long as a is less than y, y - a remains positive. However, even if a is larger than y, making y - a negative, does that affect the conclusion? Let's test that.Suppose y is 1, and a is 2. So, y - a = -1. Then if x is, say, 3. Original difference is 2. Rounded x is 3 + 2 = 5, rounded y is -1. Then the estimate is 5 - (-1) = 6. Which is 6 versus the original 2. Still, 6 is larger than 2. So, even in this case, the estimate is larger. So, regardless of the size of a, even if y - a becomes negative, as long as x is rounded up and y is rounded down by a, the estimate (x + a) - (y - a) = x - y + 2a, which is still larger than x - y.Therefore, regardless of how much a is, as long as a is a positive number, the estimate will always be larger than the actual difference. Thus, statement A is necessarily correct. So, the answer should be A.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>Xiaoli needs to estimate the value of ( x - y ) where ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers with ( x > y > 0 ). She rounded ( x ) up by a small amount ( a ) and rounded ( y ) down by the same amount ( a ), then subtracted the rounded values. The original difference is:[x - y]Xiaoli's estimate is calculated as:[(x + a) - (y - a)]Expanding this expression, we get:[(x + a) - (y - a) = x + a - y + a = (x - y) + 2a]Since ( a ) is a positive number, the term ( 2a ) is added to the original difference ( x - y ). This means Xiaoli's estimate is larger than the actual value ( x - y ).Testing with various examples confirms that the estimate is always larger than the actual difference, regardless of the value of ( a ). Therefore, the correct answer is:[boxed{A}],<think>Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Xiaoli wants to estimate the value of x minus y, where x and y are real numbers with x greater than y and both are positive. The way she did it is by rounding up x by a small amount, let's say that amount is called \\"a\\". Then she rounded down y by the same amount \\"a\\", and then subtracted the rounded values. The question is asking which statement is necessarily correct about her estimate compared to the actual value of x - y. The options are whether her estimate is larger, smaller, equal to x - y, or if it's zero. Hmm.Let me break it down step by step. Let's denote the small amount she rounded by as \\"a\\", where a is a positive real number. So, if she rounds up x by a, her new x value would be x + a. Similarly, rounding down y by a would make the new y value y - a. Then she subtracts these two rounded numbers: (x + a) - (y - a). Let's compute that.Original difference: x - y.Xiaoli's estimated difference: (x + a) - (y - a) = x + a - y + a = x - y + 2a.So, her estimate is x - y + 2a. Now, since a is a positive number (she rounded up x and rounded down y by the same amount), 2a is also positive. Therefore, her estimate is equal to the original difference plus 2a. That means her estimate is larger than the actual value x - y.Looking at the options, option A says \\"Her estimate is larger than x - y\\", which seems to be the case here. Option B says it's smaller, which is not true. Options C and D say her estimate equals x - y, which isn't correct because we added 2a. Option E says her estimate is zero, which is only possible if x - y + 2a = 0, but since x > y > 0 and a is positive, that can't happen. So, E is out.Therefore, the correct answer should be A. Let me verify once again. If you increase the minuend (x) and decrease the subtrahend (y), both actions would contribute to increasing the result of the subtraction. For example, suppose x is 5 and y is 3, so x - y is 2. If you round up x by 1, it becomes 6, and round down y by 1, it becomes 2. Then the estimate is 6 - 2 = 4, which is indeed larger than 2. The difference here is 2a, which in this case was 2*1=2, so the estimate was 4. That makes sense. So definitely, the estimate is larger. Therefore, A is correct.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>Xiaoli rounded ( x ) up by a small amount ( a ) and rounded ( y ) down by the same amount ( a ). The original difference is ( x - y ). Her estimated difference is calculated as follows:[text{Estimated difference} = (x + a) - (y - a)]Simplifying this expression:[(x + a) - (y - a) = x + a - y + a = x - y + 2a]Since ( a ) is a positive amount, ( 2a ) is also positive. Therefore, her estimate ( x - y + 2a ) is larger than the actual value ( x - y ).The correct answer is (boxed{A}).]"},{"problem":"3.

The third column has 2, 2, missing, 3, 3.I need to find the rule that connects the first number to the second and third numbers in each row. Let's look at the first two rows where all numbers are present.First row: 9, 81, 2. Let's see. If I square 9, that's 81. But then why is there a 2 in the third column? Wait, 9 squared is 81, and maybe 9 to the power of 2 is 81? But 9^2 is indeed 81. So the third column could be the exponent, and the second column is the first number raised to that exponent. Let's check the second row: 16, 256, 2. If 16 squared is 256, yes. So 16^2 = 256. That matches. So maybe the third column is the exponent, and the second column is the first number raised to that exponent.Third row: 11, 11, missing. If the second number is 11, then 11 raised to what exponent gives 11? That would be 1. Because any number to the power of 1 is itself. So maybe the missing third number is 1. Let's check if that makes sense.Fourth row: 6, 216, 3. Let's compute 6^3. 6*6=36, 36*6=216. Yes, that works. So 6 cubed is 216, so third column is 3.Fifth row: 5, missing, 3. So if the third column is 3, then the second number should be 5^3, which is 125. So the missing number there would be 125.Wait, but let's check the third row again. If the first number is 11, and the second number is 11, then 11^1 = 11, so the third column would be 1. That seems consistent.So the rule seems to be that the second column is the first column number raised to the power of the third column number. So, for each row: Column2 = Column1 ^ Column3.Therefore, in the third row, since Column2 is 11 and Column1 is 11, Column3 must be 1. In the fifth row, Column1 is 5 and Column3 is 3, so Column2 should be 5^3 = 125.Let me verify with all rows again to make sure there's no exception.First row: 9^2 = 81 ✔️Second row: 16^2 = 256 ✔️Third row: 11^1 = 11 ✔️ (if we fill in 1)Fourth row: 6^3 = 216 ✔️Fifth row: 5^3 = 125 ✔️ (so fill in 125)That seems to hold. Let me check if there could be another pattern, just to be sure.Alternative idea: Maybe the third column is the number of digits in the second column? Let's see. For first row, 81 has two digits, third column is 2. Second row, 256 has three digits, but third column is 2. Doesn't match. So that doesn't work.Another thought: Maybe the third column is related to the difference between first and second numbers? For example, 81 - 9 = 72, but third column is 2. Not sure. 256 -16 = 240, third column is 2. Doesn't seem related.Alternatively, multiplication: 9 * 9 = 81, which is squared, so exponent 2. Similarly, 16*16=256, which is squared, exponent 2. 11*1 =11, so exponent 1. 6*6*6=216, exponent 3. 5*5*5=125, exponent 3. So that fits. So the third column is the exponent applied to the first number to get the second number.Therefore, the missing numbers are:Third row: third column is 1, because 11^1 =11.Fifth row: second column is 5^3=125.That seems consistent. Let me check once more for any possible inconsistencies or alternative patterns.Wait, the third row: first number is 11, second is 11. If we think of exponents, 11^1=11. So exponent is 1. If we think of roots, maybe? For example, if column2 is column1 multiplied by something. But that seems less straightforward.Alternatively, if column3 is the root. For example, 81 is 9 squared, so square root of 81 is 9, but column3 is 2. So maybe the root degree? That would be the same as the exponent. Since the nth root of x is x^(1/n). So if column2 = column1^n, then column1 is the nth root of column2. So column3 is n. So that's consistent.Another angle: Maybe column3 is the number of digits in column1? 9 is one digit, but column3 is 2. 16 is two digits, column3 is 2. 11 is two digits, but column3 is 1. Doesn't match. So no.Alternatively, column3 is the sum of digits of column1. For 9: sum 9, which is 9, but column3 is 2. Doesn't fit. 16: 1+6=7, column3 is 2. Doesn't fit.Alternatively, maybe column3 is the result of some operation between column1 and column2. For example, column3 = log_column1(column2). Since log_9(81) = 2, because 9^2=81. log_16(256)= log_16(16^2)=2. log_11(11)=1. log_6(216)= log_6(6^3)=3. log_5(125)= log_5(5^3)=3. So yes, column3 is the logarithm base column1 of column2. That's another way to express the same relationship. So if column2 = column1 ^ column3, then column3 = log_column1(column2). That checks out.Therefore, the rule is column3 is the exponent you need to raise column1 to get column2. Therefore, for the third row, since column2 is 11 and column1 is 11, exponent is 1. For the fifth row, column1 is 5 and column3 is 3, so column2 is 5^3=125.Therefore, the missing numbers are 1 in the third row's third column and 125 in the fifth row's second column.Final AnswerThe missing numbers are 1 and 125. The completed table is:| 9 | 81 | 2 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 16 | 256 | 2 || 11 | 11 | boxed{1} || 6 | 216 | 3 || 5 | boxed{125} | 3 |</think>The rule for constructing the table is that the second column is the first column number raised to the power of the third column number (i.e., Column2 = Column1 ^ Column3). - For the third row: The first number is 11 and the second number is 11. Since 11 raised to the power of 1 is 11, the missing third column number is 1.- For the fifth row: The first number is 5 and the third column number is 3. Therefore, the second column number is 5 cubed, which is 125.The completed table is:| 9 | 81 | 2 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 16 | 256 | 2 || 11 | 11 | boxed{1} || 6 | 216 | 3 || 5 | boxed{125} | 3 |,<think>Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the rule that connects the numbers in each row of this table. The table has three columns, and some entries are missing. Let me start by looking at the existing numbers and see if I can spot any patterns or relationships between them.First, let's list out the rows with all numbers present:1. 9 | 81 | 22. 16 | 256 | 23. 11 | 11 | ?4. 6 | 216 | 35. 5 | ? | 3So, the first row has 9, 81, 2. The second is 16, 256, 2. The fourth is 6, 216, 3. The third and fifth are missing numbers. Let's analyze the complete rows first.Looking at the first row: 9, 81, 2. Maybe the second number is related to the first and third? Let's see: 9 and 2 somehow leading to 81. Hmm, 9 squared is 81, but then what's the role of the third column, which is 2 here? Maybe the exponent? 9 squared is 81, so if the third column is the exponent, that would make sense: 9^2 = 81. Then the third column is the exponent used on the first number to get the second number. Let's check the second row: 16, 256, 2. 16 squared is 256. Yes, that works. 16^2 = 256. So the third column is the exponent. Then the fourth row: 6, 216, 3. 6 cubed is 216. 6^3 = 216. Correct. So this seems to be the pattern: the second number is the first number raised to the power of the third number. So the formula would be: Column2 = Column1 ^ Column3.If that's the case, let's test the third row: 11, 11, ?. So if Column2 is 11, which is supposed to be Column1 (11) raised to Column3. So 11^x = 11. Therefore, x must be 1, because any number to the first power is itself. So the missing third column in the third row should be 1. Let me verify that. 11^1 = 11. Yep, that works.Then the fifth row: 5, ?, 3. So Column2 should be 5^3. 5^3 is 125. So the missing number in the second column of the fifth row should be 125. Let me check if there's any inconsistency with this rule.Looking back at the third row: applying the rule, 11^1 = 11, which fits. The first row: 9^2=81, second row:16^2=256, fourth row:6^3=216, fifth row:5^3=125. All of these make sense. Is there any other possible pattern?Wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another way. For example, maybe the third column is not the exponent but something else. Let's see. Let's check if there's a different relationship. For the first row, 9 to 81 is multiplying by 9, but 9*9=81. The third column is 2. Maybe the multiplier is 9, but how does 2 relate? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 9 times 9 is 81, which is 9 squared. So exponent 2. Similarly, 16 times 16 is 256, which is 16 squared. 6 times 6 times 6 is 216, which is 6 cubed. So that still points to the third column being the exponent.Another angle: maybe Column1 multiplied by Column3 gives part of the result. For the first row: 9*2=18, but 81 isn't 18. Second row:16*2=32, 256 is not 32. Fourth row:6*3=18, 216 isn't 18. So that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, Column1 plus Column3: 9+2=11, but 81 isn't related. Not helpful.Alternatively, Column2 divided by Column1: 81/9=9, which is 9 again. 256/16=16. 216/6=36. Wait, 9 is 9^1, 16 is 16^1, 36 is 6^2. Hmm, maybe not a clear pattern here. Wait, 81 is 9^2, 256 is 16^2, 216 is 6^3, so maybe the exponents are 2,2,3, etc., as in the third column. Which matches the third column numbers: 2,2,3. Wait, but the third column in the first row is 2, which is the exponent. So yes, seems like exponent.So if the rule is Column2 = Column1 ^ Column3, then:Third row: 11, 11, ?. 11^x = 11. Therefore, x=1.Fifth row:5, ?, 3. 5^3=125.Therefore, the missing numbers are 1 and 125.But let me check again. Maybe there's an exception or another layer. For instance, in the third row, the first and second columns are both 11. If Column3 is 1, then 11^1=11, which is correct. So that fits. The fifth row, 5^3=125, which would be the missing number.Is there any other possible pattern? Let's consider if the third column is the number of digits or something else. For the first row, 81 has two digits, but the third column is 2. Hmm, 81 is two digits. Second row:256 has three digits, but the third column is 2. Doesn't match. Fourth row:216 has three digits, third column is 3. Fifth row: if the missing number is 125, which has three digits, and the third column is 3. Wait, that actually matches. Wait, 216 is three digits and third column is 3. 125 is three digits, third column is 3. Then maybe the third column is the number of digits in the second column? Let's check the other rows. First row:81 has two digits, third column is 2. Second row:256 has three digits, but third column is 2. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, that theory is invalid because in the second row, 256 has three digits but the third column is 2. So that's inconsistent.Alternatively, maybe the third column is the number of letters in the spelled-out version of the second column? For example, 81 is \\"eighty-one\\" which has 10 letters. That seems too complicated. Probably not. The initial exponent idea seems more straightforward and consistent with all rows except maybe the second row. Wait, no. 16^2=256, which is correct. 256 has three digits, but the exponent is 2. So maybe that's a coincidence in the fourth and fifth rows. The fourth row:216 has three digits, exponent is 3. Fifth row:125 has three digits, exponent is 3. But in the first and second rows, the exponents are 2, and the second columns have two and three digits, respectively. So it's inconsistent. Therefore, the exponent rule is more reliable because it's mathematical and holds for all rows.So I think the rule is indeed Column2 = Column1 raised to the power of Column3. Therefore:Third row: 11 (Column1), 11 (Column2). So Column3 must be 1, since 11^1 = 11.Fifth row:5 (Column1), ?, 3 (Column3). Therefore, Column2 is 5^3 = 125.Therefore, the missing numbers are 1 in the third row's third column, and 125 in the fifth row's second column.I don't see any contradictions with this rule. Let me double-check each row:1. 9^2 = 81 ✔️2. 16^2 = 256 ✔️3. 11^1 = 11 ✔️4. 6^3 = 216 ✔️5. 5^3 = 125 ✔️Yes, all correct. So the rule holds for all rows. Therefore, the missing numbers are 1 and 125.</think>The table is constructed such that the second column is the result of raising the first column's number to the power of the third column's number. Applying this rule:- For the third row: (11^1 = 11), so the missing third column is (1).- For the fifth row: (5^3 = 125), so the missing second column is (125).| 9 | 81 | 2 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 16 | 256 | 2 || 11 | 11 | boxed{1} || 6 | 216 | 3 || 5 | boxed{125} | 3 |]"},{"problem":"Let's find the coefficient of (x^4) in the productleft(1-2 x+4 x^{2}-8 x^{3}+16 x^{4}right) cdotleft(1+2 x+4 x^{2}+8 x^{3}+16 x^{4}right)","solution":"By multiplying the appropriate terms, we find that the sought coefficient is 16.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of (x^4) in the product of these two polynomials: ((1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)) and ((1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)). Hmm, let's see. I remember that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a particular term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to that term. So for (x^4), I need to find all pairs of terms from the first and second polynomials where the exponents add up to 4. Then multiply their coefficients and add them all together. Let me write down the polynomials again for clarity:First polynomial (let's call it P1): (1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)Second polynomial (P2): (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)So, each term in P1 will be multiplied by each term in P2, and I need to collect all the products that result in an (x^4) term. The exponents in P1 are from 0 to 4, and same for P2. So the possible pairs (i, j) such that i + j = 4. Let me list them:i (from P1) can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Then j (from P2) should be 4 - i. So:- When i = 0, j = 4: Multiply the constant term from P1 by the (x^4) term in P2.- When i = 1, j = 3: Multiply the (-2x) term by the (8x^3) term.- When i = 2, j = 2: Multiply the (4x^2) term by the (4x^2) term.- When i = 3, j = 1: Multiply the (-8x^3) term by the (2x) term.- When i = 4, j = 0: Multiply the (16x^4) term by the constant term in P2.Okay, so those are all the pairs. Now let's find their coefficients and compute the products:1. For i=0, j=4: The coefficient in P1 for x^0 is 1, and in P2 for x^4 is 16. So 1 * 16 = 16.2. For i=1, j=3: The coefficient of x^1 in P1 is -2, and in P2 for x^3 is 8. So -2 * 8 = -16.3. For i=2, j=2: The coefficient of x^2 in P1 is 4, and in P2 it's 4. So 4 * 4 = 16.4. For i=3, j=1: The coefficient of x^3 in P1 is -8, and in P2 for x^1 is 2. So -8 * 2 = -16.5. For i=4, j=0: The coefficient of x^4 in P1 is 16, and in P2 for x^0 is 1. So 16 * 1 = 16.Now, adding all these up: 16 + (-16) + 16 + (-16) + 16.Let me compute step by step:16 - 16 = 00 + 16 = 1616 -16 = 00 +16 = 16.So total coefficient is 16.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each term to make sure I didn't make a mistake in signs or coefficients.First term: 1 * 16 = 16. Correct.Second term: (-2) * 8 = -16. Correct.Third term: 4 * 4 = 16. Correct.Fourth term: (-8) * 2 = -16. Correct.Fifth term: 16 * 1 = 16. Correct.Adding them: 16 -16 +16 -16 +16.Yes, 16 -16 is 0, then +16 -16 is 0 again, then +16. So total 16.Wait, but is that right? Let me check again. Maybe there's another way to verify this.Alternatively, maybe multiply the two polynomials and see. But multiplying all terms would take time, but maybe since they are finite, with terms up to x^4, maybe multiplying them would give up to x^8. But maybe I can just compute the coefficient for x^4. Wait, but that's what I already did. Alternatively, maybe notice a pattern in the polynomials.Looking at the polynomials, they look like finite geometric series. The first one is 1 - 2x + 4x^2 -8x^3 +16x^4, which is like (-2x)^0 + (-2x)^1 + ... + (-2x)^4. Similarly, the second one is 1 + 2x + 4x^2 +8x^3 +16x^4, which is (2x)^0 + (2x)^1 + ... + (2x)^4. So they are both geometric series with ratio -2x and 2x, respectively, each with 5 terms (from exponent 0 to 4). So the product would be [(1 - (-2x)^5)/(1 - (-2x))] * [(1 - (2x)^5)/(1 - 2x)]. Wait, but maybe that's more complicated.Alternatively, since these are finite geometric series, their product is (1 - (-2x)^5)/(1 + 2x) * (1 - (2x)^5)/(1 - 2x). Wait, but that seems messy. Alternatively, since (1 + 2x + 4x^2 +8x^3 +16x^4) is (1 - (2x)^5)/(1 - 2x), and (1 -2x +4x^2 -8x^3 +16x^4) is (1 - (-2x)^5)/(1 + 2x). So if we multiply them together, it would be [1 - (-2x)^5][1 - (2x)^5] / [(1 + 2x)(1 - 2x)] = [1 - (-32x^5) - (32x^5) + ( -2x)^5*(2x)^5 ] / (1 - (2x)^2). Wait, but simplifying numerator:Wait, [1 - (-2x)^5][1 - (2x)^5] = 1 - (2x)^5 - (-2x)^5 + (-2x)^5*(2x)^5.But (-2x)^5 is -32x^5, and (2x)^5 is 32x^5. So:1 -32x^5 - (-32x^5) + (-32x^5)(32x^5) = 1 -32x^5 +32x^5 -1024x^{10} = 1 -1024x^{10}.Denominator: (1 +2x)(1 -2x) =1 -4x^2.So the product is (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2).But this is equal to (1/(1 -4x^2)) - (1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2).But 1/(1 -4x^2) is the generating function for the series 1 +4x^2 +16x^4 +64x^6 +... So the coefficient of x^4 in 1/(1 -4x^2) is 16, as 4^2. Then the second term is -1024x^{10}/(1 -4x^2). But x^{10} multiplied by the series 1 +4x^2 +16x^4 +... would start contributing from x^10, so for x^4 term, this part doesn't contribute. Therefore, the coefficient of x^4 in the entire product is 16.Wait, that's the same as what I calculated earlier! So the coefficient is 16. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct. So the answer is 16.But just to be thorough, let's try multiplying the two polynomials step by step up to x^4. Let's see:Multiply each term of P1 with each term of P2 and collect the coefficients for x^4.But since both polynomials are up to x^4, when multiplying, the x^4 term comes from:As before:1*16x^4 =16x^4(-2x)*(8x^3)= -16x^44x^2*(4x^2)=16x^4(-8x^3)*(2x)= -16x^416x^4*1=16x^4Adding those: 16 -16 +16 -16 +16 =16. Yep, same result.Therefore, the coefficient is 16. So I think that's the correct answer.Final AnswerThe coefficient of (x^4) is boxed{16}.</think>To find the coefficient of (x^4) in the product of the polynomials ((1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)) and ((1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)), we need to consider all pairs of terms from each polynomial whose exponents add up to 4. The pairs of terms and their coefficients are:1. The constant term (1) from the first polynomial multiplied by the (x^4) term (16) from the second polynomial: (1 cdot 16 = 16).2. The (-2x) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the (8x^3) term from the second polynomial: (-2 cdot 8 = -16).3. The (4x^2) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the (4x^2) term from the second polynomial: (4 cdot 4 = 16).4. The (-8x^3) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the (2x) term from the second polynomial: (-8 cdot 2 = -16).5. The (16x^4) term from the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term (1) from the second polynomial: (16 cdot 1 = 16).Adding these products together:[16 + (-16) + 16 + (-16) + 16 = 16 - 16 + 16 - 16 + 16 = 16]Thus, the coefficient of (x^4) in the product is (boxed{16}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of (x^4) in the product of these two polynomials: ((1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)) and ((1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)). Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term, like (x^4), is found by multiplying pairs of terms from each polynomial whose exponents add up to 4. Then, you sum all those products. So, for each term in the first polynomial, I need to find the corresponding term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied together, give an (x^4) term. Let me write down the two polynomials for clarity:First polynomial (P1): (1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)Second polynomial (P2): (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)I need to find all combinations where the exponents from P1 and P2 add up to 4. Let's list the terms in P1 and their exponents:- Term 1: (1) (which is (x^0))- Term 2: (-2x) (which is (x^1))- Term 3: (4x^2) (which is (x^2))- Term 4: (-8x^3) (which is (x^3))- Term 5: (16x^4) (which is (x^4))Similarly, for P2:- Term 1: (1) (which is (x^0))- Term 2: (2x) (which is (x^1))- Term 3: (4x^2) (which is (x^2))- Term 4: (8x^3) (which is (x^3))- Term 5: (16x^4) (which is (x^4))Now, to get (x^4), the exponents from P1 and P2 should add up to 4. So possible pairs are:- (x^0) (from P1) * (x^4) (from P2)- (x^1) (from P1) * (x^3) (from P2)- (x^2) (from P1) * (x^2) (from P2)- (x^3) (from P1) * (x^1) (from P2)- (x^4) (from P1) * (x^0) (from P2)So, these are the five pairs I need to consider. Let me compute each product and then add them up.1. (x^0) from P1 is 1, and (x^4) from P2 is (16x^4). So, multiplying these gives: (1 * 16x^4 = 16x^4).2. (x^1) from P1 is (-2x), and (x^3) from P2 is (8x^3). Multiplying these: (-2x * 8x^3 = -16x^4).3. (x^2) from P1 is (4x^2), and (x^2) from P2 is (4x^2). Multiplying these: (4x^2 * 4x^2 = 16x^4).4. (x^3) from P1 is (-8x^3), and (x^1) from P2 is (2x). Multiplying these: (-8x^3 * 2x = -16x^4).5. (x^4) from P1 is (16x^4), and (x^0) from P2 is 1. Multiplying these: (16x^4 * 1 = 16x^4).Now, let's sum all these coefficients:16 (from first term) + (-16) (from second term) + 16 (from third term) + (-16) (from fourth term) + 16 (from fifth term).Calculating step by step:16 - 16 = 00 + 16 = 1616 -16 = 00 +16 =16So, the total coefficient is 16? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, the terms are:16, -16, 16, -16, 16.So adding them:16 + (-16) = 00 +16 =1616 + (-16)=00 +16=16Yes, so total is 16. Hmm, but let me double-check each multiplication step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First term: 1 *16x^4=16x^4. Correct.Second term: (-2x)*(8x^3) = -16x^4. Correct.Third term:4x^2 *4x^2=16x^4. Correct.Fourth term: (-8x^3)*(2x)= -16x^4. Correct.Fifth term:16x^4 *1=16x^4. Correct.So all coefficients are correct. Then adding them up: 16 -16 +16 -16 +16.Grouping them as (16 -16) + (16 -16) +16.Which is 0 +0 +16=16. So the coefficient is 16. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Wait, but maybe I need to check if there are more terms? Wait, does each polynomial have up to x^4? So when multiplying, for x^4 term, all combinations where exponents sum to 4. Since the polynomials have terms up to x^4, those are all possible combinations. So yes, those five terms. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this product. Let me see. The two polynomials look like geometric series. The first one is 1 -2x +4x^2 -8x^3 +16x^4. That's like a geometric sequence with ratio -2x: 1 + (-2x) + (-2x)^2 + (-2x)^3 + (-2x)^4. Similarly, the second polynomial is 1 +2x +4x^2 +8x^3 +16x^4, which is a geometric series with ratio 2x: 1 +2x + (2x)^2 + (2x)^3 + (2x)^4. So both are finite geometric series with 5 terms each. If that's the case, maybe we can use the formula for the product of geometric series. The product of (1 - ar) and (1 + ar) is 1 - (ar)^2, but here both have five terms. Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let me see. The first polynomial is 1 + (-2x) + (-2x)^2 + (-2x)^3 + (-2x)^4. The sum of a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio -2x for 5 terms is [1 - (-2x)^5]/[1 - (-2x)]. Similarly, the second polynomial is [1 - (2x)^5]/[1 - 2x]. Therefore, the product of the two polynomials would be [1 - (-2x)^5][1 - (2x)^5] / [(1 - (-2x))(1 - 2x)]. Let me check that. Wait, actually, the first polynomial is the sum from k=0 to 4 of (-2x)^k, which is [1 - (-2x)^5]/[1 - (-2x)], and the second polynomial is the sum from k=0 to 4 of (2x)^k, which is [1 - (2x)^5]/[1 - 2x]. Therefore, the product is [1 - (-32x^5)][1 - 32x^5] / [(1 + 2x)(1 - 2x)]. Simplifying the denominator: (1 + 2x)(1 - 2x) = 1 - (2x)^2 = 1 -4x^2. So the product is [1 - (-32x^5)][1 - 32x^5]/(1 -4x^2). Let me compute the numerator:[1 - (-32x^5)][1 - 32x^5] = (1 +32x^5)(1 -32x^5) = 1 - (32x^5)^2 =1 -1024x^{10}. Therefore, the entire product is (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2). Hmm, so the product of the two polynomials is (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2). Now, 1/(1 -4x^2) is a generating function that can be expressed as a power series: sum_{n=0}^infty (4x^2)^n = sum_{n=0}^infty 4^n x^{2n}. However, since we have a finite product, but here the original polynomials had degree 4, but after expansion, the product would have degree 8. Wait, but in the expression (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2), if we expand it as (1 -1024x^{10}) * sum_{n=0}^infty 4^n x^{2n}, then this would be an infinite series, but the original product is a polynomial of degree 8, so actually the terms beyond x^8 would cancel out with the -1024x^{10} term. Hmm, maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, since we already have the product expressed as (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x^2), but we need to represent it as a polynomial up to x^8, because the original product is (degree 4) * (degree 4) = degree 8. Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't the easiest way. Maybe going back to the original method of multiplying each term is better. But since I already calculated the coefficient as 16, maybe I should verify with another method. Let's try expanding the product up to x^4 terms. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding the coefficients. Let me recount them:1. 1 *16x^4 =16x^42. (-2x) *8x^3= -16x^43.4x^2 *4x^2=16x^44. (-8x^3)*2x= -16x^45.16x^4 *1=16x^4So coefficients: 16, -16,16,-16,16. Adding them: 16 -16 is 0, plus 16 is 16, minus16 is 0, plus16 is16. So yes, 16. Wait, but when I first saw the two polynomials, the first is alternating signs with powers of 2 coefficients, and the second is all positive with powers of 2 coefficients. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see, for the coefficient of x^4, perhaps there's a symmetry.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but here it's not exactly like that because the terms are not symmetric. The first polynomial is 1 -2x +4x² -8x³ +16x⁴, and the second is 1 +2x +4x² +8x³ +16x⁴. So if I let the first polynomial be P(x) = sum_{k=0}^4 (-2x)^k, and the second polynomial be Q(x) = sum_{k=0}^4 (2x)^k. Then, P(x) = [1 - (-2x)^5]/[1 +2x], and Q(x) = [1 - (2x)^5]/[1 -2x]. Therefore, P(x)*Q(x) = [1 - (-2x)^5][1 - (2x)^5]/[(1 +2x)(1 -2x)] = [1 - (-32x^5)][1 -32x^5]/(1 -4x²) = [1 - (32x^5)^2]/(1 -4x²) = (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x²). But the product of P(x) and Q(x) is (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x²). To find the coefficient of x^4 in this expression, we can consider expanding 1/(1 -4x²) as a power series. Since 1/(1 -4x²) = sum_{n=0}^infty (4x²)^n = 1 +4x² +16x⁴ +64x⁶ +256x⁸ +... Then, multiplying by (1 -1024x^{10}), the product becomes (1 +4x² +16x⁴ +64x⁶ +256x⁸ +...) -1024x^{10}(1 +4x² +16x⁴ +...). However, we only care about the coefficient of x⁴. In the first part, the coefficient of x⁴ is 16. In the second part, the term -1024x^{10} multiplied by the series will only contribute to x^{10} and higher terms, which we can ignore for x⁴. Therefore, the coefficient of x⁴ is 16. This matches my previous result. So both methods give 16. Therefore, the coefficient of x⁴ in the product is 16. Wait a second, but hold on. The original polynomials are each of degree 4. When multiplied, the product should be a polynomial of degree 8. However, in the expression (1 -1024x^{10})/(1 -4x²), which is equivalent to the product, if we expand this as a power series, it would technically be an infinite series, but multiplied by (1 -1024x^{10}), which subtracts 1024x^{10} times the same series. However, since the original product is a finite polynomial, this suggests that beyond degree 8, the terms would cancel out. However, when considering the coefficient of x⁴, we don't need to worry about higher degree terms. Therefore, using the generating function approach, the coefficient of x⁴ is indeed 16. So both methods confirm that the coefficient is 16. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 16. But just to be absolutely sure, let's do a small part of the multiplication manually. Let's multiply the two polynomials term by term up to x⁴. Let me write down the product:(1)(1) =1(1)(2x) + (-2x)(1) =2x -2x=0(1)(4x²) + (-2x)(2x) + (4x²)(1)=4x² -4x² +4x²=4x²Wait, but this is for the coefficient of x². Wait, maybe I should do the entire multiplication up to x⁴. To compute the coefficient of x⁴, we need all pairs of terms from P1 and P2 where the exponents add up to 4. As we listed earlier:- P1's x⁰ * P2's x⁴: 1*16x⁴=16x⁴- P1's x¹ * P2's x³: (-2x)*(8x³)=-16x⁴- P1's x² * P2's x²: (4x²)*(4x²)=16x⁴- P1's x³ * P2's x¹: (-8x³)*(2x)=-16x⁴- P1's x⁴ * P2's x⁰: 16x⁴*1=16x⁴Adding these up: 16 -16 +16 -16 +16=16. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in sign somewhere. Let me check each term again:1. 1 * 16x⁴: positive 16.2. (-2x) *8x³: -2*8= -16, correct.3.4x² *4x²:4*4=16, correct.4. (-8x³)*2x: -8*2=-16, correct.5.16x⁴*1=16, correct.No sign errors here. So adding them up, as before: 16-16=0; 0+16=16; 16-16=0; 0+16=16. Therefore, the coefficient is 16. Alternatively, maybe I can multiply the two polynomials completely and check. Let's see. Multiply (1 -2x +4x² -8x³ +16x⁴) by (1 +2x +4x² +8x³ +16x⁴). But this might take a while, but let's attempt it up to x⁴ terms. The full expansion would be:1*(1) +1*(2x) +1*(4x²) +1*(8x³) +1*(16x⁴)-2x*(1) -2x*(2x) -2x*(4x²) -2x*(8x³) -2x*(16x⁴)+4x²*(1) +4x²*(2x) +4x²*(4x²) +4x²*(8x³) +4x²*(16x⁴)-8x³*(1) -8x³*(2x) -8x³*(4x²) -8x³*(8x³) -8x³*(16x⁴)+16x⁴*(1) +16x⁴*(2x) +16x⁴*(4x²) +16x⁴*(8x³) +16x⁴*(16x⁴)But this is very tedious. However, to find the x⁴ term, we can collect all terms where the exponents add to 4, as we did before. So we have already computed that. But let's see if there are more terms contributing to x⁴. Wait, no. Each term in P1 multiplies each term in P2, but only when their exponents sum to 4. So for example, the term 1*16x⁴, -2x*8x³, etc. Therefore, the coefficient is 16 as calculated. Alternatively, if I use a table to compute the products:Let me list the coefficients of each polynomial:P1: [1, -2, 4, -8, 16] for degrees 0 to 4.P2: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] for degrees 0 to 4.The product's coefficient for x⁴ is the sum over all i + j =4 of P1[i] * P2[j].So indices i and j from 0 to4 such that i +j=4.Possible pairs (i,j):(0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)Thus:P1[0]*P2[4] =1*16=16P1[1]*P2[3]=(-2)*8=-16P1[2]*P2[2]=4*4=16P1[3]*P2[1]=(-8)*2=-16P1[4]*P2[0]=16*1=16Adding them: 16 -16 +16 -16 +16=16. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the coefficient is 16. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{16}Final Answerboxed{16}</think>To find the coefficient of (x^4) in the product of the polynomials ((1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)) and ((1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)), we need to consider the pairs of terms from each polynomial whose exponents add up to 4. The polynomials are:- First polynomial (P1): (1 - 2x + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 16x^4)- Second polynomial (P2): (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + 16x^4)We identify the pairs of terms from P1 and P2 that contribute to the (x^4) term:1. (x^0) from P1 and (x^4) from P2: (1 cdot 16x^4 = 16x^4)2. (x^1) from P1 and (x^3) from P2: (-2x cdot 8x^3 = -16x^4)3. (x^2) from P1 and (x^2) from P2: (4x^2 cdot 4x^2 = 16x^4)4.

The left side of the equation involves a cosine squared term, which has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0. So the left-hand side (LHS) ranges from 1 to 2. The right-hand side (RHS) is a rational function of ( x ) and ( y ). Since the LHS is between 1 and 2, the RHS must also lie within this interval. That might help in constraining the values of ( x ) and ( y ).First, maybe I should simplify the RHS. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.The numerator is ( x^2 + y^2 + 2(x + 1)(1 - y) ). Let me expand that:( 2(x + 1)(1 - y) = 2[(x)(1 - y) + 1(1 - y)] = 2x(1 - y) + 2(1 - y) = 2x - 2xy + 2 - 2y ).So the numerator becomes:( x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2xy + 2 - 2y ).Let me combine like terms:- ( x^2 ) term: ( x^2 )- ( y^2 ) term: ( y^2 )- ( x ) terms: ( 2x )- ( y ) terms: ( -2y )- ( xy ) term: ( -2xy )- Constant term: ( +2 )So the numerator is ( x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 2xy + 2 ).The denominator is ( x - y + 1 ).Hmm, maybe the numerator can be rewritten or factored. Let me try to rearrange the numerator:Group the ( x^2 ), ( 2x ), and the ( -2xy ):( x^2 + 2x - 2xy )And then the remaining terms: ( y^2 - 2y + 2 ).Factor out ( x ) from the first group: ( x(x + 2 - 2y) + y^2 - 2y + 2 ). Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe complete the square for ( x ) or ( y ).Let me try completing the square for ( x ):Numerator: ( x^2 + 2x - 2xy + y^2 - 2y + 2 ).Let me consider the terms involving ( x ):( x^2 + 2x - 2xy = x^2 - 2xy + 2x ).Factor out ( x ): ( x(x - 2y + 2) ). Not sure.Alternatively, group ( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ) which is ( (x - y)^2 ). Let's check:( (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ). So in the numerator:( (x - y)^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 ).Ah, that's better. So numerator can be written as:( (x - y)^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 ).Now, the denominator is ( x - y + 1 ). Let me set ( z = x - y ). Then the numerator becomes ( z^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 ), and the denominator is ( z + 1 ).But ( 2x - 2y = 2(x - y) = 2z ). So numerator is ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ), denominator is ( z + 1 ). Therefore, the RHS simplifies to:( frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} ).Where ( z = x - y ). So now, the equation becomes:( 1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} ).Let me compute ( frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} ). Maybe perform polynomial division:Divide ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ) by ( z + 1 ).( z + 1 ),, z^2 + 2z + 2 )First term: ( z^2 / z = z ), multiply back ( z(z + 1) = z^2 + z ).Subtract from numerator: ( (z^2 + 2z + 2) - (z^2 + z) = z + 2 ).Next term: ( z / z = 1 ), multiply back ( 1(z + 1) = z + 1 ).Subtract: ( (z + 2) - (z + 1) = 1 ).So the division gives ( z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1} ). Therefore,( frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1} ).Therefore, the equation becomes:( 1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1} ).Simplify both sides:Subtract 1 from both sides:( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = z + frac{1}{z + 1} ).Recall that ( z = x - y ), so:( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = (x - y) + frac{1}{(x - y) + 1} ).Hmm. Let me denote ( t = x - y ). Then, the equation is:( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = t + frac{1}{t + 1} ).But ( t = x - y ), so we can express ( x = t + y ). Substitute this into the argument of the cosine:( 2x + 3y - 1 = 2(t + y) + 3y - 1 = 2t + 2y + 3y - 1 = 2t + 5y - 1 ).So the equation becomes:( cos^{2}(2t + 5y - 1) = t + frac{1}{t + 1} ).But this seems to complicate things. Maybe instead of substituting ( t = x - y ), I should think of other approaches.Alternatively, note that the RHS ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} ). Let me analyze this function.Let ( f(t) = t + frac{1}{t + 1} ), where ( t = x - y ).But since the LHS is ( cos^2(text{something}) ), which is between 0 and 1. Therefore, ( f(t) ) must lie between 0 and 1.So:( 0 leq t + frac{1}{t + 1} leq 1 ).Therefore, we can find the possible values of ( t ) such that ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} in [0, 1] ).Let me solve for ( t ):First, the domain of ( f(t) ):The denominator ( t + 1 neq 0 Rightarrow t neq -1 ).So ( t in mathbb{R} setminus {-1} ).Now, solve ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} leq 1 ).Let me rewrite the inequality:( t + frac{1}{t + 1} leq 1 )Multiply both sides by ( t + 1 ), but need to consider the sign of ( t + 1 ).Case 1: ( t + 1 > 0 Rightarrow t > -1 ).Then, multiplying both sides by ( t + 1 ):( t(t + 1) + 1 leq (t + 1)(1) )Simplify left side: ( t^2 + t + 1 leq t + 1 )Subtract ( t + 1 ) from both sides:( t^2 leq 0 )Which implies ( t = 0 ).Case 2: ( t + 1 < 0 Rightarrow t < -1 ).Multiply both sides by ( t + 1 ), which is negative, so inequality flips:( t(t + 1) + 1 geq (t + 1)(1) )Simplify left side: ( t^2 + t + 1 geq t + 1 )Subtract ( t + 1 ):( t^2 geq 0 )Which is always true.Therefore, for the inequality ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} leq 1 ):- If ( t > -1 ), then ( t = 0 ).- If ( t < -1 ), all ( t ).But we also need ( f(t) geq 0 ).So check when ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} geq 0 ).Again, consider cases.Case 1: ( t > -1 ):Then, ( t + 1 > 0 ), so ( frac{1}{t + 1} > 0 ). Therefore, ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} geq 0 ).But if ( t geq 0 ), then both terms are non-negative, so sum is non-negative. If ( -1 < t < 0 ), then ( t ) is negative, but ( frac{1}{t + 1} ) is positive. Need to check if the sum is non-negative.Let ( t = -0.5 ): Then ( f(t) = -0.5 + frac{1}{-0.5 + 1} = -0.5 + 2 = 1.5 geq 0.t approaching -1 from the right: t approaches -1, so ( frac{1}{t + 1} ) approaches infinity. So ( f(t) ) approaches infinity. So for ( t > -1 ), ( f(t) geq 0 ) only when? Wait, actually, if ( t > -1 ), then even if ( t ) is negative, ( frac{1}{t + 1} ) can be large positive. For example, t = -0.9: f(t) = -0.9 + 1/(0.1) = -0.9 + 10 = 9.1. So even when t is negative but greater than -1, f(t) is positive. Therefore, for all ( t > -1 ), ( f(t) geq 0 ).Case 2: ( t < -1 ):Then, ( t + 1 < 0 ), so denominator negative. Let me compute ( f(t) = t + frac{1}{t + 1} ).Let me set ( t = -2 ):f(-2) = -2 + 1/(-1) = -2 -1 = -3 < 0.t = -3: f(-3) = -3 + 1/(-2) = -3 - 0.5 = -3.5 < 0.So for ( t < -1 ), ( f(t) ) is negative. Therefore, the inequality ( f(t) geq 0 ) only holds when ( t > -1 ).But from the previous inequality, ( f(t) leq 1 ), which for ( t > -1 ) only holds when ( t = 0 ).Therefore, combining both conditions:Since LHS is ( cos^2(...) in [0,1] ), RHS must be in [0,1].But for RHS to be in [0,1], we saw that only possible when t = 0 (since for t > -1, only t =0 satisfies f(t) ≤1, and for t < -1, f(t) is negative which is allowed only if LHS is zero. Wait, but LHS is ( cos^2 ), so it can be zero. Let me check.Wait, if RHS is in [0,1], but the LHS is ( cos^2 ), which is in [0,1]. So equality can hold when RHS is between 0 and 1. However, from previous analysis:If t > -1:- Only t = 0 gives RHS = 0 + 1/(0 +1) =1, so RHS =1. Therefore, LHS must be 1, so ( cos^2(...) =1 ).If t < -1:- Then RHS is negative, but LHS is non-negative (since cosine squared is non-negative). Therefore, equality only possible if RHS =0 and LHS=0.But RHS is negative for t < -1, so cannot be zero. Therefore, only possible solution is t =0.Wait, let's double-check.Given the equation:( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = t + frac{1}{t + 1} ).Since the LHS is non-negative, the RHS must also be non-negative. Therefore, we must have ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} geq 0 ).From earlier analysis, this occurs only when t > -1. So even though t < -1 could satisfy the inequality ( t + frac{1}{t + 1} leq 1 ), since RHS must be non-negative, t < -1 is invalid because RHS would be negative. Hence, only possible when t > -1, and in that case, the equation simplifies to t =0.Therefore, the only possible solution is t =0. Therefore, x - y =0 => x = y.Wait, is that right? If t = x - y =0, then x = y.Substituting x = y into the original equation:Left side: (1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3x -1) =1 + cos^{2}(5x -1)).Right side: ( frac{x^{2} + x^{2} + 2(x +1)(1 - x)}{x - x +1} ).Simplify the denominator: 1.Numerator: 2x² + 2(x +1)(1 - x).Compute 2(x +1)(1 -x) = 2[(1)(1 -x) + x(1 -x)] = 2[1 -x + x -x²] = 2(1 -x²).Therefore, numerator becomes 2x² + 2(1 -x²) = 2x² + 2 - 2x² = 2.Therefore, RHS is 2/1 =2.Therefore, the equation becomes:1 + cos²(5x -1) =2.Subtract 1:cos²(5x -1)=1.Which implies that cos(5x -1)= ±1, so 5x -1 = kπ, where k is integer.Thus, 5x =1 +kπ => x=(1 +kπ)/5.Since x = y, then y=(1 +kπ)/5.Therefore, the solutions are x = y = (1 +kπ)/5 for integers k.Now, the problem asks for the minimum value of xy. Since x = y, then xy =x². So we need to find the minimum value of x² where x=(1 +kπ)/5 for integer k.Since x² is always non-negative, the minimum value is 0, but x can't be zero unless 1 +kπ=0 => k= -1/π, which is not an integer. Therefore, the minimal x² occurs when |x| is minimized.Find the integer k that minimizes |(1 +kπ)/5|.Let me compute |1 +kπ| for different integers k.Let's see:For k=0: |1 +0|=1.For k= -1: |1 -π|≈|1 -3.1416|≈2.1416.For k=1: |1 +π|≈4.1416.k= -2: |1 -2π|≈|1 -6.2832|≈5.2832.Similarly, as |k| increases, |1 +kπ| increases. Therefore, the minimal value occurs at k=0, giving |x|=1/5.Therefore, the minimal xy is (1/5)^2=1/25=0.04.But wait, let me confirm.If k=0: x=(1 +0)/5=1/5. Then xy=(1/5)^2=1/25.But could there be another solution where x ≠ y? Wait, earlier analysis concluded that only x=y is possible. Because when t = x - y ≠0, the RHS would be greater than1 (if t>0) or negative (if t < -1), but since RHS must be between 0 and1 (as LHS is cos² between 0 and1), the only possible solution is t=0, leading to x=y.Therefore, the minimal value of xy is 1/25.Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the minimum value of xy. Since x and y are equal here, and xy =x². But x² is minimized when x is closest to zero. As we saw, the minimal |x| is 1/5, so x²=1/25. Therefore, the minimal xy is 1/25.But let me check for other possible solutions where maybe the RHS is less than 1. Wait, earlier we concluded that t must be 0. Because when t > -1, only t=0 gives RHS=1, which matches the maximum of the LHS (since LHS is 1 + cos²(...), which is at most 2; wait, no, the equation after subtracting 1 is cos²(...) = RHS. So cos²(...) must equal to RHS. Since cos² is between 0 and1, RHS must also be between 0 and1. Therefore, RHS must be between 0 and1. However, when we set t= x - y, and found that t must be 0 because for t > -1, only t=0 gives RHS=1. But if the RHS is allowed to be less than1, then perhaps there are other solutions?Wait, going back. Let me recap.Original equation:1 + cos²(2x +3y -1) = [expression]After simplifying, we had:cos²(2x +3y -1) = t + 1/(t +1), where t =x - y.But cos²(theta) is between 0 and1, so t +1/(t +1) must be between 0 and1.Earlier, when t > -1, we found that f(t)= t +1/(t +1) <=1 only when t=0, giving f(t)=1. For t < -1, f(t) is negative, which can't equal to cos²(...) which is non-negative. Therefore, only possible solution is t=0, leading to cos²(...)=1. So cos(theta)=±1, leading to theta= kπ. Therefore, 2x +3y -1= kπ.But since t= x - y=0, then x=y. So substituting x=y into 2x +3y -1= kπ => 5x -1= kπ =>x=(1 +kπ)/5.Therefore, the solutions are x=(1 +kπ)/5, y=(1 +kπ)/5 for integer k.Therefore, xy= x²= [(1 +kπ)/5]^2.To minimize xy, we need to minimize [(1 +kπ)/5]^2. Since k is integer, we need to choose k such that |1 +kπ| is minimized.k=0: |1 +0|=1 => x=1/5, xy=1/25≈0.04k=-1: |1 -π|≈2.1416 => x≈(1 -3.1416)/5≈-0.4283, xy≈0.1834k=1: |1 +π|≈4.1416 => x≈0.8283, xy≈0.6862Therefore, the minimal xy is at k=0, giving xy=1/25.Hence, the minimum value of xy is 1/25.But wait, hold on. Let me check if there's a case where even though t= x - y ≠0, but the RHS is still between 0 and1. Wait, according to the earlier analysis, no. Because when t > -1, except t=0, f(t)= t +1/(t +1) is greater than1. For example, t=1: f(1)=1 +1/2=1.5>1.t=0.5: f(0.5)=0.5 +1/1.5≈0.5 +0.6667≈1.1667>1.t approaching -1 from above: t approaches -1, t +1 approaches 0, so 1/(t +1) approaches infinity. So f(t) approaches infinity. Thus, for t >-1, t≠0, f(t) >1. Therefore, RHS would be greater than1, which would require LHS=cos²(...)= greater than1, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible solution is t=0. So x=y is the only case.Therefore, the minimal xy is 1/25.But let me check if there's another approach where maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers or something else. Let me try.We need to minimize xy subject to the constraint:1 + cos²(2x +3y -1) = (x² + y² + 2(x +1)(1 - y))/(x - y +1)But given that we have already reduced the problem to x=y, perhaps that is the only feasible solution.Alternatively, suppose we didn't do that substitution. Let's try another way.Let me denote u = x - y. Then, from the previous steps, the equation reduces to:cos²(2x +3y -1) = u + 1/(u +1)But since u = x - y, and we need to minimize xy. Let me express y =x -u.So substituting y =x - u into the equation:cos²(2x +3(x - u) -1) = u + 1/(u +1)Simplify the argument:2x +3x -3u -1=5x -3u -1.Therefore:cos²(5x -3u -1)=u +1/(u +1)But u =x - y, but since we expressed y =x -u, u is just a variable here.But perhaps it's getting too convoluted. Maybe stick to the previous conclusion.Given that the only solutions are x=y=(1 +kπ)/5, then the minimal xy is (1/5)^2=1/25.But to make sure, let's check with k=0: x=y=1/5. Let's verify if this satisfies the original equation.Compute LHS:1 +cos²(2*(1/5) +3*(1/5) -1)=1 +cos²( (2/5 +3/5) -1 )=1 +cos²(1 -1)=1 +cos²(0)=1 +1=2.RHS: [ ( (1/5)^2 + (1/5)^2 +2*(1/5 +1)*(1 -1/5) ) / (1/5 -1/5 +1) ]Compute numerator:(1/25 +1/25) + 2*(6/5)*(4/5) = (2/25) + 2*(24/25) = 2/25 +48/25=50/25=2.Denominator:1.So RHS=2/1=2. Therefore, LHS=RHS=2. So it's valid.Therefore, this solution is valid. For other k, like k=1:x=y=(1 +π)/5≈(1 +3.1416)/5≈0.8283.Compute LHS:1 +cos²(5x -1)=1 +cos²(5*(0.8283) -1)=1 +cos²(4.1415 -1)=1 +cos²(3.1415)=1 +cos²(π)=1 +(-1)^2=2.RHS: [x² + y² +2(x +1)(1 - y)]/(x - y +1)= [2x² +2(x +1)(1 -x)]/1. Since x=y, same as before: 2x² +2(1 -x²)=2.Thus, RHS=2. So LHS=RHS=2, valid.Thus, regardless of k, the equation holds, but the xy is x²=(1 +kπ)^2/25. To minimize this, we need to minimize |1 +kπ|. Since k is integer, the minimal |1 +kπ| occurs at k=0, giving 1. For any other integer k, |1 +kπ| is larger. Therefore, the minimum value of xy is (1/5)^2=1/25.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{1}{25}}.Final AnswerThe minimum value of (xy) is boxed{dfrac{1}{25}}.</think>Given the equation:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = frac{x^{2} + y^{2} + 2(x + 1)(1 - y)}{x - y + 1}]we need to find the minimum value of (xy).First, we simplify the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation. The numerator (x^2 + y^2 + 2(x + 1)(1 - y)) expands to:[x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2xy + 2 - 2y]This can be rewritten as:[(x - y)^2 + 2x - 2y + 2]Letting (z = x - y), the numerator becomes (z^2 + 2z + 2) and the denominator is (z + 1). Thus, the RHS simplifies to:[frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1}]The equation then becomes:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1}]Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:[cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = z + frac{1}{z + 1}]Since (cos^2) ranges between 0 and 1, the RHS must also be between 0 and 1. Analyzing (z + frac{1}{z + 1}), we find that it must be non-negative and at most 1. This leads to the conclusion that (z = 0) (i.e., (x = y)).Substituting (x = y) into the original equation, we simplify both sides and verify that the equation holds. This gives us solutions where (x = y = frac{1 + kpi}{5}) for integers (k). To minimize (xy = x^2), we need the smallest (|x|). The minimum occurs at (k = 0), giving (x = frac{1}{5}). Thus, the minimum value of (xy) is:[left(frac{1}{5}right)^2 = frac{1}{25}]Therefore, the minimum value of (xy) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{25}}).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the minimum value of ( xy ) given the equation:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = frac{x^{2} + y^{2} + 2(x + 1)(1 - y)}{x - y + 1}]Hmm, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying. On the left side, we have ( 1 + cos^{2}(text{something}) ). Since the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, its square will be between 0 and 1. So ( cos^{2}(theta) ) ranges from 0 to 1, which means the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is between 1 and 2. That gives us a constraint: the right-hand side (RHS) must also be between 1 and 2.So first, maybe I should simplify the RHS expression to see if I can find a relationship between ( x ) and ( y ). Let me work on the numerator and denominator separately.The numerator is ( x^{2} + y^{2} + 2(x + 1)(1 - y) ). Let me expand that:First, expand ( 2(x + 1)(1 - y) ):( 2[(x)(1) + x(-y) + 1(1) + 1(-y)] = 2[x - xy + 1 - y] = 2x - 2xy + 2 - 2y )So the numerator becomes:( x^{2} + y^{2} + 2x - 2xy + 2 - 2y )Let me combine like terms:- ( x^{2} ) term: ( x^2 )- ( y^{2} ) term: ( y^2 )- ( x ) terms: ( 2x )- ( y ) terms: ( -2y )- ( xy ) term: ( -2xy )- Constant term: ( +2 )So the numerator is ( x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 2xy + 2 ).Now the denominator is ( x - y + 1 ). So the entire RHS is:[frac{x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 2xy + 2}{x - y + 1}]Hmm. Maybe this can be simplified further. Let me check if the numerator can be factored or expressed in terms of the denominator.Alternatively, perhaps substituting variables. Let me let ( a = x - y + 1 ). Then the denominator is ( a ). Let's see if the numerator can be expressed in terms of ( a ). But I'm not sure yet. Let me try rearranging terms.Looking at the numerator:( x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 2xy + 2 )This looks a bit like a quadratic in two variables. Let me try to complete the square or see if it factors.Let me group terms:( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 )Notice that ( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x - y)^2 ). So the numerator becomes:( (x - y)^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 )Hmm, let's see. Let me set ( z = x - y ). Then the numerator is ( z^2 + 2x - 2y + 2 ). But ( z = x - y ), so ( 2x - 2y = 2(x - y) = 2z ). So substituting:( z^2 + 2z + 2 )So the numerator simplifies to ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ), where ( z = x - y ). Therefore, the RHS becomes:[frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1}]Because the denominator is ( x - y + 1 = z + 1 ).So now, the RHS is:[frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1}]Let me perform the division here. Let's divide ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ) by ( z + 1 ).Dividing ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ) by ( z + 1 ):- ( z^2 ÷ z = z ), multiply ( z + 1 ) by ( z ): ( z^2 + z )- Subtract: ( (z^2 + 2z) - (z^2 + z) = z )- Bring down the +2: ( z + 2 )- ( z ÷ z = 1 ), multiply ( z + 1 ) by 1: ( z + 1 )- Subtract: ( (z + 2) - (z + 1) = 1 )So the division gives ( z + 1 ) with a remainder of 1. Therefore:[frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1}]So the RHS simplifies to ( z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1} ), where ( z = x - y ).Therefore, the original equation becomes:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1}]But ( z = x - y ), so substituting back:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = (x - y) + 1 + frac{1}{(x - y) + 1} = (x - y + 1) + frac{1}{x - y + 1}]So now, let me denote ( t = x - y + 1 ). Then the RHS is ( t + frac{1}{t} ).Therefore, the equation becomes:[1 + cos^{2}(text{expression}) = t + frac{1}{t}]But remember that the LHS is between 1 and 2. Because ( cos^{2}(theta) ) is between 0 and 1, so ( 1 + cos^{2}(theta) ) is between 1 and 2. So the RHS must also be between 1 and 2. Therefore, ( t + frac{1}{t} ) must be between 1 and 2.But let's analyze the function ( f(t) = t + frac{1}{t} ). For real positive ( t ), the function has a minimum at ( t = 1 ), where ( f(t) = 2 ). For ( t > 0 ), the function is greater than or equal to 2. If ( t < 0 ), then ( t + 1/t ) can be less than 2, but in this case, the denominator in the original expression is ( x - y + 1 ), so ( t = x - y + 1 ). Therefore, we need to consider whether ( t ) can be negative.Wait, but if ( t = x - y + 1 ), then the denominator in the original RHS is ( t ), so ( t ) cannot be zero. However, depending on ( x ) and ( y ), ( t ) can be positive or negative. However, the LHS is between 1 and 2, which are positive values. Therefore, the RHS must also be positive. Since the LHS is at least 1, the RHS must be at least 1, and since ( t + 1/t ) can be positive or negative depending on ( t ).But let's consider ( t > 0 ). If ( t > 0 ), then ( t + 1/t geq 2 ), with equality at ( t = 1 ). If ( t < 0 ), let’s set ( t = -s ), where ( s > 0 ). Then ( f(t) = -s - 1/s ), which is negative. But since the LHS is between 1 and 2, which is positive, the RHS must also be positive. Therefore, ( t + 1/t ) must be positive. Therefore, either ( t > 0 ) and ( t + 1/t geq 2 ), or ( t < 0 ) but ( t + 1/t ) is positive. Wait, but if ( t < 0 ), then ( t + 1/t = - (s + 1/s) ), which is negative. So to have RHS positive, we must have ( t > 0 ). Therefore, ( t = x - y + 1 > 0 ).Therefore, ( t > 0 ), so ( x - y + 1 > 0 ). Then ( t + 1/t geq 2 ), with equality when ( t = 1 ). But the LHS is ( 1 + cos^{2}(text{expression}) ), which is between 1 and 2. Wait, but if the RHS is at least 2, and the LHS is at most 2, then the only possible value where they can be equal is when both sides equal 2. Therefore, the equation can only hold when both sides are equal to 2. Therefore:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = 2 quad text{and} quad t + frac{1}{t} = 2]So from ( t + 1/t = 2 ), we get ( t = 1 ). Therefore:( t = x - y + 1 = 1 implies x - y + 1 = 1 implies x - y = 0 implies x = y )And from the LHS, ( 1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = 2 implies cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = 1 implies cos(2x + 3y - 1) = pm 1 implies 2x + 3y - 1 = kpi ) for some integer ( k ). But since ( x = y ), we can substitute ( x = y ) into this equation:( 2x + 3x - 1 = 5x - 1 = kpi implies 5x = kpi + 1 implies x = frac{kpi + 1}{5} )Therefore, ( x = y = frac{kpi + 1}{5} ) for some integer ( k ).Therefore, the possible solutions are ( x = y = frac{kpi + 1}{5} ). Now, we need to find the minimum value of ( xy ). Since ( x = y ), ( xy = x^2 ). So we need to find the minimum of ( x^2 ) where ( x = frac{kpi + 1}{5} ) for integer ( k ).But ( x^2 ) is always non-negative, and it can get as small as possible when ( x ) is as close to 0 as possible. So we need to find the integer ( k ) such that ( frac{kpi + 1}{5} ) is closest to 0.Let’s solve for ( k ):We want ( frac{kpi + 1}{5} ) as close to 0 as possible. Let's denote ( x = frac{kpi + 1}{5} ). So we need ( kpi + 1 ) as close to 0 as possible. Since ( k ) is an integer, and ( pi ) is approximately 3.1416, let's see:If ( k = -1 ):( x = frac{ -pi + 1 }{5} approx frac{ -3.1416 + 1 }{5} = frac{ -2.1416 }{5} approx -0.4283 )If ( k = 0 ):( x = frac{0 + 1}{5} = 0.2 )If ( k = 1 ):( x = frac{pi + 1}{5} ≈ frac{3.1416 + 1}{5} ≈ 0.8283 )If ( k = -2 ):( x = frac{ -2pi + 1 }{5} ≈ frac{ -6.2832 + 1 }{5} ≈ frac{ -5.2832 }{5} ≈ -1.0566 )So the values of ( x ) for different ( k ):- ( k = -2 ): ≈ -1.0566- ( k = -1 ): ≈ -0.4283- ( k = 0 ): 0.2- ( k = 1 ): ≈ 0.8283- etc.So the closest ( x ) to 0 is when ( k = 0 ), which gives ( x = 0.2 ), and the next closest is ( k = -1 ) with ( x ≈ -0.4283 ). But since ( x^2 ) is the square, the smallest ( x^2 ) will be the one with the smallest absolute value. So between 0.2 and -0.4283, the smallest absolute value is 0.2. So the minimum ( x^2 ) is ( (0.2)^2 = 0.04 ). However, we need to check if there's a ( k ) that gives a smaller ( x^2 ).Wait, but for negative ( k ), ( x ) is negative, but ( x^2 ) is still positive. So let's see:For ( k = 0 ): ( x = 0.2 ), ( x^2 = 0.04 )For ( k = -1 ): ( x ≈ -0.4283 ), ( x^2 ≈ 0.1834 )For ( k = 1 ): ( x ≈ 0.8283 ), ( x^2 ≈ 0.6862 )For ( k = -2 ): ( x ≈ -1.0566 ), ( x^2 ≈ 1.1164 )So indeed, the minimum ( x^2 ) occurs at ( k = 0 ), giving ( x = y = 0.2 ), so ( xy = 0.04 ).Wait a second, but is there a non-integer ( k ) that could get closer? But the problem states that the equation must hold for real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), but the solutions we found are for integer ( k ). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the equation ( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = 1 ) implies that ( 2x + 3y -1 = kpi ), for some integer ( k ), right? Because ( cos(theta) = pm 1 ) when ( theta = kpi ), so ( theta = kpi ), ( k in mathbb{Z} ). Therefore, the solutions for ( x ) and ( y ) are parametrized by integer ( k ).But since ( k ) can be any integer, positive or negative, but we need to check if there's a ( k ) such that ( x ) is real and ( xy ) is minimized. However, since ( x = y ), ( xy = x^2 ), so minimizing ( xy ) is equivalent to minimizing ( x^2 ). The minimal ( x^2 ) occurs when ( x ) is closest to zero. From the previous calculations, the closest is at ( k = 0 ), giving ( x = 0.2 ), so ( xy = 0.04 ).But wait, let me check if this is indeed the case.Given ( x = y = frac{1}{5} ), let's verify the original equation.First, compute the LHS: ( 1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) )Since ( x = y = 0.2 ), then ( 2x + 3y - 1 = 2*0.2 + 3*0.2 - 1 = 0.4 + 0.6 - 1 = 0. So the argument inside the cosine is 0. Then ( cos(0) = 1 ), so ( cos^{2}(0) = 1 ), so LHS = 1 + 1 = 2.Now the RHS:Compute numerator: ( x^2 + y^2 + 2(x + 1)(1 - y) )Substituting ( x = y = 0.2 ):Numerator: ( 0.2^2 + 0.2^2 + 2*(0.2 + 1)*(1 - 0.2) = 0.04 + 0.04 + 2*(1.2)*(0.8) = 0.08 + 2*0.96 = 0.08 + 1.92 = 2 )Denominator: ( x - y + 1 = 0.2 - 0.2 + 1 = 1 )So RHS = 2 / 1 = 2. Therefore, both sides equal 2. So this solution is valid.Therefore, the minimal value of ( xy ) is ( 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04 ), which is ( frac{1}{25} ).Wait, but 0.04 is 1/25. So in fractional terms, since ( x = y = frac{1}{5} ), so ( xy = left( frac{1}{5} right)^2 = frac{1}{25} ).But let me check if there are other solutions where ( x neq y ), but the equation still holds. Wait, earlier reasoning suggested that ( x = y ) is required because ( t = x - y + 1 = 1 implies x - y = 0 implies x = y ). Therefore, all solutions must satisfy ( x = y ). Therefore, the only solutions are those with ( x = y ), which gives ( xy = x^2 ), and the minimal ( x^2 ) is at ( k = 0 ), giving ( x = y = 1/5 ), hence ( xy = 1/25 ).Therefore, the minimum value of ( xy ) is ( frac{1}{25} ).But just to ensure there's no other scenario where the equation holds with ( xy ) smaller than ( frac{1}{25} ), let me consider the possibility that even though the RHS must be between 1 and 2, perhaps if the RHS is not exactly 2, but since LHS can only go up to 2, so the maximum of LHS is 2, and the minimum of RHS is 2 (since ( t + 1/t geq 2 )), so equality must hold at 2. Therefore, there's no other solution except when both sides equal 2, which requires ( t = 1 ) and ( cos^{2} = 1 ). Therefore, the only solutions are those we found with ( x = y ).Therefore, the minimal value of ( xy ) is indeed ( frac{1}{25} ).Final AnswerThe minimum value of ( xy ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{25}}.</think>Given the equation:[1 + cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = frac{x^{2} + y^{2} + 2(x + 1)(1 - y)}{x - y + 1}]we start by simplifying the right-hand side (RHS). The numerator is expanded and simplified to:[x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 2y - 2xy + 2]Letting ( z = x - y ), the numerator becomes ( z^2 + 2z + 2 ). The denominator is ( x - y + 1 = z + 1 ). Thus, the RHS simplifies to:[frac{z^2 + 2z + 2}{z + 1} = z + 1 + frac{1}{z + 1}]Letting ( t = z + 1 ), the RHS becomes ( t + frac{1}{t} ). The left-hand side (LHS) is between 1 and 2, so the RHS must also be between 1 and 2. However, ( t + frac{1}{t} geq 2 ) for ( t > 0 ), with equality when ( t = 1 ). Therefore, we must have ( t = 1 ), implying ( x - y + 1 = 1 ) or ( x = y ).For the LHS to be 2, ( cos^{2}(2x + 3y - 1) = 1 ), leading to ( 2x + 3y - 1 = kpi ) for integer ( k ). Substituting ( x = y ), we get ( 5x - 1 = kpi ) or ( x = frac{kpi + 1}{5} ).To minimize ( xy = x^2 ), we find the smallest ( x^2 ) for integer ( k ). The closest ( x ) to 0 occurs at ( k = 0 ), giving ( x = y = frac{1}{5} ). Thus, ( xy = left( frac{1}{5} right)^2 = frac{1}{25} ).Verifying, substituting ( x = y = frac{1}{5} ) into the original equation confirms both sides equal 2.

So, we have triangle ABC where angle A is twice angle B. The side opposite angle A is 12 cm, and the side opposite angle B is 8 cm. We need to find the length of the third side. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some triangle theorems that might help here. Since we know two angles and their opposite sides, maybe the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines could be useful here. Let's see.First, let's note down what's given. Let me denote angle B as θ. Then angle A would be 2θ. Since it's a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. So, angle C would be 180° - angle A - angle B = 180° - 2θ - θ = 180° - 3θ. So, angle C is 180° - 3θ.Now, according to the Law of Sines, the ratio of each side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, in triangle ABC, we have:12 / sin(2θ) = 8 / sin(θ) = c / sin(180° - 3θ)Wait, sin(180° - 3θ) is the same as sin(3θ) because sine of (180° - x) is sin x. So, angle C's sine is sin(3θ). So, the third side, which is opposite angle C, let's call that c. Then c = [sin(3θ) * 12] / sin(2θ) or something like that? Maybe. But perhaps I need to find θ first.Let me try to use the given sides and angles. So, 12 is opposite angle A (2θ) and 8 is opposite angle B (θ). So, by the Law of Sines:12 / sin(2θ) = 8 / sin(θ)Let me write that equation:12 / sin(2θ) = 8 / sinθSo, cross-multiplying:12 sinθ = 8 sin2θBut sin2θ is 2 sinθ cosθ, right? So:12 sinθ = 8 * 2 sinθ cosθSimplify that:12 sinθ = 16 sinθ cosθHmm, so divide both sides by sinθ, assuming sinθ ≠ 0. Well, θ is an angle in a triangle, so it can't be 0. So, that's safe.12 = 16 cosθTherefore, cosθ = 12 / 16 = 3/4So, cosθ = 3/4. Then θ = arccos(3/4). Let me compute that. But maybe we don't need the exact value of θ. Let's see.We can now find sinθ. Since cosθ = 3/4, then sinθ = sqrt(1 - (3/4)^2) = sqrt(1 - 9/16) = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt7 / 4.So, sinθ = sqrt7 / 4.Now, we can find sin2θ. Since sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ = 2*(sqrt7/4)*(3/4) = (6 sqrt7)/16 = (3 sqrt7)/8.So, sin2θ = 3 sqrt7 / 8.Now, angle C is 180° - 3θ, and the side opposite to angle C is c. By the Law of Sines again, c / sin(3θ) = 12 / sin(2θ). So, c = [12 * sin(3θ)] / sin(2θ).So, I need to compute sin(3θ). Let's recall that sin3θ = 3 sinθ - 4 sin^3θ.Alternatively, we can use the identity sin(3θ) = sin(2θ + θ) = sin2θ cosθ + cos2θ sinθ. Maybe that's easier.So, sin3θ = sin2θ cosθ + cos2θ sinθ.We already know sin2θ = 3 sqrt7 / 8, cosθ = 3/4, sinθ = sqrt7 / 4.We need cos2θ. Let's compute that. cos2θ = 2 cos^2θ - 1 = 2*(9/16) - 1 = 18/16 - 1 = 2/16 = 1/8.Alternatively, cos2θ could be 1 - 2 sin^2θ = 1 - 2*(7/16) = 1 - 14/16 = 2/16 = 1/8. Either way, cos2θ = 1/8.So, sin3θ = sin2θ cosθ + cos2θ sinθ = (3 sqrt7 / 8)(3/4) + (1/8)(sqrt7 / 4)Compute each term:First term: (3 sqrt7 / 8)(3/4) = 9 sqrt7 / 32Second term: (1/8)(sqrt7 / 4) = sqrt7 / 32So, sin3θ = 9 sqrt7 /32 + sqrt7 /32 = 10 sqrt7 /32 = 5 sqrt7 /16Therefore, sin3θ = 5 sqrt7 /16.So, going back to c = [12 * sin3θ] / sin2θWe have:12 * (5 sqrt7 /16) divided by (3 sqrt7 /8)Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: 12 * 5 sqrt7 /16 = (60 sqrt7)/16 = (15 sqrt7)/4Denominator: 3 sqrt7 /8So, c = (15 sqrt7 /4) / (3 sqrt7 /8)Dividing these two fractions: multiply by reciprocal.So, (15 sqrt7 /4) * (8 /3 sqrt7)Simplify:The sqrt7 terms cancel out.15/4 * 8/3 = (15 *8)/(4*3) = (120)/12 = 10Wait, so c = 10?Wait, that seems too clean. Let me check the calculations again.Wait, numerator: 12 * 5 sqrt7 /1612/16 simplifies to 3/4, so 3/4 *5 sqrt7 = 15 sqrt7 /4. Correct.Denominator: 3 sqrt7 /8So, dividing numerator by denominator:(15 sqrt7 /4) ÷ (3 sqrt7 /8) = (15/4) ÷ (3/8) = (15/4)*(8/3) = (15*8)/(4*3) = (120)/12 = 10. Yes, correct. The sqrt7 cancels out.So, c = 10 cm. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me verify if that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe use Law of Cosines to find the third side? Let me try that as a check.Law of Cosines says that c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(angle opposite c)Wait, in this case, the third side is opposite angle C, which is 180° - 3θ. So, angle C is 3θ? Wait, no, angle C is 180° - 3θ, but the side opposite is c. Wait, but in Law of Cosines, we can use angle C. Wait, but angle C is 180° - 3θ, so cos(angle C) = cos(180° - 3θ) = -cos(3θ).So, c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(angle C) = 12² + 8² - 2*12*8*(-cos3θ) = 144 + 64 + 192 cos3θ = 208 + 192 cos3θ.Hmm, so if we can compute cos3θ, then we can compute c.Alternatively, let's compute cos3θ. Since we know cosθ = 3/4, we can use the triple-angle formula:cos3θ = 4 cos^3θ - 3 cosθ = 4*(3/4)^3 - 3*(3/4) = 4*(27/64) - 9/4 = (108/64) - (144/64) = (-36/64) = -9/16.Therefore, cos3θ = -9/16.So, plugging back into c² = 208 + 192*(-9/16) = 208 - 192*(9/16)Compute 192/16 = 12, so 12*9 = 108. Therefore, c² = 208 - 108 = 100. So, c = sqrt(100) = 10. So, same result. So, that confirms that the third side is 10 cm.Therefore, the answer is 10 cm.Final AnswerThe length of the third side is boxed{10} centimeters.</think>Given triangle (ABC) where angle (A) is twice angle (B), and the sides opposite these angles are 12 cm and 8 cm respectively, we need to find the length of the third side.1. Assign Variables to Angles:   - Let angle (B = theta).   - Then angle (A = 2theta).   - Angle (C = 180^circ - 3theta).2.

Apply the Law of Sines Again for the Third Side (c):   [   frac{c}{sin(3theta)} = frac{12}{sin(2theta)} implies c = frac{12 cdot sin(3theta)}{sin(2theta)} = frac{12 cdot frac{5sqrt{7}}{16}}{frac{3sqrt{7}}{8}} = frac{12 cdot 5sqrt{7} cdot 8}{16 cdot 3sqrt{7}} = 10   ]6.

Let me start by recalling some trigonometry rules. Hmm, the Law of Sines might be helpful here because it relates angles and their opposite sides. The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant. So, if I denote the angles as A, B, and C, and the sides opposite them as a, b, and c respectively, then:a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin CIn this problem, angle A is twice angle B. Let me write that down:Angle A = 2 * Angle BAlso, the side opposite angle A (which is a) is 12 cm, and the side opposite angle B (which is b) is 8 cm. So, plugging these into the Law of Sines equation:12 / sin(2B) = 8 / sin BHmm, okay. Let me try to simplify this. I remember that sin(2B) is equal to 2 sin B cos B. So substituting that in:12 / (2 sin B cos B) = 8 / sin BSimplifying the left side:12 / (2 sin B cos B) = 6 / (sin B cos B)So now we have:6 / (sin B cos B) = 8 / sin BMultiply both sides by sin B cos B to eliminate denominators:6 = 8 cos BThen, solving for cos B:cos B = 6 / 8 = 3 / 4So cos B is 3/4. Therefore, angle B has a cosine of 3/4. Let me find sin B as well since we might need it for other parts. Using the Pythagorean identity:sin² B + cos² B = 1sin² B = 1 - (3/4)² = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16So sin B = sqrt(7/16) = sqrt7 / 4Now, angle A is 2B, so angle A = 2B. Then, the third angle, angle C, can be found since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees (or π radians). So:Angle C = π - A - B = π - 2B - B = π - 3BBut maybe I should work in radians or keep it in terms of sine and cosine. Hmm, perhaps we can find angle C in terms of B as well. But maybe instead of working with angles directly, use the Law of Sines again to find the third side. Let me denote the third side as c, which is opposite angle C.From the Law of Sines, we have:12 / sin(2B) = 8 / sin B = c / sin CWe already know sin B = sqrt7 / 4 and cos B = 3/4. So sin(2B) is 2 sin B cos B, which we calculated earlier as 2*(sqrt7/4)*(3/4) = 6 sqrt7 / 16 = 3 sqrt7 / 8So 12 / (3 sqrt7 / 8) = 12 * (8 / 3 sqrt7) = (96 / 3 sqrt7) = 32 / sqrt7Similarly, 8 / sin B = 8 / (sqrt7 / 4) = 8 * (4 / sqrt7) = 32 / sqrt7So both ratios equal 32 / sqrt7, which checks out.Now, we need to find c, the third side. Using the same ratio:c / sin C = 32 / sqrt7So c = (32 / sqrt7) * sin CBut we need to find sin C. Since angle C = π - 3B, sin C = sin(π - 3B) = sin(3B). Because sin(π - x) = sin x.So sin C = sin(3B). Now, we need to compute sin(3B). To do this, I can use the sine of triple angle formula. Recall that:sin(3θ) = 3 sin θ - 4 sin³ θSo, sin(3B) = 3 sin B - 4 sin³ BWe already know sin B = sqrt7 / 4. Let me compute sin³ B:(sin B)^3 = (sqrt7 / 4)^3 = 7 sqrt7 / 64Therefore:sin(3B) = 3*(sqrt7 / 4) - 4*(7 sqrt7 / 64)Simplify each term:First term: 3*(sqrt7 / 4) = 3 sqrt7 / 4Second term: 4*(7 sqrt7 / 64) = (28 sqrt7) / 64 = 7 sqrt7 / 16So sin(3B) = 3 sqrt7 / 4 - 7 sqrt7 / 16 = (12 sqrt7 - 7 sqrt7) / 16 = 5 sqrt7 / 16Therefore, sin C = sin(3B) = 5 sqrt7 / 16Now, substitute back into the expression for c:c = (32 / sqrt7) * (5 sqrt7 / 16)Simplify:(32 / sqrt7) * (5 sqrt7 / 16) = (32 * 5 * sqrt7) / (16 * sqrt7)The sqrt7 cancels out, and 32/16 = 2, so:2 * 5 = 10Therefore, c = 10 cmWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, verifying sin(3B):Used the formula sin(3B) = 3 sin B - 4 sin³ Bsin B = sqrt7 / 4, so sin³ B = 7 sqrt7 / 64Therefore:3 sin B = 3*(sqrt7 / 4) = 3 sqrt7 / 44 sin³ B = 4*(7 sqrt7 / 64) = 28 sqrt7 / 64 = 7 sqrt7 / 16Subtracting: 3 sqrt7 / 4 - 7 sqrt7 / 16Convert to sixteenths: 12 sqrt7 / 16 - 7 sqrt7 / 16 = 5 sqrt7 / 16. Correct.Then, c = (32 / sqrt7) * (5 sqrt7 / 16)Multiplying:32 / sqrt7 * 5 sqrt7 / 16 = (32 * 5) / 16 * (sqrt7 / sqrt7) = (160 /16) * 1 = 10 * 1 = 10 cm. Correct.Therefore, the third side is 10 cm. That seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines to verify. Let's see.Alternatively, once I know angle B, perhaps I can compute the sides. Let's see.We found cos B = 3/4, so angle B is arccos(3/4). Then angle A is 2B. Then angle C is 180 - 3B degrees.Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines on side c.Wait, maybe using Law of Cosines on one of the sides. Let's see.But since we already have the answer via Law of Sines, let me check via Law of Cosines.Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on angle C.But angle C is 180 - 3B. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe use Law of Cosines on angle A or B.Alternatively, using Law of Cosines on angle A: which is 2B, opposite side 12.Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos ASo 12² = 8² + c² - 2*8*c*cos(2B)We know cos(2B) can be expressed in terms of cos B. Since cos(2B) = 2 cos² B - 1. We found cos B = 3/4, so:cos(2B) = 2*(3/4)^2 - 1 = 2*(9/16) - 1 = 18/16 - 1 = 2/16 = 1/8Wait, that's 18/16 - 16/16 = 2/16 = 1/8. So cos(2B) = 1/8.Therefore, substituting into Law of Cosines equation:144 = 64 + c² - 2*8*c*(1/8)Simplify:144 = 64 + c² - (16c)*(1/8)Wait, 2*8*c = 16c, multiplied by 1/8, so 16c*(1/8) = 2cSo:144 = 64 + c² - 2cRearranged:c² - 2c + 64 - 144 = 0c² - 2c - 80 = 0Solving quadratic equation:c = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 320)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(324)] / 2 = [2 ± 18] / 2Since length can't be negative:c = (2 + 18)/2 = 20/2 = 10 cmSame result! So that confirms the answer is 10 cm. So even using Law of Cosines, we get c = 10 cm. Therefore, the third side is 10 cm.I think that's solid. Both methods give the same answer, so I can be confident that 10 cm is correct.Final AnswerThe length of the third side is boxed{10} centimeters.</think>Given triangle (ABC) where angle (A) is twice angle (B), and the sides opposite these angles are 12 cm and 8 cm respectively, we need to find the length of the third side.Using the Law of Sines:[frac{12}{sin(2B)} = frac{8}{sin B}]Since (sin(2B) = 2 sin B cos B), we substitute:[frac{12}{2 sin B cos B} = frac{8}{sin B}]Simplifying, we get:[frac{6}{sin B cos B} = frac{8}{sin B}]Solving for (cos B):[6 = 8 cos B implies cos B = frac{3}{4}]Using the Pythagorean identity to find (sin B):[sin^2 B = 1 - cos^2 B = 1 - left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 = frac{7}{16} implies sin B = frac{sqrt{7}}{4}]Next, we use the Law of Sines again to find the third side (c).

Below, we prove that the original problem has no other solutions.Assume (a, n)(n geqslant 2) is a solution to the original problem, then there must exist a positive integer k such that (a+1)^{n}-a^{n}=k n.Since a+1 and a are coprime, it follows from the above equation that n is coprime with both a and a+1.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what this means. For each positive integer n, we need to find a positive integer a such that when we compute (a+1)^n - a^n, the result is divisible by n. First, maybe I should try plugging in some small values of n and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture. Let's start with n=1. If n=1, then the expression becomes ((a+1) - a)/1 = 1/1 = 1, which is an integer. So for n=1, any positive integer a will work. So all pairs (a, 1) are solutions. That's straightforward.Now let's check n=2. The expression becomes ((a+1)^2 - a^2)/2. Expanding (a+1)^2 gives a^2 + 2a + 1, so subtracting a^2 leaves 2a + 1. So (2a + 1)/2 must be an integer. Therefore, 2a + 1 must be even. But 2a is even, so 2a + 1 is odd, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, there are no solutions when n=2. Wait, that's interesting. So for n=2, no matter what a we pick, (a+1)^2 - a^2 is always odd, hence dividing by 2 can't give an integer. Therefore, no solutions for n=2.Moving on to n=3. Let's compute ((a+1)^3 - a^3)/3. Expanding (a+1)^3: a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1. Subtract a^3: 3a^2 + 3a + 1. So the expression is (3a^2 + 3a + 1)/3 = a^2 + a + 1/3. For this to be an integer, the 1/3 must be canceled out, but a^2 + a is an integer, so 1/3 added to an integer can't be an integer. Therefore, there are no solutions for n=3 either.Hmm, n=4 then. Let's compute ((a+1)^4 - a^4)/4. Expanding (a+1)^4: a^4 + 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. Subtract a^4: 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. Dividing by 4: (4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1)/4 = a^3 + (3/2)a^2 + a + 1/4. Again, this sum would not be an integer unless the fractional parts cancel out. Let's see: a^3 and a are integers. Then (3/2)a^2 is either an integer or a half-integer, depending on whether a is even or odd. Then adding 1/4 to that. For example, if a is even, say a=2k, then (3/2)(4k^2) = 6k^2, which is an integer. Then 6k^2 + 1/4, which is not an integer. If a is odd, a=2k+1, then (3/2)(4k^2 + 4k + 1) = 6k^2 + 6k + 3/2. Then adding 1/4 gives 6k^2 + 6k + 3/2 + 1/4 = 6k^2 + 6k + 7/4, which is still not an integer. Therefore, n=4 has no solutions.Hmm, maybe n=5? Let's try. ((a+1)^5 - a^5)/5. Expanding (a+1)^5: a^5 + 5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1. Subtract a^5: 5a^4 + 10a^3 + 10a^2 + 5a + 1. Divided by 5: a^4 + 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a + 1/5. Again, the 1/5 term makes this a non-integer, so no solutions for n=5.Wait a minute, so far, except for n=1, there are no solutions. Maybe n=1 is the only solution? But maybe there's a pattern here. Let's check n=6. Wait, but before that, let's think if there's a general approach.We need to have ((a+1)^n - a^n) divisible by n. Let's denote this expression as E = (a+1)^n - a^n. So E ≡ 0 mod n. Let's think about this congruence.By Fermat's little theorem, if n is prime, then for any integer a, (a+1)^n ≡ (a+1) mod n, and a^n ≡ a mod n. Therefore, E ≡ (a+1) - a = 1 mod n. Therefore, if n is prime, E ≡ 1 mod n, so E is congruent to 1 modulo n, which is not congruent to 0. Therefore, for prime n ≥ 2, there are no solutions. So primes greater than or equal to 2 cannot work. So that explains n=2,3,5, etc., which are primes, there are no solutions.But what about composite n? Let's check n=4, which is composite. We saw that for n=4, the expression is not an integer. Similarly, n=6. Let's compute E for n=6.((a+1)^6 - a^6)/6. Let's expand (a+1)^6: a^6 + 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1. Subtract a^6: 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a^3 + 15a^2 + 6a + 1. Divided by 6: a^5 + (15/6)a^4 + (20/6)a^3 + (15/6)a^2 + a + 1/6. Simplify: a^5 + (5/2)a^4 + (10/3)a^3 + (5/2)a^2 + a + 1/6. This is clearly a non-integer because of the fractional terms. So n=6 also has no solutions.Wait, maybe composite numbers have to satisfy certain conditions? Let's think. For example, n=1 is a special case. Maybe n must be a power of 2? Wait, n=2 had no solutions, n=4 had no solutions. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe n must be a Carmichael number? But even then, in our case, for composite n, even if n is a Carmichael number, which satisfies that for all integers a coprime to n, a^{n-1} ≡ 1 mod n. But how does that relate to our problem?Alternatively, perhaps we can use the lifting the exponent lemma (LTE). Let me recall. LTE is useful for finding the highest power of a prime dividing expressions like a^n - b^n. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.Alternatively, perhaps expand (a+1)^n using the binomial theorem. So (a+1)^n - a^n = sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k) a^{n - k}. So the expression is [sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k) a^{n - k}] / n. We need this sum to be divisible by n. So sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k) a^{n - k} ≡ 0 mod n.Note that C(n,1) = n, so the first term is n * a^{n - 1}, which is congruent to 0 mod n. The rest of the terms are C(n,k) a^{n - k} for k from 2 to n. So the entire sum is 0 mod n if and only if the sum of C(n,k) a^{n - k} for k=2 to n is congruent to 0 mod n. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that sum_{k=2}^n C(n,k) a^{n - k} ≡ 0 mod n. So perhaps for certain n, this sum is always 0 mod n regardless of a, but for others, it depends on a.But this seems complicated. Let's think again. For n=1, the sum is just 1, and divided by 1 is 1, which is okay. For prime n, as we saw, using Fermat's little theorem, E = (a+1)^n - a^n ≡ (a+1) - a = 1 mod n, so E ≡1 mod n, which is not 0. Therefore, primes cannot be solutions. So all primes are excluded. For composite n, maybe some composites can work? Let's see n=4. Let's compute the sum for n=4: sum_{k=1}^4 C(4,k) a^{4 -k} = 4a^3 + 6a^2 + 4a + 1. Divided by 4: a^3 + (3/2)a^2 + a + 1/4. Which is not an integer. Similarly for n=6, as above. So maybe n has to be 1? Wait, but the problem says positive integers, so a and n are positive integers. So n=1 is allowed, and any a is allowed. But maybe there are other solutions.Wait, let's test n=6 with specific a. Let's pick a=1. Then ((1+1)^6 -1^6)/6 = (64 -1)/6 = 63/6 = 10.5, which is not integer. If a=2, ((3)^6 - 2^6)/6 = (729 - 64)/6 = 665/6 ≈ 110.833, not integer. a=3: (4^6 -3^6)/6 = (4096 -729)/6 = 3367/6 ≈ 561.166, nope.Wait, maybe n=6 is not possible. How about n=9? Let's check n=9. For a=1: (2^9 -1^9)/9 = (512 -1)/9=511/9≈56.777, not integer. a=2: (3^9 -2^9)/9=(19683 -512)/9=19171/9≈2130.111, nope.Alternatively, maybe n needs to be a power of a prime? But n=4, which is 2^2, didn't work. Hmm.Wait, maybe n must be 1? But the problem says positive integer pairs, so n=1 is allowed, but maybe other n? Let's check n= p^k where p is prime. For example, n= p^2. Let's take p=2, n=4: no solution. p=3, n=9: also no solution. Maybe not.Alternatively, maybe n must be composite and satisfy some condition. Let's think about the case when a=1. Then the expression becomes (2^n -1)/n. So (2^n -1)/n must be integer. Such numbers n are called Wieferich primes base 2, but actually, Wieferich primes satisfy 2^{p-1} ≡1 mod p^2. But here we need n divides 2^n -1. For example, n=1 works. n=341 is a pseudoprime to base 2, since 2^340 ≡1 mod 341. But 2^341 -1 ≡2 -1=1 mod 341, so (2^341 -1)/341 ≡1/341 mod 1, which is not an integer. Wait, maybe n divides 2^n -1. The numbers for which n divides 2^n -1 are called Wieferich numbers. For example, 1, 3, ... Let's check n=3: (2^3 -1)/3=7/3≈2.333, not integer. Wait, no. So maybe n divides 2^n -1 only when n=1? Wait, 2^1 -1=1, which is divisible by 1. For n=2: 3/2 not integer. n=3:7/3≈2.333. n=4:15/4≈3.75. n=5:31/5=6.2. n=6:63/6=10.5, not integer. Wait, but 341 is a pseudoprime. Wait, 2^340 ≡1 mod 341, so 2^341 ≡2 mod 341, so 2^341 -1 ≡1 mod 341, so (2^341 -1)/341 ≡1/341 mod 1, which is still not an integer. So maybe no n>1 such that n divides 2^n -1. Then, if a=1, only n=1 works. Therefore, if we set a=1, only n=1 works. Similarly, maybe other a's?Let's pick a=2 and n=1: (3^1 -2^1)/1=1, integer. For n=2: (3^2 -2^2)/2=(9-4)/2=5/2=2.5, not integer. For n=3: (3^3 -2^3)/3=(27-8)/3=19/3≈6.333, not integer. So n=1 is the only solution for a=2.Wait, but maybe there's a specific a and n where ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is integer. For example, take a= n-1. Let's see, if a =n-1. Then the expression becomes (n^{n} - (n-1)^n)/n. Let's compute this. For example, take n=1: a=0, but a must be positive. So n=2: a=1. Then (2^2 -1^2)/2= (4-1)/2=1.5, not integer. n=3: a=2: (3^3 -2^3)/3=(27-8)/3=19/3≈6.333, not integer. n=4: a=3: (4^4 -3^4)/4=(256-81)/4=175/4=43.75, not integer. So that approach doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe a is a multiple of n. Let's suppose a=kn for some integer k. Then (kn +1)^n - (kn)^n. Let's expand (kn +1)^n using the binomial theorem. The expansion is sum_{m=0}^n C(n,m)(kn)^{n -m}(1)^m. So subtracting (kn)^n gives sum_{m=1}^n C(n,m)(kn)^{n -m}. Then divide by n: sum_{m=1}^n C(n,m)(kn)^{n -m}/n.But (kn)^{n -m}/n = k^{n -m}n^{n -m -1}. Hmm, not sure. Let's take m=1 term: C(n,1)(kn)^{n -1}/n = n*(kn)^{n-1}/n = (kn)^{n -1}. For m=2: C(n,2)(kn)^{n -2}/n. So this is [n(n-1)/2](kn)^{n-2}/n = [(n-1)/2](kn)^{n -2}. Similarly, for higher m. So each term after dividing by n is an integer, except maybe when m divides into the coefficients. Wait, but if a is a multiple of n, then each term here is an integer. Therefore, the entire expression would be an integer. Therefore, if a is a multiple of n, then ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is an integer. Wait, is that true?Wait, let's test with n=1. If n=1, then a= k*1= k. Then ((k+1)^1 -k^1)/1 =1, which is integer. So that works. For n=2, suppose a=2k. Then ((2k+1)^2 - (2k)^2)/2=(4k^2 +4k +1 -4k^2)/2=(4k +1)/2=2k + 0.5, which is not an integer. So even if a is a multiple of n=2, the expression is not an integer. So my previous reasoning was incorrect.Wait, but why? Let's check n=3. If a=3k, then ((3k +1)^3 - (3k)^3)/3. Let's compute that. (27k^3 + 27k^2 + 9k +1 -27k^3)/3=(27k^2 +9k +1)/3=9k^2 +3k + 1/3. Which is not an integer. So that approach doesn't work. Therefore, even if a is a multiple of n, the expression may not be an integer. Therefore, my previous assumption was wrong.Wait, perhaps more conditions are needed. Let's see. If a ≡ -1 mod n, then (a+1) ≡0 mod n. Therefore, (a+1)^n ≡0 mod n^n, but a ≡-1 mod n, so a = mn -1 for some m. Then (a+1)^n = (mn)^n, which is divisible by n^n, and a^n = (mn -1)^n. Then (a+1)^n -a^n = (mn)^n - (mn -1)^n. Let's compute this. Expanding (mn -1)^n using the binomial theorem: sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k)(mn)^{n -k}(-1)^k. Therefore, (mn)^n - (mn -1)^n = sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k)(mn)^{n -k}(-1)^{k+1}. Then divided by n: sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k)(mn)^{n -k}(-1)^{k+1}/n.Each term in the sum is C(n,k)(mn)^{n -k}(-1)^{k+1}/n. Let's factor out n^{n -k -1} from each term. Wait, mn is m times n, so (mn)^{n -k} = m^{n -k}n^{n -k}. Then dividing by n gives m^{n -k}n^{n -k -1}. Therefore, each term is C(n,k) * m^{n -k} * n^{n -k -1} * (-1)^{k+1}. For n >= 2, and k >=1, n^{n -k -1} is an integer (since n -k -1 >=0 when k <=n -1). For k=n, we have C(n,n)(mn)^{0}(-1)^{n+1}/n = (-1)^{n+1}/n. But for k=n, that term is (-1)^{n+1}/n, which is not an integer unless n=1. Therefore, except when n=1, the last term in the sum is fractional. Therefore, even if a ≡-1 mod n, unless n=1, the expression ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n will have a fractional component. Therefore, this approach also does not yield solutions for n>1.Hmm, so maybe n=1 is the only possible solution? But the problem says \\"positive integer pairs (a, n)\\", so n=1 is allowed, and for n=1, any a is allowed. But maybe there are other solutions. Wait, let's check n=6 and a=7. Let me compute ((7+1)^6 -7^6)/6. 8^6=262144, 7^6=117649. 262144 -117649=144495. 144495 divided by 6=24082.5, not integer. How about a=3, n=1: works. a=5, n=1: works. Maybe n=1 is the only solution. But the problem is from the National Training Team Test, so perhaps there's more to it.Wait, maybe there are other solutions where n is a prime power? Let's test n=4 and a=1. ((1+1)^4 -1^4)/4=(16 -1)/4=15/4=3.75, not integer. n=8, a=1: (2^8 -1)/8=255/8=31.875, not integer. How about n=6 and a= some value? Let's take a=7, n=6: as above, 144495/6=24082.5, no. How about a= n-1. Let me try n=5, a=4. ((5)^5 -4^5)/5=(3125 -1024)/5=2101/5=420.2, not integer.Wait, perhaps a=2, n=1: works. a=3, n=1: works. But n=1 is trivial. Maybe the problem is looking for n>1. Wait, the problem says \\"positive integer pairs\\", so n=1 is allowed, but maybe there are more.Wait, let's check n=0, but n must be positive. So n=1 is okay.Alternatively, maybe there are solutions where a+1 is divisible by n. Let me suppose that a+1 ≡0 mod n, i.e., a = kn -1 for some k. Then (a+1)^n = (kn)^n, which is divisible by n^n. Then (kn)^n - (kn -1)^n divided by n. Similar to earlier approach, but again, we saw that there's a term (-1)^{n+1}/n which complicates things.Alternatively, maybe if n is a power of 2, but we saw n=2 and n=4 don't work.Wait, let's try n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. We saw that n=1 works. For n=2 to 10, no solutions. So maybe n=1 is the only solution. But let me think again.Wait, suppose n is even. Then, as in n=2,4,6, we saw that the expression is not an integer. For odd composite n, like n=9, also doesn't work. What if n=1?Alternatively, perhaps for n being a Carmichael number, which satisfies Korselt's criterion: n is square-free and for all prime divisors p of n, p-1 divides n-1. For example, 561 is a Carmichael number. Let's check n=561 and a=1. Compute (2^561 -1)/561. But this is a huge number. However, by Korselt's criterion, since 561 is a Carmichael number, for any a coprime to 561, a^560 ≡1 mod 561. Therefore, 2^560 ≡1 mod 561, so 2^561 ≡2 mod 561. Therefore, (2^561 -1) ≡1 mod 561, so (2^561 -1)/561 ≡1/561 mod 1, which is not an integer. Therefore, even for Carmichael numbers, it's not working.Therefore, perhaps the only solution is n=1, any positive integer a. But let's check one more example. Let me pick a=1 and n=1: (2^1 -1)/1=1, integer. a=1, n=2: (2^2 -1)/2=3/2, not integer. a=1, n=3:7/3≈2.333. a=1, n=4:15/4=3.75. So nope.Wait, but the problem states \\"positive integer pairs (a, n)\\", so maybe n=1 is the only solution. But I need to confirm. Let me check a different approach. Suppose n>1. We need (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n. Let’s write this as (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n. Let’s subtract a^n from both sides: (a+1)^n -a^n ≡0 mod n. For n prime, as before, using Fermat's little theorem, (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n, and a^n ≡a mod n. Therefore, (a+1) -a ≡1 mod n, so 1≡0 mod n, which is impossible. Therefore, for prime n>1, no solution.For composite n, perhaps we can have (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n. Let's assume that n is composite. Let’s pick a such that a ≡ -1 mod n. Then a+1 ≡0 mod n. Therefore, (a+1)^n ≡0 mod n, and a ≡-1 mod n. Then a^n ≡(-1)^n mod n. So 0 - (-1)^n ≡0 mod n. Therefore, (-1)^{n+1} ≡0 mod n. Which would require that (-1)^{n+1} ≡0 mod n. Since n>1, this is impossible because (-1)^{n+1} is either 1 or -1, neither of which is 0 mod n. Therefore, such a cannot satisfy the condition.Alternatively, take a ≡0 mod n. Then a+1 ≡1 mod n. Then (a+1)^n ≡1^n=1 mod n, and a^n ≡0 mod n. Therefore, 1 -0 ≡1 mod n≡0 mod n. Thus, 1≡0 mod n, which is impossible. Therefore, a ≡0 mod n also does not work.Alternatively, take a ≡1 mod n. Then a+1≡2 mod n. So (a+1)^n ≡2^n mod n, and a^n ≡1 mod n. Therefore, 2^n -1 ≡0 mod n. So n divides 2^n -1. Such numbers are called Wieferich numbers, but as before, only n=1 satisfies this trivially, and other known Wieferich numbers are 1093, 3511, etc. Let's check n=341, which is a pseudoprime. 2^340 ≡1 mod 341, so 2^341 ≡2 mod 341. Thus, 2^341 -1 ≡1 mod 341, so 341 does not divide 2^341 -1. So even pseudoprimes don't work. Therefore, no known composite numbers n>1 satisfy n divides 2^n -1. So this approach also fails.Therefore, perhaps n=1 is the only solution. But let's see. Suppose n is a Carmichael number and a is such that a+1 and a are both coprime to n. Then, since n is Carmichael, (a+1)^{n-1} ≡1 mod n, and a^{n-1} ≡1 mod n. Therefore, (a+1)^n ≡(a+1) mod n, and a^n≡a mod n. Therefore, (a+1) -a ≡1 mod n, so again 1≡0 mod n, which is impossible. Thus, even for Carmichael numbers, this approach does not yield solutions.Alternatively, suppose n is a power of 2. Let's take n=8. Let’s pick a=7. Then ((8)^8 -7^8)/8. 8^8=16777216, 7^8=5764801. Difference=16777216 -5764801=11012415. Divided by 8=1376551.875, not integer. Similarly, a=15, n=16: ((16)^16 -15^16)/16. Obviously, this will be huge, but since 15 ≡-1 mod 16, (16)^16=0 mod16, 15^16=(-1)^16=1 mod16. So 0 -1 =-1 mod16. Thus, the difference is -1 mod16, which means the expression is (-1)/16 mod1, not integer. So even powers of 2 don't work.Alternatively, perhaps n divides (a+1 -a)=1. Which is only possible if n=1. Thus, for n>1, n cannot divide 1, so no solutions. Wait, but (a+1)^n -a^n is not 1 in general. But for prime n, as we saw, it's congruent to 1 modn. For composite n, it can be different. But even for composite n, we need the entire expression (a+1)^n -a^n to be divisible by n. But how?Wait, perhaps consider specific composite n. Take n=4. Let’s pick a=3. Then ((4)^4 -3^4)/4=(256 -81)/4=175/4=43.75, not integer. a=5. ((6)^4 -5^4)/4=(1296 -625)/4=671/4=167.75, not integer. How about n=6, a=7: as above, 144495/6=24082.5, not integer.Wait, let's consider n= p^2, where p is prime. Let’s take p=3, n=9. Let’s pick a=8. Then ((9)^9 -8^9)/9. 9^9 is 387,420,489. 8^9=134,217,728. Difference=253,202,761. Divided by 9≈28,133,640.111, not integer. So nope.Alternatively, maybe take n= arbitrary composite and a=1. Then ((2)^n -1)/n. For n=4:15/4=3.75; n=6:63/6=10.5; n=8:255/8=31.875; n=9:511/9≈56.777. All non-integers. If n=341: as before, (2^341 -1)/341 is not integer.Alternatively, maybe take a= n. Then (n+1)^n -n^n. Divided by n. Let's compute modulo n. (n+1)^n ≡1^n=1 modn. And n^n ≡0 modn. Therefore, (n+1)^n -n^n ≡1 -0=1 modn. Therefore, ((n+1)^n -n^n)/n ≡1/n mod1. Which is not 0 unless n=1. So even for a=n, the expression is not integer.Alternatively, maybe take a= (n-1)/2. But a must be integer, so n must be odd. Let’s try n=5, a=2. ((3)^5 -2^5)/5=(243 -32)/5=211/5=42.2, not integer. n=7, a=3: (4^7 -3^7)/7=(16384 -2187)/7=14197/7=2028.142..., not integer.Hmm. I'm starting to think that n=1 is the only solution. But let me check another angle.Suppose n is even. Then, in the expansion of (a+1)^n -a^n, all terms except the last term (1) will have even coefficients. Wait, for even n, the expansion is (a+1)^n -a^n = sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k)a^{n -k}. The coefficients C(n,k) for even n. For example, n=2: coefficients 2,1. n=4: coefficients 4,6,4,1. So, when n is even, the coefficients are even except for the last term, which is 1. Therefore, the entire sum is even*a^{n-1} + even*a^{n-2} + ... + even*a + 1. Therefore, if n is even, the sum is odd. Therefore, ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is odd/n. For even n>=2, odd/n is not an integer. Therefore, for even n>=2, no solutions. Hence, all even n>=2 are ruled out.For odd n>1, let's see. Let's take n=9. Then ((a+1)^9 -a^9)/9. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is sum_{k=1}^9 C(9,k)a^{9 -k}. The first term is 9a^8, which is divisible by 9. Then the rest of the terms: C(9,2)a^7 + ... + C(9,8)a +1. So the sum becomes 9a^8 + 36a^7 + 84a^6 + 126a^5 + 126a^4 +84a^3 +36a^2 +9a +1. Divided by 9: a^8 +4a^7 + 84/9 a^6 +14a^5 +14a^4 + 84/9 a^3 +4a^2 +a +1/9. Hmm, fractions here. For example, 84/9=28/3, which is not an integer. Similarly, 1/9. Therefore, the expression is not an integer.Wait, but maybe specific a can make the fractions cancel out. For example, if a is a multiple of 3, then 28/3 a^6 would be integer if a is a multiple of 3. Let's test a=3. Then compute each term:a^8 =3^8=65614a^7=4*3^7=4*2187=874828/3 a^6=28/3*729=28*243=680414a^5=14*243=340214a^4=14*81=113428/3 a^3=28/3*27=2524a^2=4*9=36a=31/9=1/9Adding them up: 6561 +8748=15309; +6804=22113; +3402=25515; +1134=26649; +252=26901; +36=26937; +3=26940; +1/9≈26940.111. Not an integer. So even with a=3, the fractions don't cancel.Therefore, even if a is chosen to be a multiple of the denominator in the fractional coefficients, the final term 1/9 remains, making the total non-integer. Therefore, even for odd composite n, there are no solutions.Therefore, combining all these observations: For n=1, any a is allowed. For n>1, regardless of being prime or composite, there are no solutions. Hence, the only positive integer pairs (a, n) are those with n=1 and any positive integer a.Final AnswerAll positive integer pairs are those with ( n = 1 ). Thus, the solutions are (boxed{(a, 1)}) for any positive integer ( a ).</think>To find all positive integer pairs ((a, n)) such that (frac{(a+1)^n - a^n}{n}) is an integer, we start by analyzing small values of (n) and then generalize.1. Case (n = 1):   - The expression simplifies to (frac{(a+1)^1 - a^1}{1} = 1), which is always an integer. Therefore, any positive integer (a) paired with (n = 1) is a solution.2. Case (n = 2):   - The expression becomes (frac{(a+1)^2 - a^2}{2} = frac{2a + 1}{2}). This is not an integer since (2a + 1) is odd.3. Case (n = 3):   - The expression becomes (frac{(a+1)^3 - a^3}{3} = frac{3a^2 + 3a + 1}{3}). This simplifies to (a^2 + a + frac{1}{3}), which is not an integer.4. General Case for Prime (n):   - Using Fermat's Little Theorem, for a prime (n), ((a+1)^n equiv a+1 pmod{n}) and (a^n equiv a pmod{n}). Thus, ((a+1)^n - a^n equiv 1 pmod{n}), which is not divisible by (n).5. Composite (n):   - For composite (n), we checked several values (e.g., (n = 4, 6, 8, 9)) and found that the expression (frac{(a+1)^n - a^n}{n}) involves fractional terms that do not cancel out, making the result non-integer.6. General Analysis:   - For even (n geq 2), the expression results in an odd number divided by an even number, which is non-integer.   - For odd composite (n), the expression involves fractional terms that do not cancel out, even with specific choices of (a).After thorough analysis, we conclude that the only solutions occur when (n = 1). For (n = 1), any positive integer (a) satisfies the condition.[boxed{(a, 1)}] for any positive integer (a).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem: Find all positive integer pairs (a, n) such that ((a+1)^n - a^n)/n is an integer. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let's parse the problem. We need both a and n to be positive integers, and when we compute (a+1)^n - a^n, then divide by n, the result should also be an integer. So, n divides (a+1)^n - a^n. My goal is to find all such pairs (a, n).Maybe I can start by looking at small values of n and see if I can spot a pattern or find some conditions on a. Let's try n=1 first.For n=1: The expression becomes ((a+1)^1 - a^1)/1 = (a + 1 - a)/1 = 1/1 = 1, which is an integer. So for n=1, any positive integer a will work. Therefore, all pairs (a, 1) are solutions. That seems straightforward.Next, n=2: Let's compute ((a+1)^2 - a^2)/2. Expanding (a+1)^2 gives a² + 2a + 1. Subtracting a² leaves 2a + 1. Then divide by 2: (2a + 1)/2. For this to be an integer, 2a + 1 must be even. But 2a is even, so 2a + 1 is odd. An odd number divided by 2 can't be an integer. Therefore, there are no solutions when n=2. So n=2 is out.Moving on to n=3: Compute ((a+1)^3 - a³)/3. Expanding (a+1)^3: a³ + 3a² + 3a + 1. Subtract a³: 3a² + 3a + 1. Divide by 3: (3a² + 3a + 1)/3 = a² + a + 1/3. Hmm, the 1/3 is problematic. For the entire expression to be an integer, 1/3 must be canceled out, but there's no term in a² or a that can do that. So unless 1/3 is an integer, which it isn't, there are no solutions for n=3 either. So n=3 doesn't work.n=4: Let's do the same. ((a+1)^4 - a^4)/4. Expand (a+1)^4: a⁴ + 4a³ + 6a² + 4a + 1. Subtract a⁴: 4a³ + 6a² + 4a + 1. Divide by 4: (4a³ + 6a² + 4a + 1)/4 = a³ + (3/2)a² + a + 1/4. Again, fractions here. The (3/2)a² and 1/4 terms mean unless a is such that those fractions become integers, which seems unlikely for general a. Let's check specific a's. For a=1: (2^4 - 1^4)/4 = (16 - 1)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75, not integer. a=2: (3^4 - 2^4)/4 = (81 - 16)/4 = 65/4 = 16.25, not integer. a=3: (4^4 - 3^4)/4 = (256 - 81)/4 = 175/4 = 43.75, nope. Seems like no solutions here either. So n=4 is out.n=5: Maybe similar issues. Let's check. ((a+1)^5 - a^5)/5. Expansion: (a^5 + 5a^4 + 10a³ + 10a² + 5a + 1 - a^5)/5 = (5a^4 + 10a³ + 10a² + 5a + 1)/5 = a^4 + 2a³ + 2a² + a + 1/5. Again, the 1/5 term is a problem. So unless 1/5 is canceled out, which would require the other terms to sum to an integer minus 1/5, but all other terms are integers, so the total is integer + 1/5, which is not integer. Thus, n=5 also has no solutions.Hmm, so n=1 works for any a, but n=2,3,4,5 don't work. Maybe n=1 is the only solution? But that seems too easy, and the problem is from a national training team test, so probably there are more solutions. Maybe I missed something.Wait, perhaps there are specific a's for higher n that make the expression integer. Let's check n=6. For n=6, ((a+1)^6 - a^6)/6. Let's compute:(a+1)^6 = a^6 + 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a³ + 15a² + 6a + 1. Subtract a^6: 6a^5 + 15a^4 + 20a³ + 15a² + 6a + 1. Divide by 6: a^5 + (15/6)a^4 + (20/6)a³ + (15/6)a² + a + 1/6. Simplify fractions: a^5 + (5/2)a^4 + (10/3)a³ + (5/2)a² + a + 1/6. This is a mix of fractions with denominators 2, 3, and 6. To have the entire expression integer, all the fractional parts must sum to an integer. Let's check for specific a's.Take a=1: ((2)^6 -1^6)/6 = (64 -1)/6 = 63/6 = 10.5, not integer. a=2: (3^6 - 2^6)/6 = (729 - 64)/6 = 665/6 ≈ 110.833, not integer. a=3: (4^6 - 3^6)/6 = (4096 - 729)/6 = 3367/6 ≈ 561.166, nope. a=6: Maybe? Let's see. (7^6 -6^6)/6. 7^6=117649, 6^6=46656, difference=711, divide by 6: 711/6=118.5. Not integer. Hmm. Maybe a=5? (6^6 -5^6)/6=(46656 - 15625)/6=(31031)/6≈5171.83, nope. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe n needs to be a prime number? Wait, n=1 is a unit, not prime. For primes p>2, we saw n=3,5, which didn't work. Wait, but perhaps using some number theory here.Alternatively, consider modulo n. The expression ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n must be an integer. So, (a+1)^n ≡ a^n mod n. Because if n divides (a+1)^n -a^n, then (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n. So, maybe we can use Fermat's little theorem here. If n is prime, then (a+1)^n ≡ a+1 mod n, and a^n ≡a mod n. Therefore, (a+1) - a ≡1 mod n. So, 1 ≡0 mod n. Which implies that n divides 1. But n is a positive integer greater than 1 (since n=1 is already handled), so no solutions when n is prime. Therefore, if n is prime, there are no solutions except n=1. Wait, so primes cannot be n? Except n=1, which is not prime. So primes are excluded. So maybe composite numbers?Wait, but n=4 is composite, but we saw that it didn't work either. So maybe n has to be a composite number with certain properties.Alternatively, perhaps n is a power of 2? Let's test n=4 again. Wait, we tried n=4 and saw that even a=1 gives 15/4, which isn't integer. So n=4 doesn't work. Maybe n=6? Tried that too, didn't work. Hmm.Wait, let's try n= some composite number, say n=6. Wait, already tried n=6. Alternatively, maybe n is a Carmichael number? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the expression (a+1)^n - a^n is divisible by n. So perhaps using the lifting the exponent lemma or other divisibility techniques.Alternatively, think about the binomial theorem. Expand (a+1)^n as a^n + C(n,1)a^{n-1} + C(n,2)a^{n-2} + ... + 1. Therefore, (a+1)^n -a^n = C(n,1)a^{n-1} + C(n,2)a^{n-2} + ... + 1. So the expression is [C(n,1)a^{n-1} + C(n,2)a^{n-2} + ... + 1]/n. We need this sum divided by n to be integer.So, perhaps each term in the sum must be divisible by n, or their sum is divisible by n. Let's see. The first term is C(n,1)a^{n-1} = n a^{n-1}, so divided by n gives a^{n-1}, which is integer. The second term is C(n,2)a^{n-2} = [n(n-1)/2]a^{n-2}. Divided by n gives [(n-1)/2]a^{n-2}. So for the entire expression to be integer, each term after the first must contribute an integer when divided by n. Wait, but the entire sum divided by n must be integer, not necessarily each term. So maybe their sum is divisible by n.So, let's denote S = sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k) a^{n -k} = (a+1)^n - a^n. Then S/n must be integer. So S ≡0 mod n. Therefore, (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n^2? Wait, no. Wait, S = (a+1)^n - a^n ≡0 mod n. But we need S/n ≡0 mod 1, i.e., S ≡0 mod n. But actually, S is already ≡0 mod n, because (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n and a^n ≡a mod n (if n is prime, by Fermat's little theorem). Then (a+1)^n -a^n ≡ (a +1 -a) =1 mod n. So 1 ≡0 mod n, which is only possible if n=1. Which matches our previous result that for prime n, only n=1 works. But if n is composite, maybe (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n and a^n ≡a mod n as well, if n is a Carmichael number. Wait, for composite numbers, Carmichael numbers satisfy x^n ≡x mod n for all x. So if n is a Carmichael number, then (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n and a^n ≡a mod n. Therefore, (a+1)^n -a^n ≡ (a+1 -a)=1 mod n. Again, 1 ≡0 mod n, which requires n divides 1, so n=1. So even for Carmichael numbers, only n=1 works. Therefore, regardless of n being prime or composite, except n=1, we have that (a+1)^n -a^n ≡1 mod n, so 1 ≡0 mod n, which is impossible. Therefore, the only solution is n=1. Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement because the problem is from a national training team test, so maybe expecting more.Wait, but maybe my reasoning is flawed. Let's check again.If n is prime, then by Fermat's little theorem, (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n and a^n ≡a mod n. Therefore, their difference is 1 mod n, so 1 ≡0 mod n, so n divides 1, impossible. So primes n>1 cannot be solutions.If n is composite, but not Carmichael, then maybe (a+1)^n ≡a+1 mod n and a^n ≡a mod n for some a. But unless n is a Carmichael number, which satisfies this for all a, but even then, as above, it leads to 1 ≡0 mod n. So even if n is Carmichael, same problem. Therefore, perhaps the only solution is n=1.But then, in the example above, when n=1, the expression is ((a+1) -a)/1 =1, which is integer, so all pairs (a,1) are solutions. But the problem says \\"positive integer pairs (a,n)\\", so n=1, any a. But maybe the problem expects more solutions? Maybe I missed something here.Wait, let's check n=1: works for any a. Now, let's check a=1, n arbitrary. Let’s see if a=1 gives solutions for some n>1. For a=1, the expression is (2^n -1)/n. So when is (2^n -1) divisible by n? Let's check n=1: yes, 1 divides 1. n=2: (4-1)/2=3/2, not integer. n=3: (8-1)/3=7/3, nope. n=4: (16-1)/4=15/4, nope. n=5:31/5=6.2, nope. n=6:63/6=10.5, nope. n=7:127/7≈18.14, no. n=341: 2^341 -1 is divisible by 341? Wait, 341 is 11*31. Is 341 a pseudoprime to base 2? Yes, 2^10 ≡1 mod 11, so 2^340 ≡1 mod 11, and 2^30 ≡1 mod 31, so 2^340 ≡(2^30)^11*2^10 ≡1^11*1024 mod31. 1024 mod31: 31*33=1023, so 1024≡1 mod31. Thus, 2^340≡1 mod31. Therefore, 2^340 ≡1 mod341, so 2^341 ≡2 mod341. Therefore, 2^341 -1 ≡1 mod341, so 341 does not divide 2^341 -1. Thus, no. So maybe a=1 only works for n=1.Similarly, a=2: (3^n -2^n)/n. Let's check n=1: (3-2)/1=1, works. n=2: (9 -4)/2=5/2, nope. n=3: (27-8)/3=19/3, nope. n=4: (81 -16)/4=65/4, nope. n=5: (243 -32)/5=211/5=42.2, nope. So no luck.Alternatively, maybe a and n are related in some way. Let's suppose n is a power of 2. Let’s try n=2, but we saw that doesn't work. n=4, nope. Maybe a is of the form n-1? Let's try a= n-1. So (a+1)^n -a^n =n^n - (n-1)^n. Then divided by n: [n^n - (n-1)^n]/n =n^{n-1} - [(n-1)^n]/n. Hmm, but [(n-1)^n]/n is not necessarily integer. For example, n=2: [2² -1²]/2=(4 -1)/2=3/2, not integer. n=3: [3^3 -2^3]/3=(27 -8)/3=19/3, not integer. So that doesn't seem to help.Alternatively, perhaps n divides (a+1) -a=1, which is only possible if n=1. But that is trivial. Wait, but (a+1)^n -a^n is not linear, so maybe there's more to it. Wait, but when n=1, it's linear.Alternatively, suppose n is even. Then, (a+1)^n -a^n can be written as ( (a+1)^{n/2} -a^{n/2} )( (a+1)^{n/2} +a^{n/2} ). But not sure if that helps. For example, n=2: (a+1)^2 -a^2=(2a+1), which is odd, so not divisible by 2. For n=4: (a+1)^4 -a^4=(2a+1)(2a² + 2a +1). So divided by 4, we need (2a+1)(2a² +2a +1)/4. Since 2a+1 and 2a² +2a +1 are both odd, their product is odd, so divided by 4 would require the product to be divisible by 4, but it's odd, so not possible. Hence, n=4 also fails. So even for even n, seems tough.Alternatively, maybe n divides (a+1 -a) =1, which again only possible for n=1. Wait, but (a+1)^n -a^n is more complicated. However, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is sum_{k=1}^n C(n,k)a^{n -k}. So when we divide by n, it's sum_{k=1}^n [C(n,k)/n]a^{n -k}. For this to be integer, each term [C(n,k)/n]a^{n -k} must be integer, or their sum must be integer. But even if individual terms aren't integers, their sum could be. But how?For example, take n=1: [C(1,1)/1]a^{0}=1, integer. For n=2: [C(2,1)/2]a + [C(2,2)/2]1= (2/2)a + (1/2)=a +1/2. As before, not integer. For n=3: [C(3,1)/3]a² + [C(3,2)/3]a + [C(3,3)/3]1= (3/3)a² + (3/3)a +1/3= a² +a +1/3. Again, the 1/3 kills it. For n=4: [C(4,1)/4]a³ + [C(4,2)/4]a² + [C(4,3)/4]a + [C(4,4)/4]1= (4/4)a³ + (6/4)a² + (4/4)a +1/4= a³ + (3/2)a² + a +1/4. Again, fractions. For n=5: Each term would be C(5,k)/5*a^{5 -k}, leading to similar fractional issues.But perhaps for certain a, these fractions sum to an integer. For example, take n=3 and a=2: ((3)^3 -2^3)/3=(27 -8)/3=19/3≈6.333, not integer. a=3: (4^3 -3^3)/3=(64 -27)/3=37/3≈12.333, nope. a=5: (6^3 -5^3)/3=(216 -125)/3=91/3≈30.333, still no. a=6: (7^3 -6^3)/3=(343 -216)/3=127/3≈42.333. Hmm.Wait, but maybe for n= p^k, some prime power. Let’s suppose n= p. Wait, we tried primes. Not working.Alternatively, maybe n must divide a+1 -a=1, so only n=1. But that's trivial. Alternatively, consider writing the expression as ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n. If n divides this, then (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n^2? Because n divides the difference, so (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod n^2. Maybe using Hensel's lemma or something.Wait, expanding (a+1)^n using the binomial theorem up to higher terms. Let's suppose n is prime. Then (a+1)^n ≡a^n + C(n,1)a^{n-1} + 0 mod n^2, because the other terms have coefficients divisible by n^2. Wait, no, for prime p, (a+1)^p ≡a^p + 1 + p*a^{p-1} mod p^2. Similarly, a^p ≡a mod p. So, (a+1)^p ≡(a +1) + p*a^{p-1} mod p^2. Similarly, a^p ≡a mod p^2 if a is not divisible by p. So, the difference (a+1)^p -a^p ≡(a +1 + p*a^{p-1}) -a =1 +p*a^{p-1} mod p^2. So (a+1)^p -a^p ≡1 +p*a^{p-1} mod p^2. Then dividing by p: (1 +p*a^{p-1})/p =1/p +a^{p-1}. For this to be integer mod p, 1/p is not an integer. So even if we consider mod p, the term 1/p is undefined. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful.Alternatively, perhaps looking for n such that n divides (a+1)^n -a^n. For n>1, as we saw, in general, it's difficult. Maybe specific a's. Let's fix a and vary n.Take a=1: We need (2^n -1)/n integer. As before, n=1 works. Are there other n? Such numbers are called Wieferich primes base 2, but they are rare. Known Wieferich primes are 1093 and 3511, but they are primes. However, here n can be composite. The numbers n for which n divides 2^n -1 are called Wieferich numbers. For example, 341 is a pseudoprime to base 2, but does 341 divide 2^341 -1? Earlier, we saw 2^341 ≡2 mod 341, so 2^341 -1 ≡1 mod 341, so no. So 341 is not a Wieferich number. Are there composite numbers n where n divides 2^n -1? Let's check n=341: No. n=561: 561 is a Carmichael number. Let's see, 2^561 ≡2 mod 561, so 2^561 -1 ≡1 mod 561, so no. So perhaps there are no composite numbers n>1 for which n divides 2^n -1. Therefore, a=1 only gives n=1.Similarly, take a=2: (3^n -2^n)/n must be integer. Let's check n=1: works. n=5: (243 -32)/5=211/5, nope. n=4: (81 -16)/4=65/4, nope. n=5: no. n=6: (729 -64)/6=665/6≈110.833, nope. Maybe n= something else. Not sure. Alternatively, n=1 is the only solution here.Similarly for a=3: (4^n -3^n)/n. For n=1: works. n=2: (16 -9)/2=7/2, nope. n=3: (64 -27)/3=37/3≈12.333, nope. n=4: (256 -81)/4=175/4=43.75, nope. So again, nothing.Wait, maybe n divides (a+1)^n -a^n for some specific a and n. For example, take a= n= k. Let’s see if a=k and n=k works. For example, a=1, n=1: works. a=2, n=2: (3^2 -2^2)/2=(9-4)/2=5/2, nope. a=3, n=3: (4^3 -3^3)/3= (64-27)/3=37/3≈12.333, nope. Doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe a=2, n= some other number. Let’s suppose a=2, n=4: (3^4 -2^4)/4=(81 -16)/4=65/4=16.25, not integer. a=2, n=3: 19/3≈6.333, nope. a=2, n=5: 211/5=42.2, nope.Wait, perhaps for a+1 divisible by n? Let’s suppose a+1=kn for some k. Then a=kn -1. Let's substitute into the expression:((kn)^n - (kn -1)^n)/n. Let's expand (kn -1)^n using the binomial theorem: (kn)^n - C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} + C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} - ... + (-1)^n. Therefore, (kn)^n - (kn -1)^n = C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} - C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} + ... + (-1)^{n+1}. Then divide by n: [C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} - C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} + ... + (-1)^{n+1}]/n = C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1}/n - C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2}/n + ... + (-1)^{n+1}/n.Simplify each term: C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1}/n = n*(kn)^{n-1}/n = (kn)^{n-1}. Similarly, the next term: -C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2}/n = - [n(n-1)/2]*(kn)^{n-2}/n = - (n-1)/2 * (kn)^{n-2}. The next term: +C(n,3)(kn)^{n-3}/n = [n(n-1)(n-2)/6]*(kn)^{n-3}/n = (n-1)(n-2)/6 * (kn)^{n-3}, and so on. The last term is (-1)^{n+1}/n. For this entire expression to be integer, all terms except possibly the last one must be integers, and the last term must also be integer. The last term is (-1)^{n+1}/n. For that to be integer, n must divide 1, so n=1. Which brings us back to n=1. So even if a+1 is a multiple of n, unless n=1, the last term (-1)^{n+1}/n is not integer. Therefore, this approach doesn't yield new solutions.Alternatively, maybe a is divisible by n. Let’s suppose a=kn. Then the expression becomes ((kn +1)^n - (kn)^n)/n. Expand (kn +1)^n using the binomial theorem: (kn)^n + C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} + C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} + ... +1. Subtract (kn)^n: C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} + C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} + ... +1. Divide by n: [C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1} + C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2} + ... +1]/n.First term: C(n,1)(kn)^{n-1}/n =n*(kn)^{n-1}/n = (kn)^{n-1}. Second term: C(n,2)(kn)^{n-2}/n = [n(n-1)/2]*(kn)^{n-2}/n = [(n-1)/2]*(kn)^{n-2}. Third term: C(n,3)(kn)^{n-3}/n = [n(n-1)(n-2)/6]*(kn)^{n-3}/n = [(n-1)(n-2)/6]*(kn)^{n-3}, etc. The last term is 1/n. Again, unless n=1, the last term 1/n is not integer, so the entire expression cannot be integer. Therefore, even if a is a multiple of n, unless n=1, the expression isn't integer. So again, only n=1 works.Therefore, combining all these observations, it seems that the only solutions are pairs where n=1 and a is any positive integer. But the problem is from a national training team test, which suggests there might be more solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that for composite n, the expression can't work. Let me test n=6 and a= some number.Take n=6, a=7: Compute ((8)^6 -7^6)/6. 8^6=262144, 7^6=117649. Difference=262144 -117649=144,495. Divide by 6: 144,495/6=24,082.5. Not integer. How about a=6? (7^6 -6^6)/6=(117649 -46656)/6=71, 71, let's compute 117649 -46656=71, 117649-46656=71, subtract 46656 from 117649: 117649 - 40000=77649, 77649 -6656=70993. Wait, no, 46656 is 6^6. 117649 -46656=710, let me compute 117649 - 46656:117649 - 40000=7764977649 - 6656=70993But 46656 is 40000 + 6656, so yes, 70993. So 70993/6=11832.166..., not integer. Hmm.Wait, maybe n= a= some value. For example, a=2, n=1: works. a=2, n=3: 19/3≈6.333, nope. a=3, n=2: (4^2 -3^2)/2=7/2=3.5, nope. a=4, n=5: (5^5 -4^5)/5=(3125 -1024)/5=2101/5=420.2, nope. Doesn't seem to work.Wait, what about n=0? Wait, no, n must be positive integer. So n=0 is excluded.Alternatively, maybe n divides the derivative of (x+1)^n -x^n evaluated at some point? Not sure. Alternatively, think of polynomial division. Let me consider the polynomial f(x)=(x+1)^n -x^n. Then f(a) must be divisible by n. We need f(a) ≡0 mod n for some a. For fixed n, find a such that f(a)≡0 mod n. But we need this for all coefficients? Not sure.Alternatively, consider modulo primes dividing n. Suppose n has a prime divisor p. Then, if the expression is divisible by n, it must be divisible by p. So, ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n must be divisible by p. So, ((a+1)^n -a^n) ≡0 mod p*n. But maybe this is complicating.Alternatively, suppose p is a prime divisor of n. Then, since ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is integer, ((a+1)^n -a^n) ≡0 mod p. So, (a+1)^n ≡a^n mod p. If p divides n, then since n >=p, we can write n=p*k. Then, (a+1)^{p*k} ≡a^{p*k} mod p. By Fermat's little theorem, (a+1)^{p*k} ≡(a+1)^k mod p, and similarly a^{p*k} ≡a^k mod p. Therefore, (a+1)^k ≡a^k mod p. So, for each prime p dividing n, we have (a+1)^k ≡a^k mod p, where k=n/p. Hmm, not sure how helpful this is.Alternatively, let's take p=2. Suppose n is even, so p=2 divides n. Then, k=n/2. So, (a+1)^{n/2} ≡a^{n/2} mod 2. Since modulo 2, (a+1) ≡a+1 mod 2, and a is either 0 or1 mod2. If a is even, then a=0 mod2, so a+1=1 mod2. Then, (1)^{n/2} ≡1 mod2, and 0^{n/2}=0 mod2. So 1 ≡0 mod2? Impossible. If a is odd, then a=1 mod2, a+1=0 mod2. Then (0)^{n/2} ≡0 mod2, and 1^{n/2}=1 mod2. So 0≡1 mod2? Also impossible. Therefore, for n even, there are no solutions. Therefore, n must be odd? Because if n is even, we can't have solutions. So n must be odd. So n is an odd integer >1. But we saw that for n=3,5,7 etc., the expression ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is not integer. Wait, but maybe for specific odd n and specific a?Wait, let's suppose n is an odd prime. Then, from before, (a+1)^n ≡a+1 modn and a^n≡a modn. Therefore, their difference is 1 modn, so 1≡0 modn, implying n=1. So again, no solutions for prime n>1. For composite odd n, say n=9. Let's check n=9, a= some number. Let's pick a=1: (2^9 -1)/9=(512 -1)/9=511/9≈56.777, not integer. a=2: (3^9 -2^9)/9=(19683 -512)/9=19171/9≈2130.111, nope. a=8: (9^9 -8^9)/9. That's a huge number, but let's see modulo9. 9^9 ≡0 mod9, 8^9≡(-1)^9≡-1 mod9. Therefore, 0 -(-1)=1 mod9. So 1 mod9, so 8^9 -9^9 ≡-1 mod9, but divided by9: (9^9 -8^9)/9≡(-1)/9 mod1, which is not integer. So no solution for a=8, n=9.Alternatively, maybe a= n-1. Let's take n=5, a=4: (5^5 -4^5)/5=(3125 -1024)/5=2101/5=420.2, nope. n=7, a=6: (7^7 -6^7)/7. 7^7=823543, 6^7=279936. Difference=823543 -279936=543,607. Divided by7:543,607/7=77,658.142..., nope. So no luck.Wait, perhaps n= a=1. Yes, that works. But that's trivial.Alternatively, think about the case when a=1. Then we need n dividing 2^n -1. As mentioned before, known as Wieferich primes, but primes only. And Wieferich primes are rare. For example, primes p where p² divides 2^{p}-1 -1. But even those are rare. So unless n=1, there are no other solutions for a=1.Similarly, for other a's, like a=2: n divides 3^n -2^n. When is this true? For n=1: yes. For n=5: 3^5=243, 2^5=32, difference=211. 211 is prime, so 5 does not divide 211. For n=7:3^7 -2^7=2187 -128=2059. 2059 divided by7=294.142..., not integer. So no.Alternatively, maybe the only solution is n=1. Is that possible? But the problem asks for all positive integer pairs (a,n). If n=1 works for any a, then the solutions are all (a,1) where a is positive integer. But maybe there's another solution when n divides (a+1)^n -a^n for n>1.Wait, let's try n= a=1: works. Wait, already considered. What about a= n=2? ((3)^2 -2^2)/2=5/2, nope. a=3, n=2: ((4)^2 -3^2)/2=7/2, nope. a=4, n=2: (5² -4²)/2=9/2=4.5, nope. Not working.Wait, let's check n=1: For any a, it works. So perhaps that's the only solution. The problem might be a trick question where the only solutions are (a,1) for any positive integer a. But why would it be on a national training team test then? Maybe I'm missing some cases where n>1.Wait, let's consider n= a^k for some k. For example, take n=3, a=2: ((3)^3 -2^3)/3=19/3≈6.333, nope. a=3, n=3: (4^3 -3^3)/3=37/3≈12.333, nope. Not helpful.Alternatively, consider if n is a divisor of (a+1 -a)=1, which again implies n=1. So seems like the only solution.Alternatively, think of it as follows: For the expression ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n to be integer, n must divide the numerator, which is (a+1)^n -a^n. From number theory, for n>1, this is generally not possible unless specific conditions are met. But our earlier attempts for various n>1 didn't yield any solutions, leading me to think that n=1 is the only case.However, let me check one more example with n=341 and a=1, even though earlier I thought it might not work. Wait, 2^341 -1 divided by341. If 341 divides 2^341 -1, then it would work. But 2^340 ≡1 mod341 (since 341 is a pseudoprime to base2). So 2^341=2^340*2≡1*2=2 mod341. Therefore, 2^341 -1≡1 mod341, which is 1, so 341 does not divide 2^341 -1. Therefore, even for composite n which are pseudoprimes, it doesn't work.Alternatively, perhaps n=1 is the only solution, and the problem is designed to trick you into overcomplicating it. Given that in all tested cases for n>1, the expression does not yield an integer, and the number-theoretic reasoning suggests that for n>1, it's impossible because (a+1)^n -a^n ≡1 modn, which implies n divides1, hence n=1. Therefore, the only solutions are (a,1) where a is a positive integer.But the problem says \\"positive integer pairs (a,n)\\", so n=1 is allowed. Therefore, all pairs where n=1 and a is any positive integer. So the solution is all pairs (a,1) with a≥1.But wait, let me check one more thing. Suppose n=0, but n must be positive. Okay. So yeah, n=1 is the only possibility. Therefore, the answer is all positive integers a with n=1. So the pairs are (a,1) for any positive integer a.But let me confirm once again. For n=1: ((a+1)^1 -a^1)/1=1, which is integer. For any n>1, as we saw, the expression ((a+1)^n -a^n)/n is not integer for any a. Therefore, the only solutions are (a,1). So the final answer is all pairs where n=1 and a is any positive integer.Final AnswerThe positive integer pairs are all pairs with ( n = 1 ). Thus, the solutions are (boxed{(a, 1)}) for any positive integer ( a ).</think>To find all positive integer pairs ((a, n)) such that (frac{(a+1)^n - a^n}{n}) is an integer, we start by analyzing small values of (n) and using number-theoretic reasoning.1. Case (n = 1):   [   frac{(a+1)^1 - a^1}{1} = (a + 1 - a) = 1   ]   This is an integer for any positive integer (a). Therefore, all pairs ((a, 1)) are solutions.2. Case (n = 2):   [   frac{(a+1)^2 - a^2}{2} = frac{2a + 1}{2}   ]   This is not an integer because (2a + 1) is odd. Hence, no solutions for (n = 2).3. Case (n = 3):   [   frac{(a+1)^3 - a^3}{3} = frac{3a^2 + 3a + 1}{3} = a^2 + a + frac{1}{3}   ]   The term (frac{1}{3}) makes this non-integer. Hence, no solutions for (n = 3).4. General Case (n > 1):   Using the binomial theorem, we expand ((a+1)^n - a^n) and divide by (n). For (n > 1), we find that the expression ((a+1)^n - a^n equiv 1 mod n) by Fermat's Little Theorem (for prime (n)) and properties of composite numbers. This implies (1 equiv 0 mod n), which is impossible unless (n = 1).5. Conclusion:   For (n > 1), the expression (frac{(a+1)^n - a^n}{n}) cannot be an integer. The only solutions occur when (n = 1), which works for any positive integer (a).Thus, the positive integer pairs ((a, n)) are all pairs where (n = 1). The solutions are (boxed{(a, 1)}) for any positive integer (a).]"},{"problem":"Given l and m represent lines, and alpha, beta, gamma represent planes, which of the following options is correct?

Examining the four options, option B is correct.  Therefore, the answer is boxed{text{B}}.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D correctly matches the given conditions to the conclusions. Let me take it step by step.First, let's list out all the conditions and conclusions:Conditions:1. ( l perp m ), ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp beta )2. ( alpha parallel beta ), ( beta parallel gamma )3. ( l perp alpha ), ( alpha parallel beta )4. ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp alpha )Conclusions:a: ( l perp beta )b: ( alpha perp beta )c: ( l parallel m )d: ( alpha parallel gamma )Now, the question is which combination of implications (each condition leading to a conclusion) is correct. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing the conditions with conclusions. Let me evaluate each implication one by one.Starting with Condition 1: ( l perp m ), ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp beta ). The possible conclusions are a, b, c, d. Let me see which conclusion follows from this.If ( l perp alpha ), then ( l ) is perpendicular to plane ( alpha ), meaning ( l ) is a line that's orthogonal to every line in ( alpha ). Similarly, ( m perp beta ) means ( m ) is perpendicular to plane ( beta ).Now, if ( l perp m ), and both ( l ) and ( m ) are perpendicular to their respective planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ), what does that say about the relationship between ( alpha ) and ( beta )?Wait, if ( l perp alpha ), then ( l ) is a normal vector to ( alpha ), and similarly, ( m ) is a normal vector to ( beta ). If ( l perp m ), then the normals of ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are perpendicular. Therefore, the planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) must themselves be perpendicular. So conclusion b: ( alpha perp beta ).Alternatively, could conclusion a: ( l perp beta ) be possible? If ( l perp alpha ), does that imply ( l perp beta ) if we know ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are related somehow? But from the given conditions, we only know that ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp beta ), and ( l perp m ). So unless there's a direct relation between ( alpha ) and ( beta ), we can't say ( l perp beta ). However, since ( l ) and ( m ) are perpendicular, and ( m ) is perpendicular to ( beta ), maybe ( l ) lies on ( beta ) or something? Hmm, no, not necessarily. Wait, if ( l perp m ) and ( m perp beta ), then ( l ) could be parallel to ( beta ) or something else. Let me think.If ( m perp beta ), then ( m ) is the normal of ( beta ). Since ( l perp m ), ( l ) must be orthogonal to the normal of ( beta ), which would mean ( l ) is parallel to the plane ( beta ). Therefore, ( l ) lies on a plane that's parallel to ( beta ), but not necessarily perpendicular to ( beta ). So conclusion a (( l perp beta )) is not necessarily true. Therefore, conclusion b seems correct here: ( alpha perp beta ). So Condition 1 implies conclusion b. So in the options, which one has 1⇒b? Let me check:Looking at the options:A: 1⇒aB: 1⇒bC: 1⇒cD: 1⇒dSo if Condition 1 implies conclusion b, then the correct option would have 1⇒b, which is option B, right? But let me verify.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. If ( l ) is perpendicular to ( alpha ), then the normal of ( alpha ) is along ( l ). Similarly, ( m ) is the normal of ( beta ). If ( l perp m ), then the normals are perpendicular, so the planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So conclusion b is implied by Condition 1. So 1⇒b, which is part of option B, C, or D? Option B: 1⇒b, 2⇒d, 3⇒a, 4⇒c. So yes, Condition 1 leading to b is part of option B.Wait, but let me not jump to conclusions yet. Let me check the rest as well.Moving on to Condition 2: ( alpha parallel beta ), ( beta parallel gamma ). So if two planes are parallel, and another plane is parallel to the second, then all three are parallel. So ( alpha parallel beta ) and ( beta parallel gamma ) implies ( alpha parallel gamma ). Therefore, conclusion d: ( alpha parallel gamma ). So Condition 2 implies conclusion d, which is conclusion d. So which options have 2⇒d? Let's see:A: 2⇒bB: 2⇒dC: 2⇒dD: 2⇒bSo both options B and C have 2⇒d. Hmm, so that's possible. So if 2⇒d is correct, then options B and C are still in play.Next, Condition 3: ( l perp alpha ), ( alpha parallel beta ). So if a line is perpendicular to a plane, and the plane is parallel to another plane, then the line should also be perpendicular to the other plane. So if ( l perp alpha ) and ( alpha parallel beta ), then ( l perp beta ). Therefore, conclusion a: ( l perp beta ). So Condition 3 implies a. Which options have 3⇒a?Looking:A: 3⇒cB: 3⇒aC: 3⇒aD: 3⇒aSo options B, C, D have 3⇒a. Hmm. So this is correct.Lastly, Condition 4: ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp alpha ). If two lines are both perpendicular to the same plane, then those lines must be parallel to each other. Because any two lines perpendicular to the same plane are parallel. Therefore, conclusion c: ( l parallel m ). So Condition 4 implies conclusion c. Which options have 4⇒c?Looking:A: 4⇒dB: 4⇒cC: 4⇒bD: 4⇒cSo options B and D have 4⇒c. So, Condition 4 implies conclusion c. So now, let's recap:Condition 1 ⇒ bCondition 2 ⇒ dCondition 3 ⇒ aCondition 4 ⇒ cNow, let's check which option corresponds to this:Option B: 1⇒b, 2⇒d, 3⇒a, 4⇒c → which matches exactly.Option C: 1⇒c, 2⇒d, 3⇒a, 4⇒b → Doesn't match.Option D: 1⇒d, 2⇒b, 3⇒a, 4⇒c → Doesn't match.Option A: All wrong.Therefore, the correct answer should be option B. Wait, but let me just double-check each of the conditions again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Double-checking Condition 1: ( l perp m ), ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp beta ). As previously reasoned, since ( l ) and ( m ) are normals to ( alpha ) and ( beta ), and they are perpendicular, planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) must be perpendicular. So conclusion b: ( alpha perp beta ). Correct.Condition 2: ( alpha parallel beta ), ( beta parallel gamma ). By transitivity of parallelism for planes, ( alpha parallel gamma ). So conclusion d. Correct.Condition 3: ( l perp alpha ), ( alpha parallel beta ). Since parallelism of planes preserves perpendicularity, ( l perp beta ). So conclusion a. Correct.Condition 4: Both lines perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel. Conclusion c. Correct.So all the implications in option B are correct. Therefore, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given the conditions and conclusions, we need to determine the correct implications:Conditions:1.

Hmm, the question is about determining which of the given options (A, B, C, D) correctly maps the conditions (①, ②, ③, ④) to the conclusions (a, b, c, d). Let me first parse through each condition and conclusion to understand what's being asked.First, the problem involves lines l, m and planes α, β, γ. The conditions are four different scenarios, and the conclusions are possible outcomes. We need to see which conditions lead to which conclusions correctly.Let me list out the conditions and conclusions again for clarity:Conditions:1. ① l is perpendicular to m, l is perpendicular to α, and m is perpendicular to β.2. ② α is parallel to β, and β is parallel to γ.3. ③ l is perpendicular to α, and α is parallel to β.4. ④ l is perpendicular to α, and m is perpendicular to α.Conclusions:a: l is perpendicular to β  b: α is perpendicular to β  c: l is parallel to m  d: α is parallel to γOur task is to figure out which condition implies which conclusion, then check which option (A, B, C, D) correctly pairs them.Let me go one by one through each condition and see which conclusion follows.Condition ①: l ⊥ m, l ⊥ α, m ⊥ βSo, l is perpendicular to both m and plane α, and m is perpendicular to plane β. Let's visualize this.If l is perpendicular to α, then l is a line orthogonal to plane α. Similarly, m is perpendicular to β. Now, l and m are perpendicular to each other. Hmm, what can we infer here?Wait, if two lines are perpendicular to each other, and each is perpendicular to a different plane, does that say anything about the relationship between the planes α and β?Alternatively, maybe we can think about the orientation of the planes. If l is perpendicular to α, then l is a normal vector to α. Similarly, m is a normal vector to β. If l and m are perpendicular, then the normals of α and β are perpendicular, which would mean that the planes α and β are perpendicular to each other. Because if the normals are perpendicular, the planes are perpendicular. So conclusion b: α ⊥ β would follow from condition ①.But let me verify that. If two planes have normals that are perpendicular, then yes, the planes are perpendicular. So if l is the normal to α and m is the normal to β, and l ⊥ m, then α ⊥ β. Therefore, condition ① implies conclusion b.But wait, the answer options have ① implying different conclusions. Let me check the options again.Looking at the options:A: ①⇒a, ②⇒b, ③⇒c, ④⇒d  B: ①⇒b, ②⇒d, ③⇒a, ④⇒c  C: ①⇒c, ②⇒d, ③⇒a, ④⇒b  D: ①⇒d, ②⇒b, ③⇒a, ④⇒c  So, according to my deduction, ①⇒b. So in option B, ①⇒b. But in option B, ① is mapped to conclusion b. Wait, but in option B, ①⇒b. Wait, but I thought that ①⇒b, but let's check again.Wait, conclusion b is α is perpendicular to β. Yes, that's what I concluded. So if ① leads to conclusion b, then in the answer options, the one that has ①⇒b is option B. So that's possible.But let me check other options as well. Let me not jump to conclusions.Condition ②: α ∥ β, β ∥ γIf α is parallel to β and β is parallel to γ, then by transitivity, α is parallel to γ. So conclusion d: α ∥ γ would follow. So ②⇒d. Let's check the answer options.Looking at the options:In option B, ②⇒d. So if ②⇒d, then that's correct. Conclusion d is α ∥ γ, which is indeed the case. So condition ② implies conclusion d. Therefore, in the answer options, ②⇒d is part of option B and C. Wait, in option B, ②⇒d, and in option C, ②⇒d as well. So that's not conflicting yet.Condition ③: l ⊥ α, α ∥ βIf l is perpendicular to α, and α is parallel to β, then l must also be perpendicular to β. Because if two planes are parallel, their normals are parallel. So if l is perpendicular to α, it's also perpendicular to β. Therefore, conclusion a: l ⊥ β follows. So ③⇒a. Let's check the options.In option B, ③⇒a. So that's correct. So far, options B and C both have ③⇒a. Wait, option C says ③⇒a, which is correct. So this is consistent.Condition ④: l ⊥ α, m ⊥ αIf both l and m are perpendicular to α, then l and m are both normal vectors to α. In 3D space, two lines perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel to each other. Because all normals to a plane are parallel. Therefore, l ∥ m. So conclusion c: l ∥ m. Therefore, ④⇒c.Looking at the answer options:In option B, ④⇒c. In option D, ④⇒c as well. So this is correct for options B and D. But since we already saw that ①⇒b, which is part of option B, and ④⇒c is part of option B as well, let's see.So compiling the correct implications:- ①⇒b  - ②⇒d  - ③⇒a  - ④⇒cWhich corresponds to option B: ①⇒b, ②⇒d, ③⇒a, ④⇒c.Let me verify once more each step to be sure.Rechecking ①:l ⊥ m, l ⊥ α, m ⊥ β.If l is perpendicular to α, then l is a normal vector of α. Similarly, m is a normal vector of β. If l and m are perpendicular, then the normals of α and β are perpendicular, so the planes α and β must be perpendicular. Therefore, ①⇒b. Correct.Rechecking ②:α ∥ β, β ∥ γ. Transitivity of parallelism gives α ∥ γ, so ②⇒d. Correct.Rechecking ③:l ⊥ α and α ∥ β. Since α and β are parallel, any line perpendicular to α is also perpendicular to β. Hence, l ⊥ β. So ③⇒a. Correct.Rechecking ④:l ⊥ α and m ⊥ α. Two lines perpendicular to the same plane must be parallel. Hence, l ∥ m. So ④⇒c. Correct.Therefore, option B is the correct one. Let me check the other options to ensure none of them could also be correct.Option A: ①⇒a. But we concluded ①⇒b, so A is incorrect.Option C: ①⇒c. No, ①⇒b, so C is out.Option D: ①⇒d. No, ①⇒b, so D is out.Thus, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given the problem, we need to determine which conditions (①, ②, ③, ④) lead to which conclusions (a, b, c, d). Here is the step-by-step analysis:1. Condition ①: ( l perp m ), ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp beta )     - ( l ) and ( m ) are normals to planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ) respectively. Since ( l perp m ), the normals are perpendicular, implying ( alpha perp beta ). Thus, ① leads to conclusion b.2.

Condition ③: ( l perp alpha ), ( alpha parallel beta )     - If ( l ) is perpendicular to ( alpha ) and ( alpha parallel beta ), then ( l ) must also be perpendicular to ( beta ). Thus, ③ leads to conclusion a.4. Condition ④: ( l perp alpha ), ( m perp alpha )     - Both ( l ) and ( m ) are normals to ( alpha ), so they must be parallel. Thus, ④ leads to conclusion c.The correct mappings are: ①⇒b, ②⇒d, ③⇒a, ④⇒c, which corresponds to option B.[boxed{B}]]"},{"problem":"For any natural number, let S(n) denote sum of digits of n. Find the number of 3 digit numbers for which S(S(n)) = 2.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of three-digit numbers ( n ) such that ( S(S(n)) = 2 ), where ( S(n) ) denotes the sum of the digits of ( n ).2. Sum of Digits Constraints:   For a three-digit number ( n ), the sum of its digits ( S(n) ) can be at most ( 27 ) (since the maximum sum is ( 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 )).3. Sum of Sum of Digits:   The sum of the digits of any number not greater than ( 27 ) is at most ( 9 ) (since the maximum sum is ( 2 + 7 = 9 )).4. Divisibility Rule:   By the divisibility rule of ( 9 ), ( S(n) equiv n pmod{9} ). Therefore, ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) must hold for three-digit numbers congruent to ( 2 pmod{9} ).5. Finding Numbers Congruent to ( 2 pmod{9} ):   The three-digit numbers congruent to ( 2 pmod{9} ) are:   [   101, 110, 119, ldots, 992   ]   This sequence is an arithmetic progression with the first term ( 101 ) and common difference ( 9 ).6. Counting the Numbers:   To find the number of terms in this sequence, we use the formula for the ( n )-th term of an arithmetic sequence:   [   a_n = a + (n-1)d   ]   Setting ( a_n = 992 ), ( a = 101 ), and ( d = 9 ):   [   992 = 101 + (n-1) cdot 9   ]   Solving for ( n ):   [   992 - 101 = (n-1) cdot 9    891 = (n-1) cdot 9    n-1 = 99    n = 100   ]   Therefore, there are ( 100 ) such numbers.7. Verification by Brute-Force Approach:   - If ( S(n) = 2 ), then ( n ) can be ( 101, 110, 200 ), giving ( 3 ) possibilities.   - If ( S(n) = 11 ), we need to count the number of solutions to ( a + b + c = 11 ) where ( a, b, c ) are digits and ( a neq 0 ). Using the stars and bars method:     [     binom{13}{2} = 78     ]     Subtracting invalid cases where any digit exceeds ( 9 ) or ( a = 0 ):     [     78 - 9 - 8 = 61     ]   - If ( S(n) = 20 ), we need to count the number of solutions to ( a + b + c = 7 ) where ( a, b, c ) are digits. Using the stars and bars method:     [     binom{9}{2} = 36     ]8. Adding All Possibilities:   Summing up all the cases:   [   3 + 61 + 36 = 100   ]Thus, the number of three-digit numbers for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) is ( boxed{100} ).","generations":"[<think>Alright, so I need to figure out how many three-digit numbers n satisfy the condition that S(S(n)) equals 2. Here, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. Let me start by breaking down what this means.First, let me recall that S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. For example, if n is 123, then S(n) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Then S(S(n)) would be S(6) = 6, since 6 is a single-digit number. But in the problem, we need S(S(n)) to equal 2. That means that after summing the digits of n once, we get some number, and then summing the digits of that number gives us 2. So essentially, the sum of the digits of n must be a number whose digits add up to 2. Hmm, let me think. So S(n) must be a number where when you sum its digits, you get 2. What numbers satisfy that? Well, single-digit numbers that are 2, obviously. But S(n) could also be a two-digit number where the sum of the digits is 2. For example, 11 (1 + 1 = 2), 20 (2 + 0 = 2), 101 (but wait, 101 is a three-digit number, but S(n) would be 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, but S(n) is already 2 here). Wait, actually, S(n) can be any number where the sum of its digits is 2. However, S(n) itself is the sum of the digits of a three-digit number, which is between 1 (for 100) and 27 (for 999). So S(n) can range from 1 to 27. Therefore, S(n) must be a number in that range whose digits sum to 2.So first, I need to find all possible values of S(n) such that S(S(n)) = 2. Then, for each such possible value, count the number of three-digit numbers n where S(n) equals that value. Then sum all those counts.So step 1: Find all numbers m where S(m) = 2 and m is between 1 and 27.Let me list all numbers between 1 and 27 whose digits add up to 2. Let's start with single-digit numbers. The only single-digit number with digit sum 2 is 2 itself. Then two-digit numbers: the possible two-digit numbers where digits add to 2 are 11 (1+1=2), 20 (2+0=2). What about numbers like 101? Wait, 101 is a three-digit number, but m is between 1 and 27, so 101 is outside that range. So the possible m are 2, 11, 20. Let's check 20: 2 + 0 = 2, yes. 11: 1 + 1 = 2. Are there any others? Let's see: 101 is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, but 101 is 101, which is more than 27. So numbers from 1 to 27 with digit sum 2 are 2, 11, 20. Let's confirm:- 2: digits sum to 2. Yes.- 11: 1 + 1 = 2. Yes.- 20: 2 + 0 = 2. Yes.- 101: Not in the range.- 110: Also not in the range.- 200: Not in the range.- 1001: No, way too big.So the possible m values are 2, 11, 20.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of three-digit numbers n such that S(n) is either 2, 11, or 20. Then the total number is the sum of the counts for each of these cases.So now, I need to compute:1. The number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 2.2. The number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 11.3. The number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 20.Then add them all together.Let me handle each case one by one.Case 1: S(n) = 2We need three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) where the digits a (hundreds place), b (tens place), c (units place) satisfy a + b + c = 2, where a ≥ 1 (since it's a three-digit number). So the possible triples (a, b, c) with a ≥ 1 and a + b + c = 2.Since a ≥ 1, the possible values for a are 1 or 2 (since a can't be more than 2, because 3 would already make a + b + c ≥ 3).If a = 1, then b + c = 1. The non-negative integer solutions for b and c are (0,1), (1,0). So two solutions.If a = 2, then b + c = 0. Only (0,0) is possible. So one solution.Therefore, total numbers for S(n) = 2: 2 + 1 = 3.Let me list them to confirm:- 101: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2- 110: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2- 200: 2 + 0 + 0 = 2Yes, three numbers. That checks out.Case 2: S(n) = 11Now, we need three-digit numbers where a + b + c = 11, with a ≥ 1, and a, b, c are digits (0 ≤ b, c ≤ 9; 1 ≤ a ≤ 9).This is a classic stars and bars problem, but with constraints. Let's model it.We need the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 11 where a ≥ 1, and a ≤ 9, b ≤ 9, c ≤ 9.First, let's adjust for a ≥ 1 by substituting a' = a - 1, so a' ≥ 0. Then the equation becomes a' + 1 + b + c = 11 ⇒ a' + b + c = 10. Now, we need non-negative integers a', b, c such that a' + b + c = 10, with a' ≤ 8 (since original a = a' + 1 ≤ 9 ⇒ a' ≤ 8), b ≤ 9, c ≤ 9.So we need to compute the number of solutions to x + y + z = 10 with x ≤ 8, y ≤ 9, z ≤ 9.Using stars and bars without constraints: C(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 66.Now subtract the solutions where x ≥ 9 or y ≥ 10 or z ≥ 10.But since the total sum is 10, we need to check if these constraints are violated.First, x ≥ 9: Let x' = x - 9. Then x' + y + z = 10 - 9 = 1. Number of solutions: C(1 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(3, 2) = 3.Similarly, y ≥ 10: Let y' = y - 10. Then x + y' + z = 10 -10 = 0. Only 1 solution: x=0, y'=0, z=0. But original y would be 10, which is invalid since y is a digit (max 9). So number of solutions here: 1.Similarly for z ≥ 10: same as y, 1 solution.Now check if there are any overlaps where two constraints are violated. For example, x ≥9 and y ≥10. Then x' + y' + z = 10 -9 -10 = -9, which is impossible. Similarly, any two constraints would require subtracting more than 10, which is impossible. Similarly, all three constraints would require subtracting 9 +10 +10=29, which is way more than 10. So no overlaps.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion, the total number of invalid solutions is 3 (from x ≥9) + 1 (from y ≥10) +1 (from z ≥10) = 5.Therefore, the total number of valid solutions is 66 - 5 = 61.Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 11 is 61.Wait, let me verify this with another approach to make sure.Alternatively, since the original equation is a + b + c =11 with a ≥1 and a, b, c ≤9.So a can be from 1 to 9, but since a + b + c =11, and b and c are at most 9, let's see:Let me iterate over possible values of a from 1 to 9:For each a, b + c = 11 - a.But b and c are digits, so 0 ≤ b, c ≤9. So 11 - a must be between 0 and 18. Since a is at least 1, 11 - a can be as low as 2 (if a=9) and as high as 10 (if a=1). Wait:Wait, if a=1, then b + c=10. So the number of solutions for b and c is 11 (from (0,10) to (10,0)), but since b and c can only be up to 9, the valid solutions are (1,9), (2,8), ..., (9,1). So 9 solutions? Wait, 0 +10 is invalid, 1+9, ..., 9+1, 10+0 invalid. So 9 solutions.Wait, but in general, for b + c = k, the number of non-negative integer solutions where b, c ≤9 is:If k ≤9: number of solutions is k +1.If 10 ≤k ≤18: number of solutions is 19 -k.Therefore, for a=1, b + c=10: number of solutions is 19 -10=9.Similarly, for a=2, b +c=9: number of solutions is 9 +1=10.For a=3, b +c=8: 9 solutions.Wait, no:Wait, if k=8, then the number of solutions is 9 (from 0+8 to 8+0). But since k=8 ≤9, number of solutions is 8 +1=9. So for a=3, b +c=8: 9 solutions.Wait, hold on, perhaps the formula is:For b + c = k, number of solutions with 0 ≤b, c ≤9:If k ≤9: k +1 solutions.If 10 ≤k ≤18: 19 -k solutions.Yes, that's a standard result.Therefore, for each a from 1 to 9:Sum over a=1 to 9 of number of solutions for b + c =11 -a.But 11 -a varies as follows:When a=1: k=10 ⇒ 19 -10=9 solutions.a=2: k=9 ⇒9 +1=10 solutions.a=3: k=8 ⇒8 +1=9 solutions.a=4: k=7 ⇒7 +1=8 solutions.a=5: k=6 ⇒6 +1=7 solutions.a=6: k=5 ⇒5 +1=6 solutions.a=7: k=4 ⇒4 +1=5 solutions.a=8: k=3 ⇒3 +1=4 solutions.a=9: k=2 ⇒2 +1=3 solutions.Wait, hold on, let me check again:Wait, when a=1, k=11 -1=10: 19 -10=9.a=2: k=9: 9 +1=10.a=3: k=8: 8 +1=9.Wait, this seems inconsistent with the previous approach. Wait, the formula is:For k=10: 19 -10=9.For k=9: 9 +1=10.But in reality, when k=10, the number of solutions is 9 (from (1,9) to (9,1)).Similarly, when k=9, the number of solutions is 10 (from (0,9) to (9,0)).But here, in the problem, a ≥1, so for a=1, k=10: b and c can be 0-9, but their sum is 10. So (0,10) is invalid, (1,9) to (9,1): 9 solutions.Similarly, for a=2, k=9: (0,9) to (9,0): 10 solutions.But in the formula, when k=10: 19 -10=9, which matches. For k=9: 9 +1=10, which also matches. So the formula works.Therefore, proceeding:Sum over a=1 to 9:a=1: 9a=2:10a=3:9a=4:8a=5:7a=6:6a=7:5a=8:4a=9:3Total solutions: 9 +10 +9 +8 +7 +6 +5 +4 +3.Let me compute that:9 +10 =1919 +9=2828 +8=3636 +7=4343 +6=4949 +5=5454 +4=5858 +3=61.Yes, total 61 solutions. So that's the same as the stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion. So 61 numbers. So that seems correct.Case 3: S(n) =20Now, three-digit numbers where a + b + c =20, with a ≥1, a, b, c ≤9.Again, let's approach this with stars and bars or another method.First, since a is at least 1, set a' =a -1, so a' ≥0, then a' +1 + b + c =20 ⇒ a' + b + c =19.We need non-negative integers a', b, c where a' ≤8 (since a ≤9 ⇒a' ≤8), b ≤9, c ≤9. So the equation is a' + b + c =19 with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.This is similar to the previous case, but let's use stars and bars again.Total solutions without constraints: C(19 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(21, 2) = 210.Now subtract the solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.First, compute the number of solutions where a' ≥9: Let a'' = a' -9. Then a'' + b + c =19 -9=10. The number of solutions is C(10 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Solutions where b ≥10: Let b' = b -10. Then a' + b' + c =19 -10=9. Number of solutions: C(9 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(11,2)=55.Similarly, solutions where c ≥10: same as b, 55 solutions.Now check for overlaps:Solutions where a' ≥9 and b ≥10: a'' + b' + c =10 -10= -1, impossible.Similarly, a' ≥9 and c ≥10: a'' + b + c' =10 -10= -1, impossible.Similarly, b ≥10 and c ≥10: a' + b' + c' =19 -10 -10= -1, impossible.All three constraints: even more impossible.So there are no overlapping solutions. Therefore, total invalid solutions are 66 +55 +55=176.But wait, original total solutions without constraints was 210. So subtract 176? That would give 210 -176=34. But that can't be right, because 34 seems low.Wait, perhaps there's an error here. Let me think again.Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula says:Total valid = Total - (A + B + C) + (AB + AC + BC) - ABC)But in this case, AB, AC, BC are all 0, as there are no overlapping solutions, as we saw. Therefore, Total valid = Total - (A + B + C).Therefore, 210 -66 -55 -55=210 -176=34. So 34 solutions.But let's verify this with another method.Alternatively, since a' + b + c=19, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.But since a' can be up to 8, and b and c up to 9. Let's think about how to compute the number of solutions.Alternatively, since the maximum possible sum with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9 is 8 +9 +9=26, but we need the sum to be 19. So maybe we can use generating functions or manual counting.Alternatively, iterate over possible a' from 0 to 8 (since a' ≤8). For each a', compute the number of solutions (b, c) with b + c =19 -a', and b ≤9, c ≤9.So for each a', the required k =19 -a'. So k ranges from 19 -0=19 down to 19 -8=11.For each k in 11 to19, find the number of (b, c) with b + c=k, b ≤9, c ≤9.But since k is between 11 and19, the number of solutions for each k is 19 -k (using the same formula as before: for k ≥10, number of solutions is 19 -k).Wait, for example, if k=19, then b +c=19. Since b and c are at most 9, the only possible solution is (9,10) and (10,9), but both invalid since c or b exceeds 9. Therefore, 0 solutions.Wait, wait, hold on. If k=19, the maximum b or c can be 9, so 9 +9=18. So k=19 is impossible. So 0 solutions. Similarly, k=18: possible solutions (9,9). 1 solution. But according to the formula 19 -18=1, which matches.Similarly, k=17: (9,8), (8,9): 2 solutions. 19 -17=2, which matches.So the formula 19 -k works for k from 10 to 18. But wait, for k=19, 19 -19=0, which also matches. So actually, the formula 19 -k works for k ≥10.Therefore, for each a' from 0 to8, k=19 -a', which ranges from19 down to11. Therefore, number of solutions is 19 -k=19 - (19 -a')=a'.Wait, wait, that seems interesting.Wait, for each a':Number of solutions = 19 -k =19 - (19 -a')=a'.Therefore, for a'=0: k=19, solutions=0a'=1: k=18, solutions=1a'=2: k=17, solutions=2...a'=8: k=11, solutions=8Therefore, the number of solutions for each a' is equal to a', except for a'=0 which gives 0.Therefore, total solutions is sum from a'=0 to8 of (a' if a' ≥1 else 0).Which is 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8=36.But wait, this contradicts the previous result of34. Hmm.Wait, where is the mistake here?Let me check with a concrete example.Take a'=1:k=19 -1=18. So b +c=18. The solutions are (9,9). So 1 solution. Correct. So 19 -18=1.a'=2:k=17. Solutions are (9,8), (8,9). 2 solutions. Correct. 19 -17=2.a'=3:k=16. Solutions: (9,7), (8,8), (7,9). 3 solutions. But according to the formula, 19 -16=3. Correct.Wait, but if a'=8:k=11. Then b +c=11. Solutions: (2,9), (3,8), ..., (9,2). How many? From 2 to9: 8 solutions. Wait, 11 -9=2, so starting from (2,9) to (9,2). 8 solutions. Wait, but 19 -11=8. So formula gives 8, which matches.But then, sum over a'=0 to8:For a'=0: 0a'=1:1a'=2:2...a'=8:8Total sum: 0 +1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36.But according to the stars and bars approach, we had 34 solutions. So discrepancy here.Wait, so which is correct?Let me check with manual counting for a few a'.Take a'=1:b +c=18. Only (9,9). So 1 solution. Correct.a'=2:b +c=17. (9,8), (8,9). 2 solutions. Correct.a'=3:b +c=16. (9,7), (8,8), (7,9). 3 solutions. Correct.a'=4:b +c=15. (9,6), (8,7), (7,8), (6,9). 4 solutions. Correct.a'=5:b +c=14. (9,5), (8,6), (7,7), (6,8), (5,9). 5 solutions. Correct.a'=6:b +c=13. (9,4), (8,5), (7,6), (6,7), (5,8), (4,9). 6 solutions. Correct.a'=7:b +c=12. (9,3), (8,4), (7,5), (6,6), (5,7), (4,8), (3,9). 7 solutions. Correct.a'=8:b +c=11. (9,2), (8,3), (7,4), (6,5), (5,6), (4,7), (3,8), (2,9). 8 solutions. Correct.So summing these:1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36. But according to the stars and bars approach, the total was 34.So why the discrepancy? There must be an error in the stars and bars approach.Wait, let's re-examine the stars and bars calculation.Original equation: a' + b + c =19, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.Total solutions without constraints: C(19 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(21,2)=210.Now subtract solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.Solutions where a' ≥9: set a''=a'-9, so a'' + b + c=10. Number of solutions=C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Solutions where b ≥10: set b'=b -10, so a' + b' + c=9. Number of solutions=C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(11,2)=55.Similarly, solutions where c ≥10: 55.Total subtracted:66+55+55=176.Total valid=210 -176=34.But manual count gives 36. So where is the mistake here?Ah! Wait, in the stars and bars approach, when we subtract the solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, etc., these are solutions in non-negative integers, but they don't take into account that after substitution, variables still need to be non-negative. Wait, but the substitutions already ensure that. Hmm.Wait, perhaps there is an error in the constraints. Let's check the maximum possible sum when constraints are violated.Wait, for example, when we subtract solutions where a' ≥9, which gives a'' + b + c=10. However, in these solutions, a'' can be up to 10 (since a' can be up to 19, but a'=a''+9, so a''=a'-9). But since a' was originally part of a' + b + c=19, a'' can be up to 19 -9=10. However, the substitution allows a'' to be any non-negative integer, but in reality, a' is constrained by a' ≤8. Wait, no: the substitution is for counting the number of solutions where a' ≥9, so a''=a'-9, which is ≥0, and a'' can go up to 19 -9 -0 -0=10. So the number of solutions where a' ≥9 is indeed C(12,2)=66.Similarly, for b ≥10, substituting b'=b -10, then a' + b' + c=9. Here, a' can be up to 9 (since b' ≥0 and c ≥0), but a' is actually allowed up to 8 (since a' ≤8). Wait, no. Wait, in this substitution, a' is still a non-negative integer, not restricted. Wait, but in reality, a' is restricted to a' ≤8. But in the substitution, we are counting all solutions where b ≥10, regardless of a' and c. But a' in this case can be up to 9, but since in the original problem, a' is allowed up to8, these solutions where a' ≥9 would have already been counted in the a' ≥9 case. Wait, but we are using inclusion-exclusion here, where we subtract A, B, C separately, assuming no overlap.But wait, in reality, when you subtract A (a' ≥9), B (b ≥10), and C (c ≥10), these are separate cases. However, if in the problem where a' can be up to8, but when you subtract B (b ≥10), you allow a' to be any non-negative integer, including those greater than8. Wait, but in reality, in the original equation, a' is limited to8. So when you subtract the number of solutions where b ≥10, you have to consider that a' can only go up to8. Wait, no, the substitution was done on the equation where a' is a non-negative integer (without the a' ≤8 constraint), but the original problem has a' ≤8. So perhaps the stars and bars approach is flawed here because the substitution isn't accounting for the a' ≤8 constraint when subtracting B and C.Ah, here's the problem. The stars and bars approach first computes all solutions without constraints, then subtracts the ones that violate each constraint. However, when we subtract the solutions where b ≥10 or c ≥10, we need to ensure that in those subtracted solutions, a' is still allowed to be up to8. But in the stars and bars calculation, when we compute the number of solutions where b ≥10, we are considering a' as an unrestricted variable (from 0 to infinity), but in reality, a' is restricted to ≤8. Therefore, the stars and bars method over-subtracts here because it includes cases where a' might exceed8. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion isn't directly applicable here because the constraints on a', b, c are not independent.Therefore, the manual counting approach where we iterate over a' from0 to8 and compute the number of valid (b, c) pairs is more accurate. Which gives 36 solutions.Therefore, the correct count is36.But why the discrepancy?Wait, in the stars and bars approach, we considered all solutions to a' + b + c=19, subtracted those where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10. But in reality, when a' ≥9, even though the original problem restricts a' ≤8, in the stars and bars approach, we have to first consider all possible a', then subtract those that violate the constraints. But the problem is that when we subtract b ≥10 or c ≥10, we have to do it under the original constraints (including a' ≤8). But since the stars and bars approach does not account for the a' ≤8 constraint when subtracting the other constraints, it's not accurate.Therefore, the correct answer is36, as per the manual count.Wait, but let's verify with an example.Take a'=8:Then, b +c=11. As we saw earlier, there are8 solutions. Similarly, for a'=7, b +c=12, which has7 solutions. So total from a'=0 to8 is0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36.Alternatively, if we think about generating functions, the generating function for a' is x^0 +x^1 +... +x^8, and for b and c is (x^0 +x^1 +... +x^9)^2. The coefficient of x^19 in the product (a' generating function)*(b generating function)*(c generating function). Which would be the same as summing over a'=0 to8, the coefficient of x^{19 -a'} in (x^0 +... +x^9)^2. Which is exactly what we did manually. And since for each a', the coefficient is19 -k=19 - (19 -a')=a', so sum a'=0 to8 of (a' if k ≥10 else ...). Wait, but for k=19 -a' ≥10? Since a' ≤8, 19 -a' ≥11. Therefore, k ranges from11 to19. So for each a', the coefficient is19 -k=19 - (19 -a')=a'. Hence, sum of a'=0 to8 of a'=36.Therefore, stars and bars gave34, manual count gives36. The correct answer is36. Therefore, the mistake was in the stars and bars approach because it didn't account for the overlapping constraints properly. Therefore, trusting the manual count, the correct number is36.Therefore, Case3: S(n)=20 gives36 three-digit numbers.Total Number of SolutionsNow, adding up the three cases:Case1:3Case2:61Case3:36Total:3 +61 +36=100.Wait, 3+61=64, 64+36=100. So the total number is100.But wait, let me check once again.Wait, 3 numbers for sum2, 61 for sum11, and36 for sum20. So total100.But that seems a round number. Hmm.But let me confirm with an example for sum20.Take the number 992:9 +9 +2=20. Then S(n)=20, S(S(n))=2 +0=2. So that's valid.Another example: 983:9 +8 +3=20. S(S(n))=2.Similarly, 888:8 +8 +8=24. Wait, that's sum24. S(S(n))=2 +4=6≠2. So not valid. So not in our count.But 992 is valid, and according to our count, there are36 such numbers.Another example: 299:2 +9 +9=20. Valid.So, 36 numbers where digits sum to20.Similarly, numbers like 101 sum to2, which we had3 of.And numbers like 902:9 +0 +2=11, which would be in the61 count.Therefore, total numbers:3+61+36=100.But 100 is the total number of three-digit numbers that satisfy S(S(n))=2.Wait, but three-digit numbers are from100 to999, inclusive. That's900 numbers. 100 is about11% of them. Seems plausible?Alternatively, I can check a smaller case.Wait, for two-digit numbers, how many have S(S(n))=2.Compute that as a test.For two-digit numbers from10 to99.S(S(n))=2. So S(n) must be2,11,20. But S(n) for two-digit numbers is between1 (for10) and18 (for99). So possible m=2,11,20. But 20 is18 max. So m=2 and11.So for two-digit numbers:Case1:S(n)=2: numbers where a + b=2, a≥1. So a=1, b=1 (11); a=2, b=0 (20). So two numbers:11,20.Case2:S(n)=11: a +b=11, a≥1. So a from2 to9 (if a=1, b=10 invalid). Wait, a from2 to9:a=2, b=9 (29)a=3, b=8 (38)...a=9, b=2 (92)Total8 numbers.So total numbers:2 +8=10. So S(S(n))=2 for two-digit numbers is10 numbers.But if we use our formula:Sum over m=2,11 (since 20 is too big).For m=2: two numbers.For m=11: number of two-digit numbers with digit sum11:8 numbers.Total10, which is correct.Therefore, in the two-digit case, the formula works.Similarly, in three-digit numbers, our calculation gives100. Let's check with another approach.Alternatively, note that S(S(n))=2 implies that S(n) ≡2 mod9, since the sum of digits function modulo9 is equal to the number itself modulo9. Therefore, S(n) ≡2 mod9. So S(n)=2,11,20. Which are the numbers ≡2 mod9 between1 and27. Indeed, 2,11,20.Therefore, another way to compute this is to compute the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum ≡2 mod9. Then, the total number would be the number of three-digit numbers where S(n) ≡2 mod9. However, we need to be careful here because even though S(n) ≡2 mod9, we have the additional constraint that S(n) must be exactly2,11, or20. Because S(S(n))=2. If S(n) was another number ≡2 mod9, like29, but S(n) can only go up to27, so next would be29, but that's over27. So only2,11,20.Therefore, the total number is indeed the count of numbers with digit sums2,11,20.Therefore, according to our previous calculation,100.Alternatively, since there are900 three-digit numbers, and if the digit sums are equally likely mod9, we would expect about100 numbers for each residue. But actually, the distribution is not exactly uniform, but for large numbers, it approximates uniformity. However, in this case, we have exactly100. So maybe the count is correct.But let's see.Alternatively, use generating functions.The generating function for three-digit numbers (a, b, c), a≥1, a,b,c ≤9 is:(x +x^2 +... +x^9)(1 +x +... +x^9)^2.We need the coefficients of x^2, x^11, andx^20 in this generating function.Sum those coefficients.Compute the coefficient ofx^2:In (x +x^2 +... +x^9)(1 +x +... +x^9)^2.The coefficient ofx^2 is the same as the coefficient ofx^1 in (1 +x +... +x^8)(1 +x +... +x^9)^2.But a≥1, so original isx*(1 +x +... +x^8)*(1 +x +... +x^9)^2. Wait, maybe not.Wait, the generating function is:(x +x^2 +... +x^9)(1 +x +... +x^9)^2.To find the coefficient ofx^2:Only possible if a=1 or2.Fora=1: x*(1 +x +... contributions from b andc sum to1.Which isx*(terms where b +c=1).The number of solutions is2: (0,1) and(1,0).Fora=2: x^2*(terms where b +c=0).Which isx^2*1.So total coefficient ofx^2:2 +1=3, which matches our previous result.Similarly, coefficient ofx^11:We need the coefficient ofx^11 in (x +x^2 +... +x^9)(1 +x +... +x^9)^2.This is equivalent to the sum overa=1 to9 of [coefficient ofx,<think>Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is asking for the number of three-digit numbers n such that S(S(n)) equals 2. Here, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. Hmm, so first, let's make sure I understand what S(S(n)) means. It means we first calculate the sum of the digits of n, which is S(n), and then take the sum of the digits of that result, which gives us S(S(n)). And we want this final result to be 2. So, the problem reduces to finding three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits of the sum of their digits is 2. Let's break that down. First, let's consider that n is a three-digit number. That means n ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive. Each n can be represented as abc, where a, b, and c are digits from 0 to 9, with a being at least 1 (since it's a three-digit number). So, S(n) would be a + b + c. Then S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of the number a + b + c. For example, if n is 123, S(n) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and then S(S(n)) is S(6) = 6. But we want cases where S(S(n)) equals 2. So, let's think about what S(S(n)) = 2 implies. If the sum of the digits of S(n) is 2, that means S(n) itself must be a number whose digits add up to 2. So, S(n) could be 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, 200, etc. But wait, S(n) is the sum of the digits of a three-digit number. The maximum possible sum of digits for a three-digit number is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. So S(n) can only be between 1 (for 100) and 27 (for 999). Therefore, S(n) must be a number between 1 and 27 whose digits add up to 2. So, what numbers between 1 and 27 have a digit sum of 2? Let's list them:- 2 (digits sum to 2)- 11 (1 + 1 = 2)- 20 (2 + 0 = 2)Are there any others? Let's check. 101 is too big (already over 27), same with 110, 200. So in the range 1-27, the numbers with digit sum 2 are 2, 11, and 20. Therefore, S(n) must be either 2, 11, or 20. Therefore, our problem reduces to finding the number of three-digit numbers n where the sum of their digits is either 2, 11, or 20. Then, the total number of such three-digit numbers will be the sum of the numbers of three-digit numbers with digit sums 2, 11, and 20. So, we need to compute three separate quantities:1. The number of three-digit numbers where a + b + c = 2.2. The number of three-digit numbers where a + b + c = 11.3. The number of three-digit numbers where a + b + c = 20.Then add them all together.Let's handle each case one by one.Case 1: a + b + c = 2We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 2, where a is at least 1 (since it's a three-digit number), and b and c are at least 0. To adjust for the constraint that a is at least 1, we can substitute a' = a - 1, so a' + b + c = 1, where a', b, c are non-negative integers. The number of solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3. Wait, that seems too low. Let's check again.Wait, the equation is a + b + c = 2, with a >= 1, b >= 0, c >= 0. Let me think of stars and bars. If a >=1, then we can set a' = a -1, so a' + b + c = 1. Then, the number of non-negative integer solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 -1 ) = C(3, 2) = 3. But let's list them:Possible values for a, b, c:Since a >=1, the possible a can be 1 or 2.If a =1, then b + c =1. The solutions are (1,0,1), (1,1,0).If a =2, then b + c =0. The only solution is (2,0,0).So total solutions: 2 +1 = 3. Yes, that's correct. So there are 3 three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 2. These numbers are 101, 110, and 200. Case 2: a + b + c = 11This is more complex. We need the number of three-digit numbers (a >=1, a <=9, b and c from 0 to9) such that a + b + c =11. We can use stars and bars here, but we have to account for the upper limits on the digits (each digit <=9). Since the maximum possible sum without considering upper limits is 9 + 9 + 9 =27, which is higher than 11, but individual digits can't exceed 9. However, 11 is less than 9 + 9 + 9 =27, so we need to check if any digit can exceed 9 in the solutions.But wait, the equation is a + b + c =11. Since each variable is at least 0 (with a >=1), the maximum any single digit can be is 11 (if the other two digits are 0). But since digits can only go up to 9, we need to subtract the cases where any digit exceeds 9.But first, let's compute the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =11 with a >=1. Let's substitute a' = a -1, so a' + b + c =10, with a' >=0, b >=0, c >=0. The number of solutions without considering the upper bounds is C(10 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(12, 2) = 66.But now we need to subtract the cases where a' >=9, b >=10, or c >=10.Wait, a' = a -1, and a <=9 (since a is a digit), so a' <=8. So if a' >=9, then a >=10, which is invalid. Similarly, if b >=10 or c >=10, those are invalid. So we need to subtract the number of solutions where a' >=9, b >=10, or c >=10.Let's compute the number of solutions where a' >=9. Let a'' = a' -9 >=0. Then the equation becomes a'' + b + c =10 -9 =1. The number of solutions is C(1 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(3,2)=3.Similarly, the number of solutions where b >=10: let b' = b -10 >=0, then a' + b' + c =10 -10=0. The number of solutions is C(0 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(2,2)=1.Same for c >=10: same as b >=10, which is 1 solution.However, we need to check if there are any overlaps where two variables exceed their limits. For example, can a' >=9 and b >=10 simultaneously? Let's see: a' >=9 implies a' >=9, and b >=10. Then the total sum a' + b + c >=9 +10 +0=19, but we have a' + b + c =10. Which is impossible. So there's no overlap. Similarly, overlaps between any two variables exceeding their limits would require the sum to be at least 9 +10 + something, which is already over 19, but our total is 10. So no overlaps. Similarly, all three exceeding is impossible.Therefore, the total number of invalid solutions is 3 (for a' >=9) +1 (for b >=10) +1 (for c >=10) =5. Therefore, the valid number of solutions is 66 -5=61.Therefore, there are 61 three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 11.Wait, let me verify this. Let's think of another way. Alternatively, since a, b, c are digits with a >=1, and a + b + c =11. We can model this as the equation a + b + c =11 where 1 <=a <=9, 0 <=b <=9, 0 <=c <=9. The standard stars and bars approach would say that the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative solutions to (a -1) + b + c =10, which is C(10 + 3 -1,3 -1) = C(12,2)=66. Then subtract the cases where a -1 >=9 (i.e., a >=10) which would be C(10 -9 + 3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3, and subtract cases where b >=10 (C(10 -10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(2,2)=1), and similarly for c >=10 (1). So total 66 -3 -1 -1=61. So that matches.Alternatively, another way: Let's use generating functions. The generating function for a (1<=a<=9) is x + x^2 + ... +x^9 = x(1 -x^9)/(1 -x). For b and c (0<=b,c<=9), it's 1 +x +x^2 + ... +x^9 = (1 -x^{10})/(1 -x). So the generating function is x(1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^3. We need the coefficient of x^{11} in this generating function.Expanding this, we can write it as x(1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...) / (1 -x)^3. The coefficient of x^{11} will be [x^{10}](1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...)/(1 -x)^3. The coefficient of x^{10} in 1/(1 -x)^3 is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66. Then subtract the coefficient of x^{10} in x^9/(1 -x)^3, which is [x^{10 -9}]/(1 -x)^3 = [x^1]/(1 -x)^3 = C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3. Then subtract 2 times the coefficient of x^{10} in x^{10}/(1 -x)^3, which is 2*[x^{0}]/(1 -x)^3=2*1=2. So total coefficient is 66 -3 -2=61. That matches again. So 61 solutions.Case 3: a + b + c =20Now, this is the case where the sum of digits is 20. Again, a three-digit number, so a >=1, a <=9, b and c from 0 to9. So a + b + c =20.We can use the same approach as before. Let's consider substituting a' = a -1, so a' + b + c =19, with a' >=0, b >=0, c >=0. But we need to account for the constraints a' <=8 (since a <=9 => a' <=8), b <=9, c <=9.So first, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c =19 without constraints is C(19 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(21,2)=210.Now, we need to subtract the cases where a' >=9, b >=10, or c >=10.First, compute the number of solutions where a' >=9. Let a'' = a' -9 >=0. Then the equation becomes a'' + b + c =19 -9=10. The number of solutions is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Next, the number of solutions where b >=10. Let b' =b -10 >=0. Then a' +b' +c =19 -10=9. The number of solutions is C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(11,2)=55.Similarly, the number of solutions where c >=10 is also 55.Now, we need to check for overlaps where two variables exceed their limits. For example, a' >=9 and b >=10. Let a''=a' -9 >=0 and b' =b -10 >=0. Then the equation becomes a'' +b' +c =19 -9 -10=0. The number of solutions is 1 (all zeros). Similarly, a' >=9 and c >=10 would also lead to a'' +c' +b =0, which has 1 solution. Similarly, b >=10 and c >=10: Let b' =b -10 and c' =c -10. Then the equation becomes a' +b' +c' =19 -10 -10= -1. Which is impossible. So there are no solutions here.Similarly, all three variables exceeding: a' >=9, b >=10, c >=10. Then the sum would be a'' +9 + b' +10 + c' +10 =a'' +b' +c' +29 =19 => a'' +b' +c' =-10, which is impossible. So no solutions.Therefore, the overlaps are only between a' >=9 and b >=10 (1 solution) and a' >=9 and c >=10 (1 solution). So total overlaps: 2.Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of invalid solutions is:(66 +55 +55) - (1 +1 +0) +0 =176 -2=174? Wait, wait, hold on.Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is:Total invalid = (number where a' >=9) + (number where b >=10) + (number where c >=10) - (number where a' >=9 and b >=10) - (number where a' >=9 and c >=10) - (number where b >=10 and c >=10) + (number where a' >=9 and b >=10 and c >=10)).So substituting numbers:Total invalid = 66 +55 +55 -1 -1 -0 +0=66 +55 +55=176, minus 1 -1=2, so 176 -2=174. Then, subtract this from the total 210.Wait, but 210 -174=36. But that seems low. Wait, let's check again.Wait, total solutions without constraints:210.Subtract the overcounts:Total invalid solutions calculated via inclusion-exclusion:First, subtract cases where a' >=9:66, b >=10:55, c >=10:55. Total subtracted:66 +55 +55=176.But then we have subtracted too much. The overlaps where two conditions are met have been subtracted twice, so we need to add them back once. The overlaps are:a' >=9 and b >=10:1 solutiona' >=9 and c >=10:1 solutionb >=10 and c >=10:0 solutionsSo total overlaps to add back:1 +1 +0=2.Then, subtract the overlaps where all three conditions are met, which is 0.Therefore, total invalid solutions =176 -2 +0=174. Wait, no, inclusion-exclusion formula is:Total invalid = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + (ABC))Where A is a' >=9, B is b >=10, C is c >=10.So:Total invalid =66 +55 +55 - (1 +1 +0) +0=176 -2=174.Therefore, the number of valid solutions is 210 -174=36.But let me check this with another method.Alternative approach: Using generating functions.The generating function is the same as before: x(1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2 / (1 -x)^3. We need the coefficient of x^{20} in this generating function.First, write it as x(1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...) / (1 -x)^3. Then, the coefficient of x^{20} is [x^{19}](1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...)/(1 -x)^3.The coefficient of x^{19} in 1/(1 -x)^3 is C(19 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(21,2)=210.Subtract the coefficient of x^{19 -9}=x^{10} in 1/(1 -x)^3, which is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Subtract 2 times the coefficient of x^{19 -10}=x^9 in 1/(1 -x)^3, which is 2*C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=2*C(11,2)=2*55=110.But wait, in the generating function, after factoring out x, the term is (1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...), so when expanding, we have:Coefficient of x^{20} in the generating function is:Coefficient of x^{19} in (1 -x^9 -2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3.Therefore, it's [x^{19}]/(1 -x)^3 - [x^{19 -9}]/(1 -x)^3 -2[x^{19 -10}]/(1 -x)^3= C(21,2) - C(12,2) -2*C(11,2) =210 -66 -110=210 -176=34.Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of 36. Which is a problem.Wait, so which is correct? The inclusion-exclusion gives 36, the generating function gives 34. Hmm. There must be a mistake in one of the methods.Wait, let's check the generating function approach again.Original generating function: x*(1 - x^9)*(1 - x^{10})^2 / (1 - x)^3.So, expanding the numerator:x*(1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + 2x^{19} + x^{20} - x^{29}) / (1 -x)^3.Wait, hold on, (1 -x^{10})^2 =1 -2x^{10} +x^{20}, so:x*(1 -x^9)*(1 -2x^{10} +x^{20}) =x*(1 -x^9 -2x^{10} +2x^{19} +x^{20} -x^{29})Therefore, the generating function is:x -x^{10} -2x^{11} +2x^{20} +x^{21} -x^{30} all over (1 -x)^3.Therefore, the coefficient of x^{20} in the generating function is:Coefficient of x^{20} in x/(1 -x)^3 - coefficient of x^{20} in x^{10}/(1 -x)^3 -2* coefficient of x^{20} in x^{11}/(1 -x)^3 +2* coefficient of x^{20} in x^{20}/(1 -x)^3 + coefficient of x^{20} in x^{21}/(1 -x)^3 - coefficient of x^{20} in x^{30}/(1 -x)^3.Calculating each term:1. Coefficient of x^{20} in x/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{19} in 1/(1 -x)^3 = C(19 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(21,2)=210.2. Coefficient of x^{20} in x^{10}/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{10} in 1/(1 -x)^3=C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.3. Coefficient of x^{20} in x^{11}/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{9} in 1/(1 -x)^3=C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(11,2)=55. Multiply by 2: 110.4. Coefficient of x^{20} in x^{20}/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{0} in 1/(1 -x)^3=1. Multiply by 2: 2.5. Coefficient of x^{20} in x^{21}/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{-1} in 1/(1 -x)^3=0.6. Coefficient of x^{20} in x^{30}/(1 -x)^3: Coefficient of x^{-10} in 1/(1 -x)^3=0.Therefore, total coefficient is 210 -66 -110 +2 +0 -0=210 -176 +2=36.Ah! So the generating function method gives 36. I must have made a mistake in the previous calculation. So the correct answer is 36. So where did I go wrong earlier?In the generating function approach, initially, I forgot to include the term from 2x^{20}/(1 -x)^3. So actually, the coefficient is 210 -66 -110 +2=36. Therefore, the correct answer is 36. So the inclusion-exclusion approach was correct, and the initial generating function approach missed the 2x^{20} term. Therefore, 36 is the correct number.Therefore, for Case 3, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 20 is 36.Total Number of SolutionsNow, adding up the three cases:Case 1: 3Case 2:61Case 3:36Total:3 +61 +36=100.Therefore, there are 100 three-digit numbers where S(S(n))=2.Wait, but let me verify this total once more.Wait, 3 +61=64, 64 +36=100. Yes. Hmm. 100 seems a round number. Let me check if there's another way to cross-validate.Alternatively, let's think about the possible values of S(n). We needed S(n) to be 2, 11, or 20. Now, the possible sums of digits for a three-digit number range from 1 (100) to 27 (999). So, the digit sums that have a digit sum of 2 are 2, 11, 20. So, if we can compute the number of three-digit numbers for each of these digit sums and add them, we get the total. Which we did, resulting in 3 +61 +36=100.Alternatively, let's check for some edge cases.For example, when S(n)=2: 101, 110, 200. That's 3 numbers, which matches.For S(n)=11, 61 numbers. Let's take a small example. For example, how many three-digit numbers with digits summing to 11. For example, 209: 2+0+9=11, 290, 902, 920, etc. 61 seems plausible.For S(n)=20, 36 numbers. For example, 992: 9+9+2=20, 983, 974, ..., 299. 36 numbers.Adding them up gives 100. Seems reasonable.Another way to check: The total number of three-digit numbers is 900 (from 100 to 999). So 100 is roughly 1/9 of the total. Given that S(S(n))=2 is a specific condition, 100 seems plausible.Alternatively, let's consider that S(S(n))=2. That is equivalent to S(n) ≡2 mod 9, because the sum of the digits function S(n) is congruent to n mod 9. Therefore, S(n) ≡2 mod 9. But S(n) can be 2, 11, 20, as before. Since S(n) is between 1 and 27, the possible S(n) are 2, 11, 20.Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with S(n) ≡2 mod9 is the same as the number of three-digit numbers where S(n)=2,11,20.So, the total numbers are the numbers of solutions for these three equations. Therefore, as calculated, 3+61+36=100.Therefore, the answer is 100.But let me check another angle. The number of three-digit numbers where S(n) ≡2 mod9. In general, the number of numbers with digit sum ≡k mod9 is roughly 1/9 of the total, but it might vary slightly. Since there are 900 three-digit numbers, 900/9=100. So that matches exactly. Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with S(n) ≡2 mod9 is exactly 100, which would mean that our answer is correct.Therefore, the final answer is 100.Final AnswerThe number of three-digit numbers for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) is boxed{100}.</think>To find the number of three-digit numbers ( n ) for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ), we need to determine the values of ( S(n) ) such that the sum of its digits is 2. These values are 2, 11, and 20. We then calculate the number of three-digit numbers for each of these digit sums and sum the results.1. Case 1: ( S(n) = 2 )   - We need the number of three-digit numbers ( abc ) (where ( a geq 1 )) such that ( a + b + c = 2 ).   - Substituting ( a' = a - 1 ), we solve ( a' + b + c = 1 ) for non-negative integers ( a', b, c ).   - The number of solutions is ( binom{1 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = binom{3}{2} = 3 ).2. Case 2: ( S(n) = 11 )   - We need the number of three-digit numbers ( abc ) such that ( a + b + c = 11 ).   - Substituting ( a' = a - 1 ), we solve ( a' + b + c = 10 ) for non-negative integers ( a', b, c ).   - Using stars and bars and subtracting invalid solutions, we find there are 61 valid solutions.3. Case 3: ( S(n) = 20 )   - We need the number of three-digit numbers ( abc ) such that ( a + b + c = 20 ).   - Substituting ( a' = a - 1 ), we solve ( a' + b + c = 19 ) for non-negative integers ( a', b, c ).   - Using stars and bars and subtracting invalid solutions, we find there are 36 valid solutions.Summing the results from all cases, we get:- ( 3 + 61 + 36 = 100 ).Thus, the number of three-digit numbers for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) is (boxed{100}).,<think>Okay, so the problem is: Find the number of 3-digit numbers where the sum of the digits of n, S(n), when you take the sum of its digits again, S(S(n)), equals 2. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the notation. For any natural number n, S(n) is the sum of its digits. Then S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of that sum. So, for example, if n is 123, then S(n) is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and then S(S(n)) is 6 (since 6 is a single-digit number, the sum of its digits is itself). So in this case, S(S(n)) would be 6, which is not equal to 2. So 123 wouldn't be counted.We need to find all 3-digit numbers where S(S(n)) = 2. That means that when you sum the digits of n, and then sum the digits of that sum, you get 2. So, first, let's think about what S(n) must be for S(S(n)) to be 2.If S(S(n)) = 2, then S(n) must be a number whose digits add up to 2. What numbers satisfy that? Well, the sum of the digits of S(n) is 2, so S(n) itself could be 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, 200, etc. However, since n is a 3-digit number, the maximum possible S(n) would be 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. So S(n) can't be more than 27. Therefore, the possible values for S(n) are numbers where their digits sum to 2 and are less than or equal to 27. Let's list those.Possible S(n) values: 2, 11, 20. Because 2 is a single-digit number, sum of digits is 2. 11 is 1+1=2. 20 is 2+0=2. Then the next would be 101, but 101 is way larger than 27, so that's not possible. So only 2, 11, and 20.Therefore, S(n) must be either 2, 11, or 20. So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of 3-digit numbers n where the sum of its digits S(n) is either 2, 11, or 20. Then, we can add those quantities together.So, we need to compute three separate quantities:1. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 2.2. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 11.3. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 20.Then, add them up to get the total. Let me tackle each one by one.Starting with the first: number of 3-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 2.A 3-digit number is from 100 to 999. So the first digit (hundreds place) can be 1-9, and the other two digits (tens and units) can be 0-9.We need to find the number of solutions to a + b + c = 2, where a is from 1-9 and b, c are from 0-9. Since a is at least 1, we can let a' = a - 1, so a' is from 0-8. Then the equation becomes a' + 1 + b + c = 2 => a' + b + c = 1, where a' is 0-8, and b, c are 0-9. Now, we need the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c = 1 with a' ≤ 8, b ≤ 9, c ≤ 9.Since the sum is 1, the upper bounds (8, 9, 9) won't restrict the solutions because each variable can only be 0 or 1, and 1 is less than all upper bounds. So the number of solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3. However, since a' can be 0-8, but a' can only be 0 or 1 here. Similarly, b and c can only be 0 or 1. So, the solutions are:a' = 0, b = 0, c = 1a' = 0, b = 1, c = 0a' = 1, b = 0, c = 0But a' can be up to 8, but since the sum is 1, a' can only be 0 or 1, which is within the allowed range. So there are 3 solutions. Translating back to original variables:a = a' + 1. So:If a' = 0, then a = 1, and the number is 1 followed by b and c: 1 0 1 or 1 1 0.If a' = 1, then a = 2, and the number is 2 0 0.So the numbers are 101, 110, and 200. So that's 3 numbers. So that's the first part: 3 numbers with digit sum 2.Wait, hold on. Wait, sum of digits is 2. The three numbers are 101 (1+0+1=2), 110 (1+1+0=2), and 200 (2+0+0=2). That's correct. So first part is 3.Moving on to the second part: number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 11.So, need to solve a + b + c = 11, where a is 1-9, b and c are 0-9.Again, we can use stars and bars, but considering the constraints.First, transform the equation by letting a' = a - 1, so a' is 0-8. Then, equation becomes a' + 1 + b + c = 11 => a' + b + c = 10, where a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.We need the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c = 10 with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion.Total solutions without constraints: C(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 66.Now subtract the solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.First, compute the number of solutions where a' ≥9. Let a'' = a' - 9, so a'' ≥0. Then equation becomes a'' + 9 + b + c = 10 => a'' + b + c =1. The number of solutions is C(1 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(3,2)=3.Similarly, solutions where b ≥10. Let b' = b -10, so b' ≥0. Then equation becomes a' + b' +10 + c =10 => a' + b' + c =0. Only one solution: a'=0, b'=0, c=0. So 1 solution.Same for c ≥10: 1 solution.Now, subtract these: 66 - 3 -1 -1 = 61.But now we have to add back the cases where two constraints are violated, since they were subtracted twice. However, check if any two constraints can be violated simultaneously.If a' ≥9 and b ≥10: Then, a'' + b' + c =10 -9 -10 = -9, which is impossible. Similarly, any two constraints would result in a negative total, so no solutions. Thus, no overlaps. So total solutions are 66 -3 -1 -1 =61.Therefore, there are 61 solutions. But wait, let me check if this is correct.Wait, the formula for inclusion-exclusion is Total = All solutions - (solutions violating a') - (solutions violating b) - (solutions violating c) + (solutions violating a' and b) + ... - ... But since in this case, violating two constraints is impossible, as explained, so no need to add anything back. Hence, the total is indeed 61.But let's verify this with another approach.Alternatively, since a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.We can model this as a' ≤8, so a' can be 0-8, and b and c can be 0-9.So for a' from 0 to8, and for each a', the sum b + c =10 -a'.But b and c must be between 0 and9.So for each a', the number of solutions for b + c =10 - a', with 0 ≤b,c ≤9.So let's iterate a' from 0 to8, compute the number of (b,c) pairs where b + c =10 -a', and 0 ≤b,c ≤9.Let's compute for each a':Case 1: a' =0. Then b + c =10. Number of solutions where b and c are between0-9. For b from0-9, c=10 -b. c must be between0-9. So 10 -b ≥0 => b ≤10. But b ≤9, so c=10 -b ≥1. So possible b=0 to9, but c=10 -b would be 10-0=10 (invalid) down to 10-9=1. Wait, wait. Wait, if b + c =10, and both b and c are from0-9, then possible solutions are when b=1 to9, c=9 downto1. Wait, actually:Wait, for b + c =10, the possible (b,c) pairs with b,c ≥0 and ≤9 are:(1,9), (2,8), ..., (9,1). So that's 9 solutions.Similarly, if a'=1, then b + c =9. Then possible pairs: (0,9), (1,8), ..., (9,0). But since b and c can be 0-9, there are 10 solutions (from 0 to9 in b, c=9 -b).But wait, b and c can be 0-9, so for b + c =9, there are 10 solutions: 0+9, 1+8, ...,9+0.Similarly, for a'=2, b + c=8: 9 solutions? Wait, no. Wait, same reasoning:b + c=8. So possible pairs are (0,8), (1,7), ..., (8,0). So 9 solutions.Wait, no: 0+8, 1+7,...,8+0: that's 9 solutions. Wait, but if allowed up to 9, but 8 +0 is the last. So 9 solutions.Wait, but if the sum is s, then the number of non-negative integer solutions is s +1. But when restricted to ≤9, if s ≤9, then all solutions are valid, so s +1.But wait, for example, when a'=1, sum=9: solutions are 0+9 to9+0. But 0+9 is allowed (since c=9 is allowed), and 9+0 is allowed. So 10 solutions. Wait, but earlier when a'=0, sum=10, we had 9 solutions because 0+10 is invalid (c=10), so only from1+9 to9+1. So 9 solutions.Wait, so the number of solutions for b + c =k, where 0 ≤b,c ≤9, is:If k ≤9: (k +1) solutions, from (0,k) to (k,0).If k ≥10: (19 -k) solutions, since from (k -9,9) down to (9, k -9). For example, when k=10: 1+9, ...,9+1: 9 solutions.So, in general, for k from0 to18 (since b and c can each be up to9), the number of solutions is:If k ≤9: k +1If k ≥10: 19 -kTherefore, applying this:For a given a', compute k =10 -a', then compute number of solutions for b + c =k.So, for each a' from0 to8:a'=0: k=10: 19 -10=9 solutionsa'=1: k=9:9 +1=10 solutionsa'=2: k=8:8 +1=9 solutionsa'=3: k=7:7 +1=8 solutionsWait, wait. Wait, when a'=3, k=10 -3=7. Since k=7 ≤9, so solutions =7 +1=8.Similarly:a'=0: k=10, solutions=9a'=1: k=9, solutions=10a'=2: k=8, solutions=9a'=3: k=7, solutions=8a'=4: k=6, solutions=7a'=5: k=5, solutions=6a'=6: k=4, solutions=5a'=7: k=3, solutions=4a'=8: k=2, solutions=3So let's sum these up:a'=0:9a'=1:10a'=2:9a'=3:8a'=4:7a'=5:6a'=6:5a'=7:4a'=8:3Adding these together:Start from a'=0:9+ a'=1:10 → total 19+ a'=2:9 → 28+ a'=3:8 →36+ a'=4:7 →43+ a'=5:6 →49+ a'=6:5 →54+ a'=7:4 →58+ a'=8:3 →61So total solutions is 61, which matches the inclusion-exclusion result. Good, so that's reassuring.Therefore, the number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 11 is 61.Now, moving on to the third part: number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 20.Again, we need to solve a + b + c =20, where a is 1-9, b and c 0-9.Let me transform variables again. Let a' = a -1, so a' is 0-8. Then equation becomes a' +1 +b +c=20 => a' + b + c=19, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.We need the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c=19 with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.Using inclusion-exclusion again.Total solutions without constraints: C(19 +3 -1, 3 -1) = C(21,2)=210.Now subtract the solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.First, compute number of solutions where a' ≥9. Let a''=a' -9, so a'' ≥0. Then equation becomes a'' +9 +b +c=19 ⇒ a'' +b +c=10. The number of solutions is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Solutions where b ≥10: Let b'=b -10. Then equation becomes a' + b' +10 +c=19 ⇒a' +b' +c=9. The number of solutions is C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(11,2)=55.Similarly, solutions where c ≥10: same as b ≥10, so 55.Now, subtract these: 210 -66 -55 -55=210 -176=34.But now we need to add back the cases where two constraints are violated.Compute solutions where a' ≥9 and b ≥10. Let a''=a' -9, b'=b -10. Then equation becomes a'' +9 +b' +10 +c=19 ⇒a'' +b' +c=0. Only one solution: a''=0, b'=0, c=0. So 1 solution.Similarly, solutions where a' ≥9 and c ≥10:1 solution.Solutions where b ≥10 and c ≥10: equation becomes a' +b' +10 +c' +10=19 ⇒a' +b' +c'= -1, which is impossible. So 0 solutions.Thus, add back 1 +1 +0=2.Now subtract 34 +2=36.Wait, no. Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is Total = All - (A + B + C) + (AB + AC + BC) - ABC.So here:Total = 210Subtract (66 +55 +55)=186Add back (1 +1 +0)=2Subtract solutions where all three constraints are violated, which would be a' ≥9, b ≥10, c ≥10. But as above, solving a'' +9 +b' +10 +c' +10=19 ⇒a'' +b' +c'= -10, which is impossible. So 0.Thus, total solutions=210 -186 +2 -0=26.Wait, that gives 26? But when I compute 210 -66 -55 -55 +1 +1 +0=210 -176 +2=36. Wait, now I'm confused.Wait, maybe I messed up the inclusion-exclusion steps.Wait, let's do it step by step.First, total solutions:210.Subtract the overcounts where a' >=9 (66), b >=10 (55), c >=10 (55). So 210 -66 -55 -55 =34.Now, add back the cases where two constraints are violated:a' >=9 and b >=10:1a' >=9 and c >=10:1b >=10 and c >=10:0Total to add back:1+1+0=2.So 34 +2=36.Now subtract the cases where all three constraints are violated:0.Thus, total solutions=36.But earlier, when I tried the alternative approach, in another problem, I think this can also be calculated by considering the possible values.Alternatively, let's model it by iterating over a' from0-8, and for each a', compute the number of (b,c) such that b +c=19 -a', with b,c <=9.So for a' from0 to8, and for each a', k=19 -a'.Since a' is from0-8, k=19 -a' is from19-0=19 down to19-8=11.So k is from11 to19. But since b and c are at most9, the sum b +c can be at most18. So k=19 is impossible. Therefore, for a'=0, k=19. Since b +c=19, but maximum b +c=18, so no solutions.Similarly, a'=1: k=18. b +c=18. Which requires b=9 and c=9. So only one solution: b=9, c=9.a'=2: k=17. Then b +c=17. Since b,c <=9. So possible pairs are (8,9) and (9,8). So two solutions.a'=3: k=16. b +c=16. Possible pairs: (7,9), (8,8), (9,7). Three solutions.a'=4: k=15. b +c=15. Pairs: (6,9), (7,8), (8,7), (9,6). Four solutions.a'=5: k=14. b +c=14. Pairs: (5,9), (6,8), (7,7), (8,6), (9,5). Five solutions.a'=6: k=13. b +c=13. Pairs: (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4). Six solutions.a'=7: k=12. b +c=12. Pairs: (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3). Seven solutions.a'=8: k=11. b +c=11. Pairs: (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). Eight solutions.So let's tally these up:a'=0:0a'=1:1a'=2:2a'=3:3a'=4:4a'=5:5a'=6:6a'=7:7a'=8:8Total=0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36.So that's 36 solutions, which matches the inclusion-exclusion result of 36. Therefore, the number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum20 is36.Therefore, putting it all together:Number of 3-digit numbers with S(S(n))=2 is the number of numbers with S(n)=2,11,20. So 3 +61 +36=100.Wait, 3 +61 is64, plus36 is100. So the total number is100. Is that correct?But let me check again. For S(n)=2:3 numbers.For S(n)=11:61 numbers.For S(n)=20:36 numbers.Total:3+61=64, 64+36=100.Hmm, but is there a possibility of overlap? For example, could a number have S(n)=2 and S(n)=11? No, because S(n) is a specific number. Each number has a unique digit sum. So no overlaps. Therefore, adding them is correct.Therefore, the answer is100.But let me check with an example.Take a number like 299. Its digits sum to2+9+9=20. Then S(S(n))=2+0=2, so that's counted. Similarly, 992 same.For S(n)=11: take 119, 1+1+9=11, S(S(n))=1+1=2. So that's counted.For S(n)=2: like 200, which is 2+0+0=2, then S(S(n))=2.So all these numbers are correctly included.But wait, 3+61+36=100. Let me check if these counts are correct.For S(n)=2:3 numbers (101,110,200). Correct.For S(n)=11:61 numbers. Let me verify with another approach. Wait, when we did the stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion, and the alternative approach of summing over a', both gave 61. So that seems correct.Similarly, S(n)=20:36 numbers. Both methods gave 36. So that's correct.Therefore, total 100 numbers. Therefore, the answer is boxed{100}.Final Answerboxed{100}</think>To find the number of 3-digit numbers ( n ) such that ( S(S(n)) = 2 ), we need to determine the values of ( S(n) ) that satisfy this condition. The possible values for ( S(n) ) are 2, 11, and 20, since these are the only numbers less than or equal to 27 (the maximum sum of digits for a 3-digit number) whose digits sum to 2.1. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 2:   - The possible numbers are 101, 110, and 200.   - Count: 32. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 11:   - We need to solve ( a + b + c = 11 ) where ( a ) is 1-9 and ( b, c ) are 0-9.   - Using stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion, we find there are 61 solutions.   - Count: 613. Number of 3-digit numbers with digit sum 20:   - We need to solve ( a + b + c = 20 ) where ( a ) is 1-9 and ( b, c ) are 0-9.   - Using stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion, we find there are 36 solutions.   - Count: 36Adding these results together, we get the total number of 3-digit numbers ( n ) such that ( S(S(n)) = 2 ):[3 + 61 + 36 = 100]Thus, the number of 3-digit numbers for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) is (boxed{100}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the number of three-digit numbers n where the sum of the digits of n, when you sum them again, equals 2. That is, S(S(n)) = 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. For a three-digit number n, which can be written as abc (where a, b, c are digits and a is not zero), S(n) would be a + b + c. Then, S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of the number a + b + c. And this should equal 2. So, first I need to compute S(n) = a + b + c, then sum the digits of that result, and check if it's 2. So, the question is, how many three-digit numbers abc satisfy S(S(n)) = 2.Wait, but S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of S(n). But S(n) is a number between 1 (if a=1 and b=c=0) and 27 (if a=b=c=9). So, S(n) can be any number from 1 to 27. Then, S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of that number. For example, if S(n) is 19, then S(S(n)) would be 1 + 9 = 10, which is not 2. If S(n) is 20, then S(S(n)) is 2 + 0 = 2. So, in that case, it would satisfy the condition.So, in order for S(S(n)) to be 2, the sum S(n) must be a number whose digits add up to 2. So, S(n) could be 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, etc. But wait, since S(n) is between 1 and 27, the possible values for S(n) that have digit sum 2 are 2, 11, and 20. Because 101 and 110 are way larger than 27, so they can't occur. So, S(n) must be 2, 11, or 20. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of three-digit numbers n where S(n) is either 2, 11, or 20.Therefore, I need to compute the number of three-digit numbers with digit sums 2, 11, or 20, and then sum those counts. So, three separate calculations: count numbers with S(n) = 2, count numbers with S(n) = 11, count numbers with S(n) = 20, add them together.Let me start with S(n) = 2. How many three-digit numbers have digits adding up to 2?A three-digit number is of the form abc, where a is from 1 to 9, and b and c are from 0 to 9. We need a + b + c = 2.Since a is at least 1, the possible values for a are 1 or 2. If a = 1, then b + c = 1. If a = 2, then b + c = 0.For a = 1, b + c = 1. The number of non-negative integer solutions is (1 + 2 - 1 choose 2 - 1) = 2. Wait, no, more carefully: For b and c being digits (0 to 9), how many solutions to b + c = 1. The solutions are (0,1), (1,0). So two solutions.For a = 2, b + c = 0. The only solution is (0,0). So one solution.Therefore, total numbers with S(n) = 2: 2 + 1 = 3.Now, S(n) = 11. How many three-digit numbers have digits adding up to 11?This is a more standard stars and bars problem. Let's set up the equation a + b + c = 11, where a is from 1 to 9, and b, c from 0 to 9.First, if we consider variables a' = a - 1, so a' ranges from 0 to 8. Then the equation becomes a' + 1 + b + c = 11 => a' + b + c = 10, where a' is from 0 to 8, and b, c from 0 to 9.We can use stars and bars to compute the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c = 10, with a' ≤ 8, b ≤ 9, c ≤ 9.First, compute the total number of solutions without restrictions: C(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 66.Now subtract the solutions where a' ≥ 9, b ≥ 10, or c ≥ 10.But let's compute the number of solutions where a' ≥ 9. If a' ≥ 9, set a'' = a' - 9, so a'' ≥ 0. Then the equation becomes a'' + 9 + b + c = 10 => a'' + b + c = 1. The number of solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.Similarly, for b ≥ 10: set b' = b - 10. Then a' + b' + c = 10 - 10 = 0. So the equation is a' + b' + c = 0. The only solution is a' = 0, b' = 0, c = 0. So 1 solution. Similarly for c ≥ 10: 1 solution.So total solutions violating the constraints: 3 (from a' ≥9) + 1 (from b ≥10) + 1 (from c ≥10) = 5. However, we need to check if there are overlaps where two constraints are violated simultaneously. For example, if a' ≥9 and b ≥10. Then a' ≥9, b ≥10, so a'' = a' -9 ≥0, b' = b -10 ≥0. Then the equation becomes a'' +9 + b' +10 + c =10 => a'' + b' + c = -9, which is impossible. Similarly, any two constraints would lead to a negative right-hand side. So no overlaps. Therefore, total invalid solutions: 5.Therefore, the valid number of solutions is 66 - 5 = 61.But wait, let me verify this again. The original problem is a' + b + c =10, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9. Using inclusion-exclusion:Total solutions: C(12,2)=66.Subtract solutions where a' ≥9: C(12 -9 + 2, 2) = C(5,2)=10? Wait, no, that's for a different approach. Wait, maybe my initial approach was incorrect.Wait, when using inclusion-exclusion for upper bounds, it's a bit tricky. Let me recall the standard formula. For equations x1 + x2 + ... + xn = k, with xi ≤ mi, the number of solutions can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion, subtracting the solutions where each xi exceeds mi.But in this case, our equation is a' + b + c =10, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9. So we need to subtract the number of solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.For a' ≥9: set a'' = a' -9, then a'' + b + c =1. Number of solutions: C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3.For b ≥10: set b' =b -10, then a' + b' + c =0. Solutions: C(0 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(2,2)=1.Similarly for c ≥10: 1.No overlaps as before. So total invalid solutions:3+1+1=5.Therefore, valid solutions:66 -5=61. So the number of solutions is 61. Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 11 is 61.Wait, but let me check with another approach. For example, generating functions. The generating function for a' is (1 + x + ... +x^8), for b and c is (1 +x + ... +x^9). So the generating function is (1 +x + ... +x^8)(1 +x + ... +x^9)^2. The coefficient of x^10 in this product.Alternatively, compute the coefficient of x^10 in (1 -x^9)/(1 -x) * (1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^2) = (1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2)/(1 -x)^3.So coefficient of x^10 in (1 -x^9)(1 -2x^{10} +x^{20})/(1 -x)^3.So expanding, we have (1)(1)/(1 -x)^3 - (1)(2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3 - (x^9)(1)/(1 -x)^3 + (x^9)(2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3 + (x^9)(x^{20})/(1 -x)^3 - ... But beyond x^{10}, higher terms won't contribute to x^10.So, effectively, coefficient of x^10 in (1 -x^9 -2x^{10} + ...)/(1 -x)^3.So, the coefficient is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1) - C(10 -9 +3 -1,3 -1) - 2*C(10 -10 +3 -1,3 -1).Which is C(12,2) - C(4,2) - 2*C(2,2).C(12,2)=66, C(4,2)=6, C(2,2)=1.Therefore, 66 -6 -2*1=66 -6 -2=58. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of 61.Hmm, so there must be a mistake here. Which approach is correct?Wait, in the generating function approach, when you expand (1 -x^9)(1 -2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3, the coefficient of x^10 is [x^10](1/(1 -x)^3) - [x^10](x^9/(1 -x)^3) -2[x^10](x^{10}/(1 -x)^3) +2[x^10](x^{19}/(1 -x)^3).But x^{19} is beyond x^{10}, so those terms are zero.Thus, coefficient is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1) - C(10 -9 +3 -1,3 -1) -2*C(10 -10 +3 -1,3 -1).Which is C(12,2) - C(4,2) -2*C(2,2) =66 -6 -2=58. But this contradicts the inclusion-exclusion result of 61.So which one is correct? There must be an error in one of the methods. Let me check the inclusion-exclusion again.Original equation: a' + b + c =10, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.Total solutions without constraints: C(12,2)=66.Subtract solutions where a' ≥9: let a'' =a' -9 ≥0. Then equation becomes a'' + b + c =1. Number of solutions: C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3. Correct.Subtract solutions where b ≥10: let b' =b -10 ≥0. Then equation becomes a' + b' + c =0. Solutions:1. Correct.Same for c ≥10:1.Total subtracted:3+1+1=5. So 66 -5=61. But generating function gives 58. There's a conflict.Alternatively, maybe my generating function approach is wrong. Let's see. The generating function is (1 +x +...x^8)(1 +x +...x^9)^2.Compute coefficient of x^10. Alternatively, note that (1 +x +...x^8) = (1 -x^9)/(1 -x), and (1 +x +...x^9)^2 = (1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^2.Therefore, the generating function is (1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^3.Expanding this, we get (1 -x^9 -2x^{10} +2x^{19} +x^{20} -x^{29})/(1 -x)^3. But when we are looking for the coefficient of x^10, we only need to consider terms up to x^10. So, it's (1 -x^9 -2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3 + higher terms.Therefore, the coefficient of x^10 is equal to the coefficient of x^10 in (1 -x^9 -2x^{10})/(1 -x)^3.Which is equal to [x^10]1/(1 -x)^3 - [x^10]x^9/(1 -x)^3 -2[x^10]x^{10}/(1 -x)^3.Now, [x^10]1/(1 -x)^3 is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.[x^10]x^9/(1 -x)^3 = [x^{1}]1/(1 -x)^3=C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3.Similarly, [x^10]x^{10}/(1 -x)^3 = [x^0]1/(1 -x)^3=1.Therefore, the total coefficient is 66 -3 -2*1=66 -3 -2=61. Wait, so here it's 61. But previously I thought it was 58 because of a miscalculation.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the prior generating function step. Let me recast.Wait, the generating function is (1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^3. Then expanding, we have:(1)(1)/(1 -x)^3 - (x^9)(1)/(1 -x)^3 - 2(1)(x^{10})/(1 -x)^3 + 2x^{19}/(1 -x)^3 + x^{20}/(1 -x)^3 - x^{29}/(1 -x)^3.But when taking coefficients up to x^{10}, only the first three terms matter:Coeff x^10 in (1/(1 -x)^3) - Coeff x^10 in (x^9/(1 -x)^3) - 2*Coeff x^10 in (x^{10}/(1 -x)^3).Which is 66 -3 -2*1=61. So that's correct. Therefore, the generating function approach actually gives 61, which matches inclusion-exclusion. So my prior mistake was in the expansion step, not considering correctly the coefficients.Therefore, 61 is the correct number. So the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 11 is 61. Got it.Now, moving on to S(n)=20. How many three-digit numbers have digits adding up to 20?Again, a three-digit number abc, with a from 1 to 9, b and c from 0 to 9. So a + b + c =20.We can approach this similarly. Let's set a'=a-1, so a' ranges from 0 to 8. Then the equation becomes a' +1 +b +c=20 => a' +b +c=19, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.So, need to compute the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c =19, with a' ≤8, b ≤9, c ≤9.Again, using inclusion-exclusion.Total solutions without constraints: C(19 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(21,2)=210.Subtract the solutions where a' ≥9, b ≥10, or c ≥10.First, compute the number of solutions where a' ≥9. Let a''=a'-9, so a'' ≥0. Then equation becomes a'' +9 +b +c=19 => a'' +b +c=10. The number of solutions is C(10 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(12,2)=66.Number of solutions where b ≥10: set b'=b-10. Then a' +b' +c=19 -10=9. The number of solutions is C(9 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(11,2)=55. Similarly for c ≥10:55.Now, check for overlaps. Overlaps occur when two variables exceed their limits. For example, a' ≥9 and b ≥10. Then set a''=a'-9, b'=b-10, so a'' + b' +c=19 -9 -10=0. The number of solutions is 1 (all zeros). Similarly, a' ≥9 and c ≥10:1 solution. Similarly, b ≥10 and c ≥10: set b'=b-10, c'=c-10, so a' +b' +c'=19 -10 -10= -1, which is impossible. So no solutions there. Similarly, all three exceeding: a' ≥9, b ≥10, c ≥10 leads to a'' +b' +c'=19 -9 -10 -10= -10, impossible.Therefore, overlapping solutions: only two cases where a' ≥9 and b ≥10, and a' ≥9 and c ≥10, each with 1 solution.Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion:Total invalid solutions = (66 +55 +55) - (1 +1 +0) +0= 176 -2=174.Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is:Invalid solutions = (solutions where a' ≥9 + solutions where b ≥10 + solutions where c ≥10) - (solutions where a' ≥9 and b ≥10 + solutions where a' ≥9 and c ≥10 + solutions where b ≥10 and c ≥10) + (solutions where a' ≥9 and b ≥10 and c ≥10))From above:Solutions where a' ≥9:66Solutions where b ≥10:55Solutions where c ≥10:55Sum:66+55+55=176Solutions where a' ≥9 and b ≥10:1Solutions where a' ≥9 and c ≥10:1Solutions where b ≥10 and c ≥10:0Sum:1+1+0=2Solutions where all three exceed:0Thus, invalid solutions=176 -2 +0=174Therefore, valid solutions=Total solutions - invalid solutions=210 -174=36.Wait, so 36 three-digit numbers have digit sum 20.Let me check with generating functions again. Generating function for a' is (1 +x +...x^8), for b and c is (1 +x +...x^9). So the generating function is (1 +x +...x^8)(1 +x +...x^9)^2. The coefficient of x^19 here.Expressed as (1 -x^9)/(1 -x) * (1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^2 = (1 -x^9)(1 -x^{10})^2/(1 -x)^3.Expanding, the coefficient of x^19 is [x^19](1/(1 -x)^3) - [x^19](x^9/(1 -x)^3) -2[x^{19}](x^{10}/(1 -x)^3) +2[x^{19}](x^{19}/(1 -x)^3) + [x^{19}](x^{20}/(1 -x)^3) - [x^{19}](x^{29}/(1 -x)^3).But terms beyond x^19 can be ignored. So,Coefficient is C(19 +3 -1,3 -1) - C(19 -9 +3 -1,3 -1) -2*C(19 -10 +3 -1,3 -1) +2*C(19 -19 +3 -1,3 -1).Wait, wait:First term: C(21,2)=210Second term: C(19 -9=10 +2,2)=C(12,2)=66Third term: 2*C(19 -10=9 +2,2)=2*C(11,2)=2*55=110Fourth term: 2*C(19 -19=0 +2,2)=2*C(2,2)=2*1=2Fifth term: [x^{19}]x^{20}/(1 -x)^3 is zero.Last term: irrelevant.Therefore, coefficient=210 -66 -110 +2=210 -176 +2=36. Which matches the inclusion-exclusion result. So 36 is correct.Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 20 is 36.So, summarizing:- S(n)=2:3 numbers- S(n)=11:61 numbers- S(n)=20:36 numbersTherefore, total numbers where S(S(n))=2 is 3 +61 +36=100.Wait, 3+61 is 64, 64+36=100. So the answer would be 100.But wait, let me check if there's any overlap. Could a number have S(n) equal to both 2,11,20? Since S(n) is unique for each number, a number can only have one digit sum. Therefore, no overlaps. So adding them is okay.Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers where S(S(n))=2 is 3 +61 +36=100.But wait, let me check if there's an alternative approach. For example, S(S(n))=2 implies that S(n) is 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, etc. But since S(n) is between 1 and 27, as we established, the only possibilities are 2,11,20. Therefore, adding the numbers for these cases gives the total. So 3 +61 +36=100. Seems correct.But let me verify with a small example. Suppose we consider two-digit numbers. Wait, no, problem is three-digit. Alternatively, check if the counts make sense.For S(n)=2: only 3 numbers: 101, 110, 200. Wait, but hold on: 101 is 1+0+1=2, 110 is 1+1+0=2, 200 is 2+0+0=2. So yes, three numbers. Correct.For S(n)=11: 61 numbers. Seems reasonable. For example, numbers like 902 (9+0+2=11), 911 (9+1+1=11), etc. There are a lot of combinations here.For S(n)=20: 36 numbers. For example, 992 (9+9+2=20), 983, 974, ..., 299. So 36 seems reasonable.Adding them up gives 100. Therefore, the answer is 100.But let me cross-verify with another method. Let's note that S(S(n))=2. Which is equivalent to S(n) ≡2 mod 9, because the sum of digits function S(n) ≡n mod 9. Therefore, S(S(n)) ≡S(n) mod 9. Therefore, if S(S(n))=2, then S(n) ≡2 mod 9. So S(n) can be 2,11,20. Which are the numbers we considered. Therefore, the numbers with S(n) ≡2 mod9. Therefore, total number is the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum congruent to 2 mod9. But we need specifically S(S(n))=2, so S(n) must be 2,11,20. Since S(n) can't be 29 (as maximum digit sum is 27). So yes, same result.Alternatively, the number of three-digit numbers with S(n) ≡2 mod9. Then, in mod9, the number of solutions to a + b + c ≡2 mod9, where a ∈1-9, b,c ∈0-9. The total number of three-digit numbers is 900 (from 100 to 999). Since the digits are uniformly distributed modulo9, approximately 1/9 of them would be in each residue. So 900 /9=100. Therefore, the exact number is 100. Therefore, this matches our previous result.Therefore, the answer should be 100. Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers where S(S(n))=2 is boxed{100}.Final Answerboxed{100}</think>To find the number of three-digit numbers ( n ) for which ( S(S(n)) = 2 ), we need to determine the values of ( S(n) ) such that the sum of its digits equals 2.

The expression given is A equals (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x) divided by (1 - tan x). We need to calculate the value of A when cos x is -4/5 and x is in the second quadrant, between π/2 and π. The answer needs to be exact, so I can't just approximate with decimals. First, let's recall some trigonometric identities. The expression has sin 2x, cos 2x, and tan x. I remember that sin 2x is 2 sin x cos x, and cos 2x can be written in a few different forms, like cos²x - sin²x or 2 cos²x - 1 or 1 - 2 sin²x. Also, tan x is sin x over cos x. Since we know cos x is -4/5, maybe we can find sin x first using the Pythagorean identity. Given cos x = -4/5 and x is in the second quadrant (π/2 < x < π), so sin x should be positive here because in the second quadrant, sine is positive and cosine is negative. Let me confirm that. Yes, in the second quadrant, sine is positive and cosine is negative. So sin x = sqrt(1 - cos²x). Let's compute that.cos x = -4/5, so cos²x = (16/25). Then sin²x = 1 - 16/25 = 9/25, so sin x is 3/5. Since x is in the second quadrant, sin x is positive, so sin x = 3/5.Now, let's compute tan x. tan x = sin x / cos x = (3/5)/(-4/5) = -3/4. So tan x is -3/4. That might be useful later.Now, let's look at the numerator of A: (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x). Let's compute each term. First, sin 2x. Using the identity sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x. We have sin x = 3/5 and cos x = -4/5. Therefore, sin 2x = 2*(3/5)*(-4/5) = 2*(-12/25) = -24/25. So (1/2 sin 2x) is (1/2)*(-24/25) = -12/25.Next, cos 2x. Let's pick one of the identities. Let's use cos 2x = 2 cos²x - 1. cos²x is 16/25, so 2*(16/25) - 1 = 32/25 - 1 = 32/25 - 25/25 = 7/25. Alternatively, using cos 2x = 1 - 2 sin²x, which would be 1 - 2*(9/25) = 1 - 18/25 = 7/25. Same result. So cos 2x is 7/25. Therefore, the numerator is (-12/25 + 7/25) = (-12 + 7)/25 = (-5)/25 = -1/5.Now the denominator of A is (1 - tan x). We found tan x is -3/4, so 1 - (-3/4) = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4.Therefore, A = numerator / denominator = (-1/5) / (7/4) = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35.Wait, but that seems straightforward, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the numerator.Wait, numerator: (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x). We calculated sin 2x as -24/25. Then 1/2 sin 2x is indeed -12/25. Then cos 2x is 7/25. Adding those gives -12/25 + 7/25 = -5/25 = -1/5. That's correct. Denominator: 1 - tan x = 1 - (-3/4) = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4. So A is (-1/5)/(7/4) = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35. But wait, let's double-check all steps. Let's verify each part again.First, sin x and cos x:cos x = -4/5, so sin x is sqrt(1 - cos²x) = sqrt(1 - 16/25) = sqrt(9/25) = 3/5. Since x is in π/2 to π, sin x is positive. Correct.tan x = sin x / cos x = (3/5)/(-4/5) = -3/4. Correct.sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2*(3/5)*(-4/5) = -24/25. Correct.1/2 sin 2x = (1/2)*(-24/25) = -12/25. Correct.cos 2x: 2 cos²x - 1 = 2*(16/25) -1 = 32/25 -25/25 =7/25. Correct.Adding them: -12/25 +7/25 = -5/25 = -1/5. Correct.Denominator:1 - tan x =1 - (-3/4) =7/4. Correct.Dividing: (-1/5)/(7/4) = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35. But wait, is there a sign error? Let me check again. The numerator is -1/5 and the denominator is 7/4. So when we divide, it's (-1/5) divided by (7/4) which is equal to (-1/5) multiplied by (4/7), which is -4/35. So yes, that's correct.But maybe I should check if there's another way to approach the problem, perhaps simplifying the expression A before plugging in the values. Maybe that could help avoid errors.Let me see. The original expression is A = [ (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x) ] / [1 - tan x]. Maybe we can manipulate this expression using trigonometric identities to simplify it before substituting values. Let's try.First, let's note that tan x = sin x / cos x. So 1 - tan x = 1 - sin x / cos x = (cos x - sin x)/cos x. Therefore, the denominator is (cos x - sin x)/cos x.The numerator is (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x). Let's see. sin 2x is 2 sin x cos x, so 1/2 sin 2x is sin x cos x. Then the numerator becomes sin x cos x + cos 2x.So A = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] / [ (cos x - sin x)/cos x ] = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)].Let's factor the numerator here. sin x cos x + cos 2x. Maybe we can factor cos x out? Hmm, cos 2x is cos²x - sin²x. Let's see:sin x cos x + cos 2x = sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe write cos 2x as cos²x - sin²x and see if we can combine terms:sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x. Let's group terms:= cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x. Hmm. Maybe factor:Looking at cos²x - sin²x, which is cos 2x, and then adding sin x cos x. Not obvious. Alternatively, factor cos x from the first two terms:cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x. Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, let's rearrange:= cos²x - sin²x + sin x cos x = cos 2x + (1/2) sin 2x. Wait, that's the original numerator. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps factor differently. Let me think. If we have cos x - sin x in the denominator, maybe the numerator can be expressed in terms of (cos x - sin x) or (cos x + sin x). Let's see.Suppose we consider the numerator: sin x cos x + cos 2x. Let's express cos 2x as (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x). Wait, cos 2x = cos²x - sin²x = (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x). Therefore:sin x cos x + (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x).So the numerator is sin x cos x + (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x). Let's factor (cos x + sin x) from the two terms? Wait:sin x cos x + (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) = sin x cos x + (cos²x - sin²x). Which is just going back to the original. Maybe not helpful.Alternatively, let's factor (cos x - sin x) out of the numerator. Let's see:If we have sin x cos x + cos 2x = sin x cos x + (cos²x - sin²x). Let's try to write this as:cos²x - sin²x + sin x cos x = cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x. Not sure. Alternatively:= cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin x (sin x). Hmm. Maybe not. Alternatively, notice that sin x cos x = (sin x cos x) and cos²x - sin²x = (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x). Not sure.Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of sin x and cos x:Numerator: sin x cos x + cos 2x = sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x.Denominator: (cos x - sin x)/cos x.So A = [sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x] * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)].Let me factor numerator:sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x. Let's arrange terms:cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x. Hmm. Let me see if this can be factored.Looking at cos²x - sin²x, that's (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x). Then we have + sin x cos x. So:(cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) + sin x cos x.Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, group cos²x + sin x cos x = cos x (cos x + sin x). Then subtract sin²x. So:cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x. Still not obvious.Alternatively, perhaps factor (cos x + sin x) from some terms:cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x = cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin x * sin x.Not helpful. Maybe try to factor:Wait, the numerator is cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x. Let me rearrange:= (cos²x - sin²x) + sin x cos x = cos 2x + sin x cos x. Which is the original expression. Hmm. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe express the numerator as a multiple of the denominator. Since the denominator is (cos x - sin x)/cos x, which is (cos x - sin x) over cos x. The numerator is [something] multiplied by cos x. Wait, maybe we can factor (cos x - sin x) from the numerator.Wait, let me think. Let's suppose we have the numerator:sin x cos x + cos 2x = sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x = cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x.Let me write this as (cos x - sin x)(something). Let's try to factor:Suppose (cos x - sin x)(A) = cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x. Let's see:(cos x - sin x)(A) = cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x.Let me expand the left side: (cos x - sin x)(A). Let's let A = a cos x + b sin x, maybe? Or perhaps a constant? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is (cos x + sin x) + something. Let's see:If we take (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) = cos²x - sin²x. Which is part of our numerator. Then the numerator is cos²x - sin²x + sin x cos x = (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) + sin x cos x.Hmm, but how does that help? Maybe not. Alternatively, note that (cos x - sin x) is in the denominator, so if the numerator can be written as (cos x - sin x) times something, then they would cancel. Let's try.Let me see:cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x. Let's group cos²x - sin²x and then sin x cos x:= (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) + sin x cos x. So, as before. Then the numerator is (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) + sin x cos x. So when we divide by (cos x - sin x)/cos x, we get:[ (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) + sin x cos x ] * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)].This can be split into two terms:First term: (cos x - sin x)(cos x + sin x) * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)] = (cos x + sin x) * cos x.Second term: sin x cos x * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)] = sin x cos²x / (cos x - sin x).So overall, A = (cos x + sin x) cos x + [sin x cos²x / (cos x - sin x)].Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let me check if there's another way.Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let t = tan x. Then, since tan x = -3/4, perhaps we can express sin 2x and cos 2x in terms of t.But maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me check the original approach again. The initial substitution gave A = -4/35. Let's verify if that makes sense.Given cos x = -4/5, sin x = 3/5. So x is in the second quadrant. Then 2x would be in the third or fourth quadrant? Let's see. If x is between π/2 and π, then 2x is between π and 2π. So 2x is in the third or fourth quadrant. Let's see, for example, if x is 120 degrees (2π/3), then 2x is 240 degrees (4π/3), which is in the third quadrant. So sin 2x would be negative, which matches our calculation of sin 2x = -24/25. Cos 2x is 7/25. Since 2x is in the third quadrant, cos 2x should be negative? Wait, but we calculated cos 2x as 7/25, which is positive. Wait, that's a problem. If x is in the second quadrant, say x = 120 degrees, then 2x = 240 degrees, which is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. But according to our calculation, cos 2x is 7/25. That's positive. That seems contradictory. So there must be a mistake here.Wait, this is a critical point. If x is in the second quadrant, then 2x is in the third or fourth. Let's check. For example, if x is π/2 < x < π, then 2x is π < 2x < 2π. So depending on where x is, 2x could be in the third or fourth. If x is in (π/2, 3π/4), then 2x is in (π, 3π/2), third quadrant. If x is in (3π/4, π), then 2x is in (3π/2, 2π), fourth quadrant. So cos 2x would be negative in third quadrant and positive in fourth. Wait, so depending on x, cos 2x can be positive or negative. But given that cos x = -4/5, let's compute x. cos x = -4/5, so x is in the second quadrant. Let's find the reference angle. The reference angle would be arccos(4/5). So x = π - arccos(4/5). Therefore, 2x = 2π - 2 arccos(4/5). The angle 2 arccos(4/5) would be in the first quadrant, so 2x is 2π minus that, so in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, cos 2x is positive, which matches our calculation of 7/25. So that's okay. Because 2x is in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. Therefore, cos 2x being positive is correct. So that wasn't a mistake. So cos 2x is positive 7/25. Then sin 2x is negative because in the fourth quadrant, sine is negative. Which matches our calculation of sin 2x = -24/25. Okay, that checks out. So proceeding with that, the numerator is -1/5 and denominator 7/4, leading to A = -4/35. Wait, but let me check the sign again. Because A is equal to [(-1/5)] / [7/4] = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35. So that's negative. Is that possible? Let's see. Since x is in the second quadrant. Let's see, cos x is negative, sin x is positive. tan x is negative. The numerator is (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x). sin 2x is negative, so 1/2 sin 2x is negative. cos 2x is positive. So the numerator is negative + positive. Which one is bigger? The numerator was -12/25 +7/25 = -5/25 = -1/5. So the numerator is negative. The denominator is 1 - tan x. Since tan x is -3/4, 1 - (-3/4) is 1 + 3/4 = 7/4, which is positive. Therefore, A is negative divided by positive, so negative. So A is -4/35, which is a negative number, which seems plausible.But let me check with another method. Let's compute x first. Given cos x = -4/5, so the reference angle is arccos(4/5). Then x = π - arccos(4/5). Let's compute 2x. 2x = 2π - 2 arccos(4/5). Then sin 2x = -sin(2 arccos(4/5)), cos 2x = cos(2 arccos(4/5)). Let's compute these.Let’s compute cos(2 arccos(4/5)). Let θ = arccos(4/5), so cos θ = 4/5. Then cos 2θ = 2 cos²θ -1 = 2*(16/25) -1 =32/25 -1=7/25, which is the same as before. So cos 2x =7/25. Similarly, sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ =2*(3/5)*(4/5)=24/25. So sin 2x = sin(2θ) but since 2x =2π - 2θ, sin(2x) = sin(2π - 2θ) = -sin(2θ) = -24/25, which matches. So calculations are consistent. So A is -4/35. Let me confirm once more.Numerator: (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x) = (1/2*(-24/25) +7/25) = (-12/25 +7/25)= -5/25= -1/5.Denominator:1 - tan x=1 -(-3/4)=7/4.A= (-1/5)/(7/4)= (-1/5)*(4/7)= -4/35.Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be -4/35. But let's check if the problem says \\"Calculate the value of the expression A\\", so the answer is -4/35, which is exact.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a positive answer? Let me check once again. Maybe I messed up signs when computing sin x or cos x.Given cos x = -4/5, x in second quadrant, so sin x is positive 3/5. Correct.tan x = sin x / cos x = (3/5)/(-4/5)= -3/4. Correct.sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x =2*(3/5)*(-4/5)= -24/25. Correct.cos 2x =2 cos²x -1=2*(16/25)-1=7/25. Correct.Numerator:1/2 sin2x + cos2x= (-12/25 +7/25)= -5/25= -1/5. Correct.Denominator:1 - tanx=1 -(-3/4)=7/4. Correct.A= (-1/5)/(7/4)= -4/35. Correct.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{-dfrac{4}{35}}.Final Answerboxed{-dfrac{4}{35}}</think>Given the expression ( A = frac{frac{1}{2} sin 2x + cos 2x}{1 - tan x} ) and the conditions (cos x = -frac{4}{5}) and (frac{pi}{2} < x < pi), we need to calculate the value of (A).1. Find (sin x):   Since (cos x = -frac{4}{5}) and (x) is in the second quadrant, we use the Pythagorean identity:   [   sin x = sqrt{1 - cos^2 x} = sqrt{1 - left(-frac{4}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{16}{25}} = sqrt{frac{9}{25}} = frac{3}{5}   ]2. Find (tan x):   [   tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x} = frac{frac{3}{5}}{-frac{4}{5}} = -frac{3}{4}   ]3. Calculate (sin 2x) and (cos 2x):   - Using the double-angle identity for sine:     [     sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2 left(frac{3}{5}right) left(-frac{4}{5}right) = -frac{24}{25}     ]   - Using the double-angle identity for cosine:     [     cos 2x = 2 cos^2 x - 1 = 2 left(-frac{4}{5}right)^2 - 1 = 2 left(frac{16}{25}right) - 1 = frac{32}{25} - 1 = frac{7}{25}     ]4. Substitute into the numerator:   [   frac{1}{2} sin 2x + cos 2x = frac{1}{2} left(-frac{24}{25}right) + frac{7}{25} = -frac{12}{25} + frac{7}{25} = -frac{5}{25} = -frac{1}{5}   ]5. Calculate the denominator:   [   1 - tan x = 1 - left(-frac{3}{4}right) = 1 + frac{3}{4} = frac{7}{4}   ]6. Divide the numerator by the denominator:   [   A = frac{-frac{1}{5}}{frac{7}{4}} = -frac{1}{5} times frac{4}{7} = -frac{4}{35}   ]The value of the expression (A) is (boxed{-dfrac{4}{35}}).,<think>Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of the expression A given that cos x is -4/5 and x is between pi/2 and pi. So x is in the second quadrant. Alright, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities and see how to simplify the expression A.First, the expression is A = [ (1/2) sin 2x + cos 2x ] / [1 - tan x]. Hmm, let's break this down. The numerator has sin 2x and cos 2x, and the denominator is 1 - tan x. Since we know cos x, maybe we can find sin x and tan x first, then compute each part.Given cos x = -4/5 and x is in the second quadrant (pi/2 < x < pi). In the second quadrant, sin x is positive, and tan x is negative because tan x = sin x / cos x, and cos x is negative here. Let's find sin x first.Using the Pythagorean identity: sin²x + cos²x = 1. So sin²x = 1 - cos²x = 1 - (-4/5)² = 1 - 16/25 = 9/25. Therefore, sin x = 3/5 or -3/5, but since x is in the second quadrant, sin x is positive. So sin x = 3/5.Now, tan x = sin x / cos x = (3/5) / (-4/5) = -3/4. So tan x = -3/4. Let's note that down.Now, let's compute sin 2x and cos 2x. Remember that sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x and cos 2x can be expressed in different forms. Let's use cos 2x = cos²x - sin²x for this case. Alternatively, we can use 2cos²x - 1 or 1 - 2 sin²x. Let's see which one is easier.First, sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2*(3/5)*(-4/5) = 2*(-12/25) = -24/25.For cos 2x, let's compute using cos²x - sin²x: (-4/5)² - (3/5)² = 16/25 - 9/25 = 7/25. So cos 2x = 7/25.Alternatively, using 2cos²x - 1: 2*(16/25) - 1 = 32/25 - 25/25 = 7/25. Same result.So now the numerator is (1/2) sin 2x + cos 2x. Let's compute each term:(1/2) sin 2x = (1/2)*(-24/25) = -12/25.cos 2x = 7/25.Adding them together: -12/25 + 7/25 = (-12 + 7)/25 = -5/25 = -1/5.So the numerator is -1/5.Now the denominator is 1 - tan x. We found tan x = -3/4. Therefore, 1 - tan x = 1 - (-3/4) = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4.Therefore, the denominator is 7/4.So A = (-1/5) / (7/4) = (-1/5) * (4/7) = -4/35.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify step by step again to check for errors.First, sin x was found as 3/5. Correct, since in the second quadrant, sin is positive. Then tan x is -3/4. Correct. Then sin 2x = 2*(3/5)*(-4/5) = -24/25. Correct. Then cos 2x: 16/25 - 9/25 = 7/25. Correct.Then numerator: (1/2)*(-24/25) + 7/25 = -12/25 + 7/25 = -5/25 = -1/5. Correct.Denominator: 1 - (-3/4) = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4. Correct.So A = (-1/5) / (7/4) = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35. That's the answer.But wait, let me check if there's a way to simplify the original expression A before substituting values. Maybe using identities?Original expression: A = [ (1/2 sin 2x + cos 2x ) ] / [1 - tan x].Let me see if the numerator can be rewritten. 1/2 sin 2x is sin x cos x (since sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x, so 1/2 sin 2x = sin x cos x). So numerator becomes sin x cos x + cos 2x.So A = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] / [1 - tan x].Hmm, perhaps factor something? Let's see.Alternatively, express everything in terms of sin x and cos x. Let's try that.First, numerator: sin x cos x + cos 2x.Denominator: 1 - (sin x / cos x).So denominator is [cos x - sin x] / cos x.Therefore, A = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)].Let me compute the numerator first:sin x cos x + cos 2x. Let's see if we can factor this.Alternatively, note that cos 2x = cos²x - sin²x. So the numerator is sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x. Maybe factor terms.Let me rearrange terms:= cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x.Hmm, maybe group terms:= cos²x - sin²x + sin x cos x.But cos²x - sin²x is cos 2x, but that's going back. Not helpful. Alternatively, factor:Take cos x common in first two terms: cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x.Not sure. Alternatively, let's think of the numerator as:cos x (sin x + cos x) - sin²x. Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, let's think of the numerator and denominator together.A = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] * [cos x / (cos x - sin x)].Let me substitute cos 2x with 2cos²x - 1. Then numerator becomes:sin x cos x + 2cos²x - 1.But perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, substitute cos 2x = cos²x - sin²x.So numerator is sin x cos x + cos²x - sin²x.Wait, can we factor this?Let me write it as cos²x + sin x cos x - sin²x.Hmm, perhaps factor as (cos x + sin x)(cos x) - sin²x. Not sure.Alternatively, perhaps factor as cos x (cos x + sin x) - sin²x. Not sure.Alternatively, let's write everything in terms of sin x and cos x and see if we can factor.Alternatively, let's factor numerator and denominator.Denominator is (cos x - sin x)/cos x. So the expression A becomes:Numerator * cos x / (cos x - sin x) = [sin x cos x + cos 2x] * cos x / (cos x - sin x).Alternatively, factor cos x in the numerator:= cos x (sin x + cos 2x / cos x) * 1/(cos x - sin x). Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let's try to substitute the values we have.Wait, but since we already calculated the value as -4/35, maybe there is no need. However, perhaps there is a different approach.Alternatively, maybe rationalize the denominator or use common denominators.Wait, but given that the calculation gave me -4/35, and all steps seem correct, perhaps that is the answer. Let me check once again.Given cos x = -4/5, sin x = 3/5, so sin 2x = 2*(3/5)*(-4/5) = -24/25. Correct.cos 2x = (-4/5)^2 - (3/5)^2 = 16/25 - 9/25 = 7/25. Correct.So numerator is (1/2)*(-24/25) + 7/25 = -12/25 + 7/25 = -5/25 = -1/5. Correct.Denominator is 1 - (-3/4) = 7/4. Correct.So A = (-1/5)/(7/4) = (-1/5)*(4/7) = -4/35. Yes, that seems right.But let me check if there's a sign error. Since x is in the second quadrant, tan x is negative, so 1 - tan x is 1 - (-3/4) = 7/4. Correct.All steps seem correct. Therefore, the value of A is -4/35.Final AnswerThe value of the expression ( A ) is boxed{-dfrac{4}{35}}.</think>Given the expression ( A = frac{frac{1}{2} sin 2x + cos 2x}{1 - tan x} ) and the conditions (cos x = -frac{4}{5}) and (frac{pi}{2} < x < pi), we need to find the exact value of ( A ).1.

B.It is easy to know that there are only two three-digit numbers: 124, 412.","generations":"[<think>Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. The question is about forming a two-digit number using the digits 1, 2, and 4, each exactly once. Then we need to find out how many of these two-digit numbers are multiples of 4. The options given are from A to D, with possible answers 1 to 4. Let me think through this carefully.First, let's understand the problem. We have three digits: 1, 2, and 4. We need to form two-digit numbers using each digit only once. Wait, hold on. The problem says \\"form a two-digit number once each.\\" Hmm. That might mean that each digit is used once in forming the number. But since it's a two-digit number, we can only use two digits out of the three. Wait, this might be a translation issue because the original problem is in Chinese. Let me parse the question again.Original problem: \\"H 1,2,4 are used to form a two-digit number once each. Then the two-digit number that is a multiple of 4 is ( ) in total. (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4\\"So maybe the translation is slightly off. It might mean that each of the digits 1, 2, 4 is used exactly once when forming the two-digit number. But that's impossible because a two-digit number can only have two digits. Therefore, perhaps the intended meaning is that we can use each digit at most once when forming the number. So, we have digits 1, 2, 4, and we can use each digit only once when forming the two-digit number. Therefore, we need to pick two different digits from 1, 2, 4 to form the number, and then check if that number is a multiple of 4.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese where \\"once each\\" refers to forming numbers where each digit is used exactly once, but since it's a two-digit number, maybe it's part of a set of numbers? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.If we have digits 1, 2, 4, and we need to form two-digit numbers using each digit once each. If we have to form a two-digit number, then we can only use two digits. Therefore, maybe the problem is saying that each digit is used once in the process, but since it's a two-digit number, each number is formed by two unique digits from the set {1, 2, 4}, and each digit is used exactly once across all numbers? But that interpretation is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is translated as \\"using each digit once\\" when forming each number. So each two-digit number must consist of distinct digits from 1, 2, 4. That is, digits cannot be repeated in a number. So, for example, 11 is not allowed because 1 is repeated. But since all digits given are unique (1, 2, 4), the possible two-digit numbers are permutations of two different digits from the three. So total possible numbers are 3P2 = 3*2 = 6 numbers. Let's list them:Possible two-digit numbers using 1, 2, 4 without repetition:12, 14, 21, 24, 41, 42.So these are all the possible two-digit numbers. Now, among these six numbers, we need to find how many are multiples of 4.A number is a multiple of 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. But since these are two-digit numbers themselves, the entire number must be divisible by 4.So let's check each of these numbers:1. 12: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. So yes, 12 is a multiple of 4.2. 14: 14 ÷ 4 = 3.5. Not an integer, so no.3. 21: 21 ÷ 4 = 5.25. Not an integer.4. 24: 24 ÷ 4 = 6. Yes, multiple of 4.5. 41: 41 ÷ 4 = 10.25. No.6. 42: 42 ÷ 4 = 10.5. No.So, from the list, 12 and 24 are multiples of 4. That gives us two numbers. Therefore, the total is 2, which corresponds to option B.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers or miscalculate. Let's verify again:12: yes, 4×3=12.14: 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. Not a whole number.21: 21 divided by 4 is 5.25. Not whole.24: 4×6=24. Yes.41: 41 divided by 4 is 10.25. Not.42: 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. No.So only two numbers: 12 and 24. Therefore, the answer should be B) 2.But just to make sure, let me recall the rule for divisibility by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Since these are two-digit numbers, the entire number must be divisible by 4.Alternatively, for a two-digit number, it's divisible by 4 if the tens digit multiplied by 10 plus the units digit is divisible by 4. Which is the same as the number itself. So yeah, same as before.So, 12: 12 is divisible by 4. 24: 24 is divisible by 4. The others aren't. So total two numbers. Therefore, the answer is B.But hold on, let me check once again the problem statement. It says \\"the two-digit number that is a multiple of 4 is ( ) in total.\\" So the answer is the number of such two-digit numbers. Wait, the way it's phrased is a bit odd. \\"The two-digit number that is a multiple of 4 is ( ) in total.\\" So maybe it's asking for how many such numbers exist. So from the list, as we found, two numbers: 12 and 24. So the answer is 2, which is option B. Therefore, I think the correct answer is B.Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem. For example, if the digits 1, 2, 4 are used to form a two-digit number, each digit once. Wait, but in Chinese, sometimes problems can have nuances. If it's translated as \\"using each digit once,\\" but if forming a single two-digit number, you have to use each digit once. But that would be impossible, since two digits are needed. So perhaps the problem is mistranslated, and actually refers to forming two-digit numbers where each digit is used exactly once in the entire set of numbers? But that would be more complicated. But given the answer choices are 1 to 4, and we have two valid numbers, 12 and 24, I think the answer is 2. So option B.Yes, I think that's the correct approach. The key is to list all possible two-digit numbers formed by 1, 2, 4 without repetition and check which are divisible by 4. That gives two numbers. Therefore, the answer is B) 2.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>To solve the problem of finding how many two-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 4 (each used exactly once) that are multiples of 4, we first list all possible two-digit numbers formed by these digits without repetition. The possible numbers are:12, 14, 21, 24, 41, 42.Next, we check which of these numbers are divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the entire number is a multiple of 4. - 12 ÷ 4 = 3 (divisible by 4)- 14 ÷ 4 = 3.5 (not divisible by 4)- 21 ÷ 4 = 5.25 (not divisible by 4)- 24 ÷ 4 = 6 (divisible by 4)- 41 ÷ 4 = 10.25 (not divisible by 4)- 42 ÷ 4 = 10.5 (not divisible by 4)The numbers 12 and 24 are multiples of 4. Therefore, there are two such numbers.The answer is (boxed{B}).,<think>Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have the digits 1, 2, and 4, and we need to form two-digit numbers using each digit once. Then, we have to count how many of those numbers are multiples of 4. The options given are from A to D, with D being 4. Hmm, okay.First, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. We need to form two-digit numbers, each digit must be unique, and we can only use 1, 2, and 4. Wait, but hold on, a two-digit number requires two digits, right? So if we have three digits (1, 2, 4) but we need to form a two-digit number using each digit once. Wait, that might be confusing. If we have to use each digit once, but a two-digit number only has two digits. Maybe the problem means that each digit can be used once in the entire number, which is two digits. So, each digit is used once per number, but since the number is two digits, we can only use two different digits each time. But the problem says \\"1,2,4 are used to form a two-digit number once each.\\" Hmm, maybe the translation is a bit off. Maybe it's saying that each digit is used once in forming the two-digit numbers. So, perhaps all the possible two-digit numbers formed by using each of the digits 1, 2, 4 exactly once. But since two-digit numbers require two digits, maybe we have to pick two different digits from 1, 2, 4 each time, and form a number, then check if it's a multiple of 4. Then, count how many such numbers there are.Okay, so first, let's list all possible two-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 4 without repeating any digit. So, the possible two-digit numbers are:12, 14, 21, 24, 41, 42.Wait, that's all? Let's see. The digits available are 1, 2, 4. For the tens place, we can have 1, 2, or 4. For each choice of tens digit, the units digit can be any of the remaining two digits. So:If tens digit is 1: units can be 2 or 4 → 12, 14If tens digit is 2: units can be 1 or 4 → 21, 24If tens digit is 4: units can be 1 or 2 → 41, 42So total of 6 numbers. Got it. Now, we need to check which of these numbers are multiples of 4.A number is a multiple of 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. But since these are all two-digit numbers, the entire number needs to be divisible by 4. So, let's check each number:12: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. So yes, 12 is a multiple of 4.14: 14 ÷ 4 = 3.5. Not a whole number, so not a multiple of 4.21: 21 ÷ 4 = 5.25. Not a whole number, so no.24: 24 ÷ 4 = 6. Yes, 24 is a multiple of 4.41: 41 ÷ 4 = 10.25. No.42: 42 ÷ 4 = 10.5. No.So, out of the six numbers, only 12 and 24 are multiples of 4. That's two numbers. Therefore, the answer should be B) 2.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any numbers. The possible numbers are 12, 14, 21, 24, 41, 42. Checked each one: 12 and 24 are multiples of 4. The rest aren't. So that's two. Therefore, the answer is B. I think that's correct.But hold on, the options given are (A) 1, (B) 2, (C) 3, (D) 4. So, two is an option. Yeah, seems correct. Maybe the confusion could be if the problem meant using all three digits to form a two-digit number, but that doesn't make sense. Because you can't use three digits in a two-digit number. So, I think the problem is just saying that the digits 1,2,4 are available, each can be used once in the number, meaning each digit can be used once per number. Since the number is two-digit, each number uses two distinct digits from the set {1,2,4}, no repetition. So, yeah, 6 numbers, two of which are multiples of 4. So the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>To determine how many two-digit numbers formed using the digits 1, 2, and 4 (each used once) are multiples of 4, we first list all possible two-digit numbers:- Tens digit 1: 12, 14- Tens digit 2: 21, 24- Tens digit 4: 41, 42This gives us the numbers: 12, 14, 21, 24, 41, 42.Next, we check which of these numbers are multiples of 4:- 12 ÷ 4 = 3 (multiple of 4)- 14 ÷ 4 = 3.5 (not a multiple of 4)- 21 ÷ 4 = 5.25 (not a multiple of 4)- 24 ÷ 4 = 6 (multiple of 4)- 41 ÷ 4 = 10.25 (not a multiple of 4)- 42 ÷ 4 = 10.5 (not a multiple of 4)The numbers 12 and 24 are multiples of 4. Therefore, there are 2 such numbers.boxed{B}]"},{"problem":"Among the following functions, which is both an even function and has the smallest positive period of pi?

This question mainly examines the periodicity of trigonometric functions and their methods of determination, as well as the odd-even properties of trigonometric functions, and is considered a medium-level question.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out which of the given functions is both even and has the smallest positive period of π. The options are A: y=sin2x, B: y=cosx, C: y=tanx, D: y=|tanx|. Let me start by recalling what even functions are and then check the periods of each function.First, even functions. An even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, I need to check each of these functions to see if they meet that criterion. Let me go through each one.Starting with option A: y = sin2x. The sine function is generally an odd function because sin(-x) = -sinx. But here, the argument is 2x. Let's compute f(-x) for this function. f(-x) = sin(2*(-x)) = sin(-2x) = -sin(2x). So that's -f(x). Therefore, this function is odd, not even. So A is out because it's not even.Moving to option B: y = cosx. Cosine is a standard even function. Let's verify: cos(-x) = cosx. Yep, that's even. Now, what's the period of cosx? The standard period for cosine is 2π. So the period here is 2π. But the question is asking for the smallest positive period of π. Since 2π is larger than π, B doesn't satisfy the period condition. So B is even, but period is too big. So maybe not B.Option C: y = tanx. Tangent function. Let's check if it's even. tan(-x) = -tanx. So that's -f(x), which makes it odd, not even. So C is out.Option D: y = |tanx|. Absolute value of tangent. Let's check if it's even. f(-x) = |tan(-x)| = | -tanx | = |tanx| = f(x). So yes, D is even. Now, what's the period of |tanx|? The regular tanx has a period of π. But when you take the absolute value, does the period change? Let me think. The tanx function repeats every π, but since we're taking the absolute value, which makes the negative parts positive, so the graph of |tanx| would repeat every π/2? Wait, no. Let me visualize. The regular tanx has vertical asymptotes at -π/2, π/2, 3π/2, etc., and it's increasing from -∞ to ∞ between each pair of asymptotes. Taking the absolute value would reflect the negative parts to positive, so between -π/2 and 0, it becomes positive. But then between 0 and π/2, it's already positive. So the graph from 0 to π/2 is the same as from -π/2 to 0 when you take absolute value. But does the period become π/2?Wait, let me test with specific values. Let's compute |tan(x + π/2)|. If the period were π/2, then |tan(x + π/2)| should equal |tanx|. Let's pick x = 0. |tan(0 + π/2)| = |tan(π/2)|, but tan(π/2) is undefined. Hmm, maybe not the best point. Let's take x = π/4. Then |tan(π/4 + π/2)| = |tan(3π/4)| = | -1 | = 1. And |tan(π/4)| = 1. So that's the same. What about x = π/6. |tan(π/6 + π/2)| = |tan(2π/3)| = | -√3 | = √3. |tan(π/6)| = 1/√3. Not the same. Wait, that's different. So if I add π/2 to x, the value changes. So maybe the period isn't π/2. Then what is the period?Original tanx has period π. When we take absolute value of tanx, does the period stay π or become something else?Let's check if the function repeats every π. Let's take |tan(x + π)|. tan(x + π) = tanx, since tan has period π. So |tan(x + π)| = |tanx|. Therefore, the period is at most π. Is there a smaller period? Suppose there is a period T < π such that |tan(x + T)| = |tanx| for all x. Let's test T = π/2. Take x = 0. Then |tan(0 + π/2)| = undefined (asymptote), which is not helpful. Take x = π/4. |tan(π/4 + π/2)| = |tan(3π/4)| = |-1| = 1. |tan(π/4)| = 1. That's the same. Take x = π/6. |tan(π/6 + π/2)| = |tan(2π/3)| = |-√3| = √3. |tan(π/6)| = 1/√3. Not equal. So adding π/2 doesn't preserve the value. Therefore, π/2 is not a period. How about T = π? Then we already saw that |tan(x + π)| = |tanx + tanπ/(1 - tanx tanπ)|? Wait, no. Wait, tan(x + π) = tanx because tan has period π. So |tan(x + π)| = |tanx|. So period is π. Therefore, the period of |tanx| is π. So D has period π.Therefore, D is an even function and has period π. So that would satisfy the conditions.Wait, let's just confirm the other options again. A is odd, period π/2? Wait, original sine function has period 2π. If we have y = sin2x, the period is π, because the coefficient B in sin(Bx) is 2, so period is 2π/B = π. But since it's an odd function, we can eliminate A. B is even, but period 2π. C is odd, period π. D is even, period π. So D is the answer.But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake with the period of |tanx|. Suppose we have |tanx|. Let's check if the period is π. Let's take a value, say x = π/4. |tan(π/4)| = 1. Then x = π/4 + π = 5π/4. |tan(5π/4)| = |1| = 1. So that's the same. Similarly, x = π/6: |tan(π/6)| = 1/√3, x = π/6 + π = 7π/6: |tan(7π/6)| = |1/√3|. So that works. But if we take x = 0, |tan(0)| = 0, and |tan(0 + π)| = |tanπ| = 0. So that's the same. So yes, the period is π. Therefore, D has period π and is even.So the answer should be D.Final Answerboxed{D}</think>To determine which function is both even and has the smallest positive period of (pi), we analyze each option:- Option A: (y = sin 2x)  - This function is odd because (sin(-2x) = -sin 2x).  - Period: (pi) (since the period of (sin Bx) is (frac{2pi}{B}), here (B = 2)).  - Not an even function.- Option B: (y = cos x)  - This function is even because (cos(-x) = cos x).  - Period: (2pi).  - Period is too long.- Option C: (y = tan x)  - This function is odd because (tan(-x) = -tan x).  - Period: (pi).  - Not an even function.- Option D: (y = |tan x|)  - This function is even because (|tan(-x)| = |-tan x| = |tan x|).  - Period: (pi) (since (tan x) has a period of (pi), and taking the absolute value does not change the period).Thus, the function that is both even and has the smallest positive period of (pi) is (boxed{D}).,<think>Okay, so I need to figure out which of these functions is both even and has the smallest positive period of π. Let's take it step by step. First, let me remember what an even function is. An even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, I need to check each of the given functions to see if they are even. Then, for the ones that are even, I have to determine their periods and see which one has the smallest positive period of π.Let's go through each option one by one.Option A: y = sin 2x. Hmm, first, is this function even? Let's test it. The sine function is odd, meaning sin(-x) = -sin x. So, sin(2*(-x)) = sin(-2x) = -sin 2x. That's equal to -y, so y = sin 2x is an odd function, not even. Therefore, option A is out.Option B: y = cos x. Alright, cosine is a classic even function because cos(-x) = cos x. So, this is even. Now, what's its period? The standard cosine function has a period of 2π. Unless there's a transformation that affects the period. The function here is just cos x, no horizontal compression or stretching. So, the period is 2π. But the question asks for the smallest positive period of π. So, 2π is larger than π, so this might not be the answer. Let me check the other options first.Option C: y = tan x. Tangent function. Is tan x even? Let's see. tan(-x) = -tan x, which makes it an odd function. So, not even. So, option C is out.Option D: y = |tan x|. Absolute value of tan x. Let's check if this is even. |tan(-x)| = | -tan x | = |tan x|. So, yes, because the absolute value negates the negative sign, making it even. So, this function is even. Now, what's its period?The standard tan x function has a period of π. But when we take the absolute value of tan x, does the period change? Let's think. The absolute value would reflect any negative parts of tan x to positive, effectively mirroring the graph in the positive y-axis. However, since tan x already has a period of π, taking the absolute value might make the period π/2? Wait, let me verify.Take a value x where tan x is positive, say between 0 and π/2. Then, between π/2 and π, tan x is negative, but |tan x| would be positive. Then, from π to 3π/2, tan x is positive again (since tan has period π), but wait, actually tan x is positive from 0 to π/2, negative from π/2 to π, positive from π to 3π/2, etc. But with absolute value, |tan x| is positive from 0 to π/2, positive from π/2 to π (since absolute value), then from π to 3π/2, it's the same as from 0 to π/2 again. Wait, but is the period π or π/2?Wait, let's test specific values. Let's take x = 0. |tan 0| = 0. Then x = π/4: |tan π/4| = 1. x = π/2: undefined. Then x = π: |tan π| = 0. x = 3π/4: |tan 3π/4| = | -1 | = 1. x = π/2: undefined. So, between 0 and π, the function goes from 0 up to infinity at π/2, then back to 0 at π. Then from π to 2π, it does the same thing again. Wait, but if we look at the graph of |tan x|, it's actually repeating every π. Because tan(x + π) = tan x, so |tan(x + π)| = |tan x|. Therefore, the period is π. So, the period remains π even after taking the absolute value. So, the period of |tan x| is π. So, the smallest positive period is π.So, option D is even and has period π. Option B is even but has period 2π. So, the answer should be D.But let me double-check. Let's confirm the period of |tan x|. Let's take a point x, then check if |tan(x + T)| = |tan x|. For T = π/2. Let's see. If we take x = 0, then |tan(0 + π/2)| is undefined, but |tan(0 + π)| = |tan π| = 0, which is the same as |tan 0|. If we take x = π/4, |tan(π/4 + π)| = |tan(5π/4)| = |1| = 1, which is same as |tan π/4|. So, adding π to x gives the same value. If we add π/2, it's undefined. So, the period can't be π/2. So, the period is π. Therefore, the smallest period is π.Therefore, among the options, D is the one that is both even and has period π. So, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}</think>To determine which function is both even and has the smallest positive period of (pi), we analyze each option:- Option A: (y = sin 2x)    The sine function is odd, so (sin(-2x) = -sin 2x).

I need to find the value of 1/r + 1/h given that the volume of the cylinder is 1 and the surface area is 12. The options are A) 2, B) 3, C) 6, D) 12. Hmm. Let me recall the formulas for the volume and surface area of a cylinder.The volume of a cylinder is πr²h, right? And the surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. Wait, no, hold on. The surface area includes the two circular bases and the lateral surface. So, surface area should be 2πr² (for the two circles) plus 2πrh (the lateral part). Yeah, that's correct.Given that volume is 1, so πr²h = 1. And the surface area is 12, so 2πr² + 2πrh = 12. We need to find 1/r + 1/h. Let me write down the equations:1. πr²h = 12. 2πr² + 2πrh = 12Let me see. Maybe I can express h from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let's try that.From equation 1: πr²h = 1 => h = 1/(πr²)Substitute h into equation 2:2πr² + 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 12Simplify the second term:2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 2*(1/r) = 2/rSo the equation becomes:2πr² + 2/r = 12Hmm. So we have 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Let me divide both sides by 2:πr² + 1/r = 6Wait, so πr² + 1/r = 6. But from equation 1, πr²h = 1. Let me see if I can relate these two.From equation 1: πr² = 1/h. So substitute πr² into the modified surface area equation:1/h + 1/r = 6Wait, that's exactly what we need! Because 1/h + 1/r = 6. So then 1/r + 1/h = 6. But the answer choices are 2, 3, 6, 12. So is the answer C) 6?Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from surface area: 2πr² + 2πrh = 12. Divided by 2π: r² + rh = 6/π. Hmm, but that's a different approach. Wait, maybe I should check my substitution again.Original substitution: h = 1/(πr²). Then substitute into surface area equation:2πr² + 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 12Simplify the second term: 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 2*(1/r). So indeed, 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Divide by 2: πr² + 1/r = 6. From volume: πr²h = 1 => πr² = 1/h. Substitute into the equation:1/h + 1/r = 6. So 1/r + 1/h = 6. Therefore, the answer is C) 6.Wait, but the answer options include 6 as option C, so that's the answer. But let me double-check with another approach to be safe.Alternatively, let's let x = 1/r and y = 1/h. Then we need to find x + y.Given that volume: πr²h = 1. Let's express r and h in terms of x and y. Since x = 1/r => r = 1/x, and y = 1/h => h = 1/y.Substitute into the volume formula:π*(1/x)²*(1/y) = 1 => π/(x² y) = 1 => x² y = πSurface area: 2πr² + 2πrh = 12 => 2π*(1/x²) + 2π*(1/x)*(1/y) = 12 => 2π/x² + 2π/(x y) = 12Divide both sides by 2π:1/x² + 1/(x y) = 6/πBut from the volume equation, x² y = π => y = π/(x²)Substitute into the surface area equation:1/x² + 1/(x*(π/(x²))) = 6/πSimplify the second term: 1/(x*(π/(x²))) = 1/(π/x) = x/πSo equation becomes:1/x² + x/π = 6/πMultiply both sides by π:π/x² + x = 6Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't as straightforward. Let me check if this aligns with previous result.From previous result, x + y = 6, where x = 1/r and y = 1/h. Wait, no, earlier we had πr² + 1/r = 6, but after substituting h from volume equation, we found that 1/h + 1/r = 6. Wait, that seems contradictory to this approach.Wait, maybe I messed up in the substitution. Let's see. When we substituted h = 1/(πr²) into the surface area equation, we got 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Dividing by 2 gives πr² + 1/r = 6. Then, since πr² = 1/h from the volume equation, substituting gives 1/h + 1/r = 6. Therefore, x + y = 6 where x = 1/r and y = 1/h. Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 6. So that is correct. So answer is C) 6.But in the second approach, when I tried to represent in terms of x and y, I ended up with π/x² + x = 6, which is different. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check.Starting again:Volume equation in terms of x and y: π/(x² y) = 1 => x² y = π. So y = π/(x²).Surface area equation: 2π/(x²) + 2π/(x y) = 12.Divide by 2π: 1/x² + 1/(x y) = 6/π.Substitute y = π/(x²):1/x² + 1/(x*(π/(x²))) = 6/πSimplify the second term:1/(x*(π/x²)) = 1/(π/x) = x/πTherefore, equation becomes:1/x² + x/π = 6/πMultiply both sides by π:π/x² + x = 6But from the volume equation, x² y = π, and since y = π/x², then substituting y gives x²*(π/x²) = π, which checks out. So that's correct. So we have the equation π/x² + x = 6. Hmm. But how does this help us?Wait, we need to find x + y, where y = π/x². So x + y = x + π/x². The equation we have is π/x² + x = 6. So x + π/x² = 6. Therefore, x + y = 6. Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 6. So yes, this confirms the previous result.Therefore, answer is C) 6. So that must be correct.Alternatively, let me plug in some numbers. Suppose 1/r + 1/h = 6. Let's see if we can find r and h that satisfy the volume and surface area conditions.Suppose 1/r + 1/h = 6. Let's assume r = h. Then 2/r = 6 => r = 1/3. Then h = 1/3. Then volume would be π*(1/3)^2*(1/3) = π/27, which is not 1. So that's not possible. So maybe r and h are different.Alternatively, maybe take another approach. Let me denote S = 12, V = 1.Volume: V = πr²h = 1Surface area: S = 2πr² + 2πrh = 12We can divide surface area by volume to eliminate π:S/V = (2πr² + 2πrh)/πr²h = (2r² + 2rh)/r²h = 2(r + h)/r h = 2(1/h + 1/r) = S/VGiven S = 12, V = 1, so S/V = 12/1 = 12. Therefore, 2(1/h + 1/r) = 12 => (1/h + 1/r) = 6. So there we go. So that's another way. Therefore, answer is 6. Option C.Oh, that's a neat approach. Dividing surface area by volume gives 12, which is 2*(1/r +1/h). So 2*(1/r +1/h)=12 implies 1/r +1/h=6. That's much quicker. I should have thought of that.So yes, the answer is 6, which is option C.Final Answerboxed{C}</think>Given the radius ( r ) and height ( h ) of a cylinder, we know the volume is 1 and the surface area is 12.

The problem is about a cylinder with radius r and height h. The volume is 1, and the surface area is 12. We need to find 1/r + 1/h. The options are 2, 3, 6, 12. Hmm, let's start by recalling the formulas for the volume and surface area of a cylinder.Volume of a cylinder is πr²h, right? And the surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. Wait, actually, surface area is the area of the two circles on top and bottom plus the area of the side, which if you unroll it, it's a rectangle with height h and width equal to the circumference of the base, which is 2πr. So yeah, surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh.So given that volume is 1, we have πr²h = 1. And surface area is 12, so 2πr² + 2πrh = 12. Our goal is to find 1/r + 1/h. Let me write down the equations:1. πr²h = 12. 2πr² + 2πrh = 12We need to solve for r and h, then compute 1/r + 1/h. Maybe we can express h from the first equation and substitute into the second one.From the first equation: πr²h = 1 ⇒ h = 1/(πr²)Then substitute h into the second equation:2πr² + 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 12Simplify the second term:2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 2πr/(πr²) = 2/rSo the equation becomes:2πr² + 2/r = 12Hmm, so 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Let's divide both sides by 2 to simplify:πr² + 1/r = 6So πr² + 1/r = 6. Hmm. That's a nonlinear equation in terms of r. It might be tricky to solve algebraically. Maybe we can let’s see if we can express this in terms of 1/r or something. Alternatively, perhaps we can relate this to 1/r + 1/h. Let's see.From the first equation, h = 1/(πr²). So 1/h = πr². Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 1/r + πr². Wait, but according to the equation we derived earlier, πr² + 1/r = 6. So 1/r + πr² = 6. Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 6. Wait, but 1/h is πr², so 1/r + πr² = 6. Therefore, the answer is 6? That's option C. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Wait, let's step back. We had:From the volume equation: h = 1/(πr²). Therefore, 1/h = πr². Then 1/r + 1/h = 1/r + πr². Then from the surface area equation, we had πr² + 1/r = 6. So substituting that in, 1/r + πr² = 6, which is exactly 1/r + 1/h = 6. Therefore, the answer is 6, which is option C. That seems straightforward. But let me verify the steps again.Starting with the volume: V = πr²h = 1. So h = 1/(πr²). Then surface area: S = 2πr² + 2πrh = 12. Substitute h: 2πr² + 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 12. Simplify the second term: 2πr/(πr²) = 2/r. So 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Divide by 2: πr² + 1/r = 6. Then notice that πr² is 1/h, so πr² = 1/h. Therefore, 1/h + 1/r = 6. Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 6, which is answer C.Wait, that seems right, but let me check if there's an alternative way. Suppose we didn't notice that substitution. Maybe we can let x = 1/r and y = 1/h. Then 1/r + 1/h = x + y. Let's see if we can express the equations in terms of x and y.Given that h = 1/(πr²), so y = 1/h = πr². So y = πr². Also, x = 1/r. So r = 1/x, so y = π*(1/x)² = π/x². So y = π/x². Then, from the surface area equation, πr² + 1/r = 6. That's y + x = 6. So x + y = 6, which is exactly the quantity we need. Therefore, x + y = 6, so 1/r + 1/h = 6. So yes, the answer is 6. Therefore, option C. That seems consistent.Alternatively, suppose we didn't make that substitution. Maybe trying to solve for r numerically? Let's see. Let's suppose we can solve πr² + 1/r = 6. Let's see if that's feasible.But this equation might be difficult to solve algebraically. Let's check if possible. Multiply through by r: πr³ + 1 = 6r. So πr³ - 6r + 1 = 0. That's a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations is possible, but messy. But perhaps we can check if there are any rational roots. Let's see, by Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are factors of 1 over factors of π. But since π is irrational, probably no rational roots. So maybe this approach is not helpful. So perhaps the substitution approach is better.But since we already arrived at the answer through substitution, maybe that's sufficient. Let's just confirm once again. So Volume is πr²h = 1, so h = 1/(πr²). Surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh = 12. Substitute h: 2πr² + 2πr*(1/(πr²)) = 2πr² + 2/r = 12. Divide by 2: πr² + 1/r = 6. But h = 1/(πr²), so 1/h = πr². Therefore, πr² is 1/h, so 1/h + 1/r = 6. Therefore, 1/r + 1/h = 6. Therefore, the answer is C, 6.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So the answer is C.Final Answerboxed{C}</think>Given the radius ( r ) and height ( h ) of a cylinder, we know the volume is 1 and the surface area is 12.

This solution is derived by applying the sine formula for sum and difference of two angles and utilizing the transformation rules of the graph of the function y=Asin (omega x+varphi).  This question mainly examines the sine formula for sum and difference of two angles and the transformation rules of the graph of the function y=Asin (omega x+varphi), and is considered a basic question.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to figure out how much to shift the graph of y = 2 sin 2x to the left to get the graph of f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt(3) cos 2x. Hmm, this seems like a problem where I have to combine the sine and cosine terms into a single sine function with a phase shift. I remember something about the amplitude and phase shift from trigonometry. Let me think.First, the original function is f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt(3) cos 2x. The target is to write this in the form A sin(2x + φ), right? Because if I can write it like that, then it would be similar to 2 sin 2x shifted left by some amount. Wait, but the amplitude here might be different. Let me recall the formula.The formula for combining a sin θ + b cos θ into a single sine function is: A sin(θ + φ), where A = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ = arctan(b/a) or something like that. Let me check.Yes, actually, the identity is: a sin θ + b cos θ = A sin(θ + φ), where A = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ is the phase shift such that cos φ = a/A and sin φ = b/A. Alternatively, φ = arctan(b/a) if a ≠ 0. Let me verify that.Suppose we have a sin θ + b cos θ. Let's factor out A: A [ (a/A) sin θ + (b/A) cos θ ]. Then, if we let cos φ = a/A and sin φ = b/A, then this becomes A [ sin θ cos φ + cos θ sin φ ] = A sin(θ + φ). That works. So, yes, A is sqrt(a² + b²), and φ = arctan(b/a) if a is not zero. So, in this problem, a is the coefficient of sin 2x, which is 1, and b is the coefficient of cos 2x, which is sqrt(3). Therefore, A = sqrt(1² + (sqrt(3))²) = sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2. So, the amplitude is 2. That matches the 2 sin 2x function. So then, the phase shift φ is arctan(b/a) = arctan(sqrt(3)/1) = arctan(sqrt(3)). Hmm, arctan(sqrt(3)) is pi/3, since tan(pi/3) = sqrt(3). So, phi is pi/3. Therefore, the function f(x) can be written as 2 sin(2x + pi/3). Wait, but let's check that. If I expand 2 sin(2x + pi/3) using the sine addition formula: 2 [ sin 2x cos(pi/3) + cos 2x sin(pi/3) ]. Cos(pi/3) is 1/2 and sin(pi/3) is sqrt(3)/2. So, this becomes 2 [ sin 2x*(1/2) + cos 2x*(sqrt(3)/2) ] = 2*(1/2 sin 2x) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2 cos 2x) = sin 2x + sqrt(3) cos 2x. Perfect, that matches f(x). So, f(x) is indeed 2 sin(2x + pi/3). But the question is about shifting the graph of y = 2 sin 2x to get f(x). The original function is 2 sin 2x, and f(x) is 2 sin(2x + pi/3). To go from 2 sin 2x to 2 sin(2x + pi/3), we need to shift the graph. Remember that for a function sin(Bx + C), the phase shift is -C/B. So, in this case, the phase shift is -pi/3 divided by 2. Wait, let me recall the formula.The general form is y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D, where C is the phase shift. So, if we have 2 sin(2x + pi/3), we can write it as 2 sin[2(x + pi/6)]. Because 2(x + pi/6) = 2x + pi/3. So, the phase shift is -pi/6. Wait, phase shift C in y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D is C, so if it's written as sin(Bx + C'), then C' = -B*C, so C = -C'/B. So, in this case, the original function is 2 sin(2x + pi/3). So, comparing to 2 sin(2(x - C)), we have 2x + pi/3 = 2(x - C). Let's solve for C. 2x + pi/3 = 2x - 2C. Subtract 2x: pi/3 = -2C. Therefore, C = -pi/(6). So, the phase shift is -pi/6, which means shifting to the left by pi/6 units. Because a positive phase shift in the form (x - C) is a shift to the right by C. So, a negative phase shift would be a shift to the left. Therefore, shifting the graph of y = 2 sin 2x to the left by pi/6 units gives us y = 2 sin(2(x + pi/6)) = 2 sin(2x + pi/3), which is f(x). So, the answer should be A: pi/6 units. Let me check the options again. The options are A: pi/6, B: pi/3, C: pi/4, D: pi/12. So, A is pi/6. That matches my calculation. But let me just double-check my steps. Starting with f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt(3) cos 2x. We converted this to amplitude 2 and phase shift pi/3, resulting in 2 sin(2x + pi/3). To get from 2 sin 2x to 2 sin(2x + pi/3), we have to shift left by pi/6. Because the phase shift formula: if you have sin(kx + phi) = sin(k(x + phi/k)), so the shift is phi/k. Here, phi is pi/3, and k is 2, so the shift is pi/3 divided by 2, which is pi/6. Since it's +phi inside, it's a shift to the left. Alternatively, another way to think: the original function is 2 sin 2x. If we replace x with x + h, then the function becomes 2 sin[2(x + h)] = 2 sin(2x + 2h). We need this to equal 2 sin(2x + pi/3). Therefore, 2h = pi/3, so h = pi/6. Hence, shifting to the left by pi/6. Therefore, the answer is A. I think that's solid. The other answer choices are pi/3, which would be if the coefficient was 1 instead of 2, maybe. Let's see: if someone thought that the phase shift was pi/3, but since the coefficient of x is 2, the actual shift is pi/6. So, pi/6 is the correct answer, which is option A.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>To determine how much the graph of ( y = 2 sin 2x ) needs to be shifted to the left to obtain the graph of ( f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3} cos 2x ), we start by expressing ( f(x) ) in the form ( A sin(2x + phi) ).1. Combine the sine and cosine terms:   [   f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3} cos 2x   ]   We use the identity ( a sin theta + b cos theta = A sin(theta + phi) ) where ( A = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ), ( cos phi = frac{a}{A} ), and ( sin phi = frac{b}{A} ).2. Calculate the amplitude ( A ):   [   A = sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2   ]3.

Rewrite ( f(x) ) using the amplitude and phase shift:   [   f(x) = 2 sin left( 2x + frac{pi}{3} right)   ]5. Determine the horizontal shift:   The function ( 2 sin left( 2x + frac{pi}{3} right) ) can be written as ( 2 sin left( 2 left( x + frac{pi}{6} right) right) ). This indicates a left shift of ( frac{pi}{6} ).Thus, the graph of ( y = 2 sin 2x ) needs to be shifted to the left by ( frac{pi}{6} ) units.[boxed{A}],<think>Okay, so I need to figure out how much to shift the graph of y = 2 sin 2x to the left to get the graph of f(x) = sin 2x + √3 cos 2x. The options are in terms of pi, which makes me think it's related to phase shifting a trigonometric function. Let me recall how phase shifts work with sine and cosine functions.First, I remember that a function like A sin θ + B cos θ can be rewritten as a single sine or cosine function with a phase shift. The formula is something like C sin(θ + φ) or C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. Let me check the exact formula.Yes, the identity is A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where C = √(A² + B²) and tan φ = B/A. Alternatively, it can also be written as C cos(θ - φ) with a different phase shift. I need to make sure which one applies here.Given f(x) = sin 2x + √3 cos 2x, which is of the form A sin θ + B cos θ where θ = 2x, A = 1, and B = √3. So, according to the identity, C should be √(1² + (√3)²) = √(1 + 3) = √4 = 2. So, the amplitude is 2, which matches the given function y = 2 sin 2x. That makes sense because the original function f(x) can be rewritten as 2 times a sine function with some phase shift.Now, to find the phase shift φ. Using tan φ = B/A = √3 / 1 = √3. So, φ is the angle whose tangent is √3. Since tan(π/3) = √3, that means φ = π/3. Wait, but hold on. If we use the identity A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), then:C sin(θ + φ) = C sin θ cos φ + C cos θ sin φ. Comparing with A sin θ + B cos θ, we have:A = C cos φB = C sin φTherefore, tan φ = B/A = √3 / 1 = √3. So φ = π/3. Therefore, f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). But the original function is f(x) = sin 2x + √3 cos 2x. So, if I factor out the 2, it's 2 [ (1/2) sin 2x + (√3/2) cos 2x ]. The terms inside the brackets are sin(2x) cos(π/3) + cos(2x) sin(π/3) because cos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/3) = √3/2. So, that simplifies to sin(2x + π/3). Therefore, f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3).But the question is about shifting the graph of y = 2 sin 2x. So, comparing y = 2 sin 2x with f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). Let's recall that a phase shift in the function sin(kx + φ) is given by -φ/k. So, if we have sin(kx + φ) = sin(k(x + φ/k)), which is a shift to the left by φ/k units. Wait, let's verify that.Suppose we have sin(kx + φ). Let me write it as sin(k(x + φ/(k))). So, that would be a horizontal shift. For example, sin(k(x + h)) corresponds to a shift left by h units. So, in this case, h = φ/k. So, the phase shift is h = φ/k. So, in our case, φ is π/3, and k is 2. Therefore, the horizontal shift is π/3 divided by 2, which is π/6. So, the graph of y = 2 sin 2x shifted left by π/6 units becomes y = 2 sin(2(x + π/6)) = 2 sin(2x + π/3), which is exactly our function f(x). Therefore, the answer should be A: π/6.Wait, but let me check again. Let me think of the general formula: if we have a function sin(kx + φ), then the phase shift is -φ/k. Wait, different sources sometimes define phase shift differently. For example, if you have y = sin(k(x - h)), then h is the phase shift. So, if we have y = sin(kx + φ), that's equivalent to y = sin(k(x + φ/k)), so the phase shift is -φ/k, meaning a shift to the left by φ/k. Therefore, in this case, φ is π/3, so the shift is π/3 divided by k, which is 2, so π/6 to the left. Therefore, the answer is π/6, which is option A.But let me cross-verify by expanding f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). Let's expand this using the sine addition formula:2 sin(2x + π/3) = 2 [ sin 2x cos π/3 + cos 2x sin π/3 ] = 2 [ sin 2x*(1/2) + cos 2x*(√3/2) ] = 2*(1/2) sin 2x + 2*(√3/2) cos 2x = sin 2x + √3 cos 2x, which matches f(x). So, that works.Therefore, to go from y = 2 sin 2x to f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3), we replace x with x + π/6, which is a shift to the left by π/6. Therefore, the correct answer is A: π/6. Let me check the options again. The options are:A: π/6B: π/3C: π/4D: π/12So, answer is A.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that when we write 2 sin(2x + π/3), the phase shift is indeed π/6. Because the general formula is for y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, the phase shift is -C/B. So here, C is π/3 and B is 2. Therefore, phase shift is -π/3 / 2 = -π/6. A negative phase shift would mean a shift to the right by π/6. But in our case, we have a positive phase shift inside the sine function: sin(2x + π/3). So, is the phase shift to the left or right?Wait, confusion arises here. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have y = sin(x + π/2). This is equivalent to sin(x - (-π/2)), so phase shift is -π/2, which is a shift to the left by π/2. Because replacing x with x + π/2 shifts the graph to the left. Alternatively, if we have y = sin(Bx + C), then we can write it as sin(B(x + C/B)), so it's a shift to the left by C/B. So in this case, C is π/3 and B is 2, so shift left by π/(3*2) = π/6. Therefore, the phase shift is to the left by π/6. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is A.Alternatively, if we write y = 2 sin(2(x + π/6)), that's the same as 2 sin(2x + π/3). So, replacing x with x + π/6 in the original function y = 2 sin 2x gives us the desired function. Therefore, shifting left by π/6.Therefore, the answer is A. I think that's correct. Let me check if any step was wrong. The key steps were using the amplitude-phase form, calculating the phase shift, then translating that into a horizontal shift. The calculation seems correct. The expansion also checks out. So, I think A is the correct answer.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>To determine how much the graph of ( y = 2 sin 2x ) needs to be shifted to the left to obtain the graph of ( f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3} cos 2x ), we start by expressing ( f(x) ) in the form of a single sine function with a phase shift.The given function is ( f(x) = sin 2x + sqrt{3} cos 2x ).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I know that 36 is 6 squared, which is also 6^2, and 36^k would be (6^2)^k = 6^(2k). But maybe it's simpler to just think of 36 as 36 and work with exponents directly. Similarly, 5^m is straightforward. The problem is asking for the smallest positive difference between these two expressions when k and m are positive integers.Since both 36^k and 5^m grow exponentially, their differences could vary a lot depending on the exponents. My goal is to find the combination of k and m that makes 36^k just slightly larger than 5^m, so their difference is minimized but still positive. Alternatively, maybe 5^m is slightly larger than 36^k, but since we want a positive difference, we need 36^k to be the larger one.Let me start by testing small values of k and m. Since k and m are positive integers, the smallest they can be is 1.Starting with k = 1:36^1 = 36Then I need to find an m such that 5^m is just less than 36. Let's compute 5^m values:m=1: 5m=2: 25m=3: 125So m=3 gives 125, which is larger than 36. So the closest 5^m less than 36 is 25 (m=2). The difference would be 36 - 25 = 11.Alternatively, maybe m=3 gives 125, which is bigger than 36, but 36^1=36 is smaller than 125, so the difference would be negative (36 - 125 = -89), which we don't want. So with k=1, the only positive difference is 11.Now, let's check k=2:36^2 = 1296Now find m such that 5^m is just below 1296. Let's compute 5^m:5^1 = 55^2 = 255^3 = 1255^4 = 6255^5 = 31253125 is larger than 1296, so the closest 5^m less than 1296 is 625 (m=4). The difference is 1296 - 625 = 671. That's a much larger difference than 11.If we check m=5 (3125), then 36^2=1296 is less than 3125, so the difference would be negative. So not useful here.Moving on to k=3:36^3 = 36*36*36 = 36*1296 = 46656Looking for 5^m just below 46656. Let's compute higher exponents of 5:5^5 = 31255^6 = 156255^7 = 7812578125 is larger than 46656, so the closest is m=7: 78125. Wait, no, 5^7 is 78125 which is bigger than 46656, so the closest lower one is m=6: 15625. Then the difference is 46656 - 15625 = 31031. That's even larger. So clearly, as k increases, 36^k grows much faster than 5^m, so the differences get larger. So maybe k=1 gives the smallest difference so far.But wait, maybe for higher k, if we can find a 5^m that's very close to 36^k, maybe even closer than 11. Let me check for k=1, m=2 gives difference 11. Let's check if there's a k and m where 36^k is just slightly larger than 5^m, maybe by 1 or 2.Alternatively, maybe for larger exponents, the 5^m can approach 36^k more closely? Let's see.Alternatively, perhaps consider taking logarithms to find when 36^k ≈ 5^m. Taking natural logs, k*ln(36) ≈ m*ln(5). So the ratio of m/k is approximately ln(36)/ln(5). Compute that:ln(36) = ln(6^2) = 2*ln(6) ≈ 2*1.7918 ≈ 3.5836ln(5) ≈ 1.6094So ln(36)/ln(5) ≈ 3.5836 / 1.6094 ≈ 2.226So m/k ≈ 2.226. So m ≈ 2.226k. So for each k, if we take m as approximately 2.226k, then 5^m would be close to 36^k.But since m has to be an integer, perhaps we can look for k and m where m is close to 2.226k, and compute the differences.Alternatively, maybe use continued fractions to find good approximations of the ratio ln(36)/ln(5) to find integers m and k such that m/k ≈ ln(36)/ln(5). But that might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, let's try some small k and compute m such that 5^m is near 36^k.For example, k=1: 36. Find m where 5^m is near 36. We saw m=3: 125, which is too big. m=2:25. Difference is 11.k=2: 1296. Find m where 5^m near 1296. 5^5=3125, 5^4=625. 625 is too low, 3125 too high. Difference 1296-625=671.k=3: 46656. 5^7=78125, which is higher. 5^6=15625. 46656-15625=31031.k=4: 36^4 = 36*36*36*36 = 36^2*36^2=1296*1296=1679616. Then 5^m near this. Let's compute log base 5 of 1679616. m = log5(1679616) = ln(1679616)/ln(5) ≈ 14.034 / 1.6094 ≈ 8.72. So m≈8.72, so try m=8 and m=9.5^8 = 390625, 5^9=1953125. 1953125 is larger than 1679616. The difference is 1679616 - 1953125 is negative, so 1953125 -1679616=273509. But since we need positive, 1679616 - 390625=1288991. Which is still large.So even as k increases, the difference isn't getting smaller. So maybe the minimal difference is at k=1, m=2 with 11. But wait, let's check if there's another combination.Wait, maybe k=2 and m=5? 36^2=1296, 5^5=3125. 3125-1296=1829, which is a positive number, but since we need 36^k -5^m to be positive, but 1296 <3125, so 36^2 -5^5 is negative. So not acceptable.Wait, perhaps if we consider higher k, but then 36^k becomes enormous, but 5^m would have to catch up. But since 36 is larger than 5, and both are exponents, 36^k will outpace 5^m as k increases, but even for k=1, the difference was 11. Wait, maybe for k=1, m=3 gives 36 -125 = -89, which is negative, so not allowed.Wait, maybe if we consider k=3, m=7. 36^3=46656, 5^7=78125. Then 46656 -78125= negative, so no good. If m=6, 5^6=15625. Then 46656 -15625=31031.Hmm, so seems like the minimal difference so far is 11. Let's check other small k and m.Wait, k=1, m=2: 36 -25=11.Is there a case where 36^k is just 1 more than 5^m? For example, 5^m +1=36^k. Are there any such numbers?Like 5^0 +1=2, which is not a power of 36, but m must be positive. So m=1:5+1=6, not a power of 36. m=2:25+1=26, not a power. m=3:125+1=126, no. m=4:625+1=626, nope. Similarly, 36^k -1=5^m. Let's see 36 -1=35. Is 35 a power of 5? 5^3=125, so no. 36^2 -1=1296-1=1295, which is not a power of 5. 5^4=625, 5^5=3125. So no. So that approach doesn't help.Alternatively, maybe 36^k -5^m=2? Let's check. 36-25=11, 36-125=-89, 1296-625=671, etc. Not 2.Alternatively, check if 5^m + some small number is 36^k.Wait, maybe for k=2, m=5: 36^2=1296, 5^5=3125. 1296 vs 3125. Not close. How about k=3, m=7: 46656 vs 78125. Still not close.Alternatively, maybe k=1, m=3: 36 vs 125. 125-36=89. Not helpful.Wait, perhaps if we take k and m both larger. Wait, but since 36 grows faster than 5, the difference 36^k -5^m would become larger as k increases, unless m is increased as well. But to make 5^m close to 36^k, m has to be roughly proportional to k times ln(36)/ln(5) ≈2.226k. So if k=3, m≈6.678, so m=7. Then 5^7=78125 vs 36^3=46656. 78125-46656=31469, which is a large difference. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe trying k=2 and m=4: 1296 -625=671. Not better than 11.Wait, maybe there's a combination where 36^k is slightly larger than 5^m. For example, 5^m is just less than 36^k, but close. For k=1, m=2 gives 25 vs 36. Difference 11.What about k=2, m=5? 5^5=3125 vs 36^2=1296. 1296 is less than 3125, so 3125-1296=1829. If we take k=3, m=7: 46656 vs 78125. 78125-46656=31469. So it's getting worse.Alternatively, maybe m=3, k=1: 125 vs 36, which is 125-36=89. Not helpful.Wait, perhaps the minimal positive difference is indeed 11. Let me check if there's a smaller difference with other k and m.Wait, let's check k=1, m=2: 36 -25=11.k=1, m=1:36 -5=31. Which is bigger than 11.k=2, m=4:1296 -625=671.k=3, m=6:46656 -15625=31031.k=4, m=8: 36^4= 36*36*36*36= 36^2=1296; 1296*1296=1679616. 5^8=390625. Difference is 1679616 -390625=1,288,991. Which is even bigger.So, as k increases, the difference becomes much larger, so maybe the minimal difference is indeed 11. But wait, perhaps I missed some other combinations.Wait, let me check k=2 and m=3: 36^2=1296 vs 5^3=125. 1296 -125=1171. Which is still larger than 11.k=3 and m=4: 36^3=46656 vs 5^4=625. 46656 -625=46031. Still bigger.k=1, m=2 is 11. What about k=1, m=3:36 vs 125, difference is 89. So 125-36=89. Negative if we subtract the other way, but since we need 36^k -5^m positive, so m=3 gives negative. So m=2 is the only one for k=1.Wait, perhaps m=0, but m has to be positive. So m=1 is the smallest. So 5^1=5, 36-5=31. Which is bigger than 11.Alternatively, maybe k=0, but k must be positive. So k starts at 1.Wait, maybe check k=1, m=2: difference 11. Is there any possible k and m where 36^k is just 1 or 2 more than 5^m? Let's see:If 36^k -5^m=1, then 36^k=5^m +1. Are there any such numbers? Let's check small m:m=1:5 +1=6. 6 is not a power of 36.m=2:25 +1=26. Not a power of 36.m=3:125 +1=126. Not a power.m=4:625 +1=626. Not a power.m=5:3125 +1=3126. 36^3=46656. Not close.Similarly, 36^k=5^m +2:m=1:5+2=7. Not a power.m=2:25+2=27. 27 is 3^3, not 36^k.m=3:125+2=127. Not a power.m=4:625 +2=627. Not.So no luck there. So the minimal difference might be 11.Wait, but let's check another approach. Maybe there's a case where 36^k and 5^m are closer for higher exponents. For example, check k=2 and m=5: 1296 vs 3125. Difference 1829. Not close. k=3, m=7: 46656 vs 78125. Difference 31469. Hmm.Wait, another idea: perhaps using modular arithmetic to see if 36^k can be congruent to 5^m modulo some number, which might restrict possible values. For example, modulo 5. Let's see:36 ≡ 1 mod 5, because 36 divided by 5 is 7 with remainder 1. So 36^k ≡ 1^k =1 mod 5.5^m ≡ 0 mod 5. Therefore, 36^k -5^m ≡1 -0=1 mod5. So the difference is congruent to 1 mod5. Therefore, the smallest possible positive difference must be 1,6,11,16,... But we saw that 1 is not achievable, so the next is 6, 11, etc.Earlier, we found a difference of 11. Is there a difference of 6? Let's check:If 36^k -5^m=6, then 36^k=5^m +6. Let's test small m:m=1:5 +6=11. 11 is not a power of 36.m=2:25 +6=31. Not a power.m=3:125 +6=131. No.m=4:625 +6=631. No.Similarly, m=5:3125 +6=3131. Not a power.So 6 is not achievable. Next, 11. We have 36 -25=11. So that works. Then 16.Check if 36^k -5^m=16. So 36^k=5^m +16.Test m=1:5 +16=21. Not a power.m=2:25 +16=41. No.m=3:125 +16=141. No.m=4:625 +16=641. No.Similarly, no luck. So 11 is the first possible difference in the sequence. Since 11 is achievable, and the next possible difference would be 16, which isn't achievable, then 11 is the minimal positive difference.But wait, perhaps for higher k and m, 36^k -5^m=11. But 36^k is going to be much larger than 5^m as k increases, unless m is increased proportionally. But given the growth rates, 36^k will outpace 5^m. So once k increases beyond 1, the minimal difference increases. So 11 is indeed the smallest possible.Alternatively, maybe for k=1, m=2 gives 11, and that's the minimal. Let me confirm once again.Check k=1:36^1=36. Check 5^m less than 36:m=1:5, m=2:25, m=3:125 (too big). So the closest is 25. 36-25=11.k=2:36^2=1296. 5^m less than 1296: m=4:625, m=5:3125 (too big). 1296-625=671.k=3:36^3=46656. 5^m less than that: m=6:15625, m=7:78125 (too big). 46656-15625=31031.Thus, it's clear that as k increases, 36^k increases much more rapidly than 5^m, so the difference between them becomes larger. Hence, the minimal positive difference must occur at the smallest possible k, which is k=1, giving a difference of 11.Therefore, the smallest positive value of 36^k -5^m is 11, achieved when k=1 and m=2.Final AnswerThe smallest positive value is boxed{11}.</think>To find the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^m) where (k) and (m) are positive integers, we start by testing small values of (k) and (m).1. For (k = 1):   - (36^1 = 36)   - We need to find (m) such that (5^m) is just less than 36.   - (5^2 = 25) (closest value less than 36)   - Difference: (36 - 25 = 11)2. For (k = 2):   - (36^2 = 1296)   - We need to find (m) such that (5^m) is just less than 1296.   - (5^4 = 625) (closest value less than 1296)   - Difference: (1296 - 625 = 671)3. For (k = 3):   - (36^3 = 46656)   - We need to find (m) such that (5^m) is just less than 46656.   - (5^6 = 15625) (closest value less than 46656)   - Difference: (46656 - 15625 = 31031)4. For higher values of (k):   - The values of (36^k) grow much faster than (5^m), resulting in even larger differences.By checking small values and considering the exponential growth rates, we find that the smallest positive difference occurs at (k = 1) and (m = 2), giving (36 - 25 = 11).Thus, the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^m) is (boxed{11}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^m) where (k) and (m) are positive integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, let me understand what the problem is asking. I need to consider different values of (k) and (m), compute (36^k) and (5^m), subtract the latter from the former, and find the smallest positive result. Both (k) and (m) have to be positive integers, so they start from 1 onwards.Since both 36 and 5 are positive integers greater than 1, their powers will grow exponentially. So as (k) and (m) increase, (36^k) and (5^m) will get very large. Therefore, it's likely that the smallest positive difference occurs for small values of (k) and (m). Maybe even the smallest possible values, like (k=1) and (m=1)? Let me check that first.For (k=1) and (m=1): (36^1 - 5^1 = 36 - 5 = 31). That's a positive number. Is there a smaller positive difference possible? Let's try other combinations.Next, let's try (k=1) and (m=2): (36 - 25 = 11). That's smaller than 31. Okay, 11. What about (k=1) and (m=3): (36 - 125 = -89). That's negative, so we don't want that. Since increasing (m) when (k=1) will make (5^m) surpass 36, so the next one is negative. So for (k=1), the possible positive differences are 31 ((m=1)) and 11 ((m=2)). The smallest is 11.Now check (k=2). (36^2 = 1296). Let's see what (5^m) can get close to 1296. Let's compute powers of 5:(5^1 = 5)(5^2 = 25)(5^3 = 125)(5^4 = 625)(5^5 = 3125). Wait, 3125 is larger than 1296, so the closest lower power is (5^4 = 625). So (1296 - 625 = 671). That's a positive difference, but 671 is way larger than 11. If we take (m=5), then (1296 - 3125 = -1829), which is negative. So for (k=2), the smallest positive difference is 671. That's still bigger than 11.How about (k=3)? (36^3 = 36*36*36 = 36*1296 = 46656). Then (5^m) would need to be close to that. Let's see the nearest powers of 5. The exponents of 5 grow as 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, 78125. So 5^7 is 78125, which is larger than 46656. So the closest lower power is (5^6 = 15625). So the difference is (46656 - 15625 = 31031). That's way larger than 11. So clearly, as (k) increases, the difference becomes larger. So maybe (k=1) and (m=2) gives the smallest so far, which is 11.Wait, but maybe there's a combination with (k=2) and some (m) where (5^m) is just slightly less than (36^2 = 1296). Let me check. So (5^5 = 3125) is too big, (5^4 = 625). Then 1296 - 625 = 671, as before. What if there's a higher (m) such that (5^m) is just below 1296? Let's see: 5^5 is 3125, which is way higher. 5^4 is 625, which is 671 less than 1296. So no, there's no (m) where 5^m is closer to 1296. So maybe (k=2) doesn't help.Alternatively, maybe (k=3) and (m=7): (36^3 = 46656), (5^7 = 78125). Then (78125 - 46656 = 31469), which is positive, but that's larger than 11. So the difference is even bigger. So higher (k) seems worse.Wait, but maybe for some (k) and (m), (36^k) and (5^m) are close to each other? For example, maybe (k=2), (m=5): (36^2 = 1296), (5^5 = 3125). The difference is 1296 - 3125 = -1829. Negative. Not helpful. How about (k=3), (m=7): as above, 46656 - 78125 = negative. So seems like when (k) increases, 36^k is overtaken by higher 5^m, but the difference is still large.Alternatively, maybe check (k=1) and higher (m): when (k=1), (36^1 = 36). So 5^m must be less than 36. The largest such (m) is 2, since (5^3=125). So (m=2) gives 25, difference 11. So that's already covered.Wait, let's check if maybe (k=2) and (m=3): 36^2 - 5^3 = 1296 - 125 = 1171. Still larger than 11.Alternatively, maybe (k=3) and (m=5): (36^3 - 5^5 = 46656 - 3125 = 43531). Nope, still too big.Hmm. So perhaps 11 is the smallest. But let me check other combinations with (k=1), (m=2). Is there a way to get a smaller positive difference? Let's see.Wait, let's check (k=2) and (m=4): 1296 - 625 = 671. Still larger than 11.What about (k=3) and (m=6): 46656 - 15625 = 31031. Nope.Alternatively, maybe (k=4): 36^4 is 36*36*36*36 = 36^2 * 36^2 = 1296*1296 = 1,679,616. Then 5^m closest to that. 5^8 is 390625, 5^9 is 1,953,125. So 1,953,125 - 1,679,616 = 273,509. So positive, but way larger than 11.Wait, but perhaps negative differences? But we need positive. So maybe 11 is the smallest so far. But let me check for other combinations.Wait, perhaps trying (k=2) and (m=5): 1296 - 3125 = -1829. Negative, so not useful.Alternatively, let me check if there are any other possible combinations where the difference is positive and less than 11. Let's see.For (k=1), (m=1): 36 - 5 = 31.(k=1), (m=2): 36 -25=11.(k=1), (m=3): 36-125=-89.So, no, with (k=1), the next (m) gives negative.What about (k=2) and (m=3): 1296 -125=1171.Still much bigger. So maybe 11 is the smallest. Wait, but hold on. Let me check (k=3) and (m=5): 46656 - 3125 = 43531.No. Wait, maybe for (k=1), (m=2) is 11. Then for (k=2), (m=4) is 671, which is higher. For (k=3), even higher. So 11 seems better.But wait, let me check if there's another pair where (36^k) is just slightly larger than (5^m). For example, maybe (k=2), (m=4): 1296 - 625 = 671. Still a big difference. How about (k=3), (m=6): 46656 - 15625 = 31031. Hmm.Alternatively, is there a case where (36^k) is just one more than (5^m)? For example, 36 - 25 =11, 1296 - 625=671, etc. 11 is not 1. So maybe 11 is the minimal.Wait, but let's check for (k=2), (m=5): 1296 - 3125 = -1829. Negative. Not helpful.Alternatively, is there a case where (36^k) and (5^m) are consecutive numbers? Like 36 and 25 are 11 apart. 1296 and 625 are 671 apart. So no, not consecutive.Wait, perhaps even smaller differences. Let me try with (k=1), (m=2): 11. Then, check if for some higher (k) and (m), (36^k) and (5^m) are closer. For example, maybe (k=2), (m=4): 1296 vs 625, difference 671. Not closer.Alternatively, (k=3), (m=7): 46656 vs 78125, difference 31469. Not helpful.Wait, perhaps check (k=1), (m=0): but (m) has to be positive integer, so (m=0) is not allowed. So the smallest (m) is 1.Alternatively, check (k=0), but (k) has to be positive integer as well. So (k=0) is invalid.So with (k) and (m) starting at 1, the possible differences for (k=1) are 31, 11, -89, etc. So 11 is the smallest positive.But wait, let's see if there's a case where (36^k) and (5^m) are closer for some (k) and (m). For example, is there a case where (36^k -5^m = 1)? That would be the minimal possible positive difference. Let's check if that's possible.So, solving (36^k -5^m =1). Let's see if this equation has solutions in positive integers (k, m).For (k=1): (36 -5^m =1) implies (5^m=35). But 35 is not a power of 5.For (k=2): (1296 -5^m=1) implies (5^m=1295). 1295 divided by 5 is 259. 259 is not a power of 5 (5^3=125, 5^4=625). So no.For (k=3): 36^3 -5^m=1 => 46656 -5^m=1 => 5^m=46655. Let's divide 46655 by 5: 46655/5=9331. 9331 is not divisible by 5 (ends with 1). So not a power of 5.Similarly, higher (k) would give even larger numbers, which are unlikely to be 1 more than a power of 5. So no solution here. Therefore, the difference of 1 is impossible.What about difference 2? (36^k -5^m=2). Let's check.For (k=1): 36 -5^m=2 =>5^m=34. Not a power of 5.(k=2): 1296 -5^m=2 =>5^m=1294. Not a power of 5.(k=3): 46656 -5^m=2 =>5^m=46654. Not a power of 5. Similarly, no.Difference 3:Same approach. (k=1):5^m=33. No. (k=2):5^m=1293. No. (k=3):5^m=46653. No.Difference 4:Similarly. (k=1):5^m=32. 32 is 2^5, not a power of 5. (k=2):5^m=1292. Not a power. (k=3):5^m=46652. No.Difference 5:(k=1):5^m=31. No. (k=2):5^m=1291. No. (k=3):5^m=46651. No.Difference 6:(k=1):5^m=30. No. (k=2):5^m=1290. No.Difference 7:Same, no.Difference 8:Similarly.Difference 9:Nope.Difference 10:(k=1):5^m=26. 26 isn't a power of 5. (k=2):5^m=1296-10=1286. Not a power of 5.So, the next possible difference is 11, which we already found. So 11 is the smallest possible positive difference.Wait, but let me check for (k=2) and (m=3): 1296 - 125 = 1171.Alternatively, if we take (k=1), (m=2), difference 11. If there's another combination where the difference is between 1 and 11, then 11 wouldn't be the minimal. But according to the above checks, there are no solutions for differences 1 through 10. So 11 is the smallest possible.But to be thorough, let me check other values. For example, (k=3), (m=7): 46656 - 78125 = -31469. Negative. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe (k=4), (m= something). But (36^4 = 1,679,616). The nearest power of 5 would be (5^9 = 1,953,125). Then difference is 1,953,125 - 1,679,616 = 273,509. Still positive, but way larger than 11.Wait, but actually (5^9) is larger than (36^4), so the difference would be negative if we subtract (5^9) from (36^4). But if we take (5^8 = 390,625), then (1,679,616 - 390,625 = 1,288,991). Still much larger than 11.So, no improvement here.Alternatively, maybe (k=5), but the numbers get even larger. So the differences are going to be in the millions or more, so definitely not smaller than 11.Therefore, it seems that (36^1 -5^2 = 36 -25 =11) is the smallest positive difference.But wait, let me check (k=1) and (m=2) gives 11. What about (k=2) and (m=5): 1296 -3125= -1829. No. What about (k=4) and (m=8): 36^4 -5^8= 1,679,616 - 390,625 = 1,288,991. Still larger.Alternatively, is there a case where (5^m) is just 1 less than (36^k)? For example, (5^m =36^k -1). Let's see if such (k) and (m) exist.For (k=1): (5^m=35). Not possible.(k=2): (5^m=1295). 1295 divided by 5 is 259, which isn't a power of 5.(k=3): (5^m=46655). 46655 divided by 5 is 9331, which isn't a power of 5.So again, no solutions here.Alternatively, (5^m =36^k +1). But that would be a negative difference, which we don't want. We are looking for positive differences where (36^k >5^m).So, considering all possibilities, the smallest positive difference occurs at (k=1), (m=2) with a value of 11. Let me confirm once again to make sure I didn't miss any possible combinations.Check (k=1), (m=1): 31.(k=1), (m=2):11.(k=1), (m=3): Negative.(k=2), (m=1):1296 -5=1291.(k=2), (m=2):1296 -25=1271.(k=2), (m=3):1171.(k=2), (m=4):671.(k=2), (m=5):Negative.So, the minimal here is 671, which is larger than 11.Similarly, (k=3), minimal difference is 31031.Hence, 11 is indeed the smallest positive difference.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{11}.Final Answerboxed{11}</think>To find the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^m) where (k) and (m) are positive integers, we start by evaluating the expression for small values of (k) and (m).1.

Checking for other possible values of (k) and (m) to see if the difference can be 1 through 10, we find no valid solutions as the resulting values do not match powers of 5.After evaluating all combinations for small (k) and (m), the smallest positive value is found when (k = 1) and (m = 2), resulting in (36 - 25 = 11).Thus, the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^m) is (boxed{11}).]"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = begin{cases} 2^{x}, & x leqslant 0  1 - log_{2} x, & x > 0 end{cases}, find f(f(-2)) = ______.","solution":"Since the function f(x) = begin{cases} 2^{x}, & x leqslant 0  1 - log_{2} x, & x > 0 end{cases},First, we find f(-2).

So, the function f(x) is defined piecewise: it's 2^x when x is less than or equal to 0, and 1 minus the logarithm base 2 of x when x is greater than 0. We need to find f(f(-2)). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.First, I need to compute f(-2). Since -2 is less than or equal to 0, we'll use the first part of the piecewise function, which is 2^x. So, substituting x = -2 into that, we get 2^(-2). Wait, 2 to the power of -2. Remember that negative exponents mean reciprocals, right? So, 2^(-2) is the same as 1/(2^2), which is 1/4. So, f(-2) is 1/4. That seems straightforward.Now, the next step is to compute f(f(-2)), which is f(1/4). Since 1/4 is 0.25, which is greater than 0, we need to use the second part of the piecewise function: 1 - log base 2 of x. So, substituting x = 1/4 into this part, we get 1 - log2(1/4). Hmm, let me recall. Logarithm base 2 of 1/4 is asking, \\"2 raised to what power gives 1/4?\\" Well, 2^(-2) is 1/4, so log2(1/4) should be -2. Therefore, 1 - (-2) equals 1 + 2, which is 3. So, f(1/4) is 3. Therefore, f(f(-2)) equals 3.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First part: f(-2). Since -2 ≤ 0, use 2^x. 2^(-2) = 1/4. Correct. Then f(1/4) because 1/4 > 0, use 1 - log2(1/4). Log2(1/4) is log2(2^(-2)) which is -2. So 1 - (-2) is 3. Yeah, that seems right. Maybe I can verify the logarithm part again. Let me confirm. 2^0 is 1, 2^-1 is 1/2, 2^-2 is 1/4. So log2(1/4) is indeed -2. So subtracting that negative gives a positive. Yep, 1 - (-2) is 3. Alright, that checks out.So, putting it all together: f(-2) = 1/4, then f(1/4) = 3. Therefore, f(f(-2)) = 3. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick or anything here. The function is piecewise, but the steps seem straightforward. The first evaluation at -2 uses the exponential part, then the result is positive, so the second evaluation uses the logarithmic part. Both steps seem to follow correctly. No hidden steps or operations. So, I think confident that the answer is 3.Final Answerboxed{3}</think>To find ( f(f(-2)) ) for the given function ( f(x) ):1.

So, we have this piecewise function f(x) defined differently depending on whether x is less than or equal to zero or greater than zero. The question is asking for f(f(-2)). Hmm, that means I need to first find f(-2) and then use that result to find the next f value. Let me break it down.First, let's understand the function f(x). It's split into two cases:1. For x ≤ 0, f(x) = 2^x.2. For x > 0, f(x) = 1 - log base 2 of x.Alright, so when x is negative or zero, we use the exponential part, and when x is positive, we use the logarithmic part. Now, we need to compute f(f(-2)). Let's start with the inner function: f(-2).Since -2 is less than 0, we use the first case: f(-2) = 2^(-2). Let me calculate that. 2 to the power of -2 is the same as 1 divided by 2 squared. 2 squared is 4, so 1/4. So, f(-2) = 1/4. Got that part.Now, we have to find f(1/4) because that's the outer function in f(f(-2)). Now, 1/4 is 0.25, which is greater than 0. So, we need to use the second case of the piecewise function: f(x) = 1 - log₂(x).So, f(1/4) = 1 - log₂(1/4). Let's compute the logarithm part. Log base 2 of 1/4. Hmm, 2 to what power gives 1/4? Well, 2^2 is 4, so 2^(-2) is 1/4. Therefore, log₂(1/4) = -2. So, substituting back into the equation: f(1/4) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with f(-2): since -2 ≤ 0, use 2^x. 2^(-2) is 1/4. Correct. Then f(1/4): 1/4 > 0, so use 1 - log₂(1/4). Log₂(1/4) is log₂(2^(-2)) which is -2. So, 1 - (-2) is 3. Yep, that looks right.But let me verify each step again just to be thorough. Maybe there's a trick here I didn't notice. The function is piecewise, so making sure we're applying the right part each time. First, x = -2: definitely in the first case. Calculated 2^(-2) = 1/4. Then x = 1/4: positive, so second case. Log₂(1/4) is indeed -2, so subtracting that gives 1 - (-2) = 3. Seems solid.Alternatively, if I wasn't sure about the logarithm, maybe I can convert log₂(1/4) into a different form. Let's see. Remember that log_b(a) = c means b^c = a. So, 2^c = 1/4. Solving for c, since 1/4 is 2^(-2), then c is -2. Therefore, log₂(1/4) = -2. So, that part checks out.Another way to think about the logarithm: log₂(1/4) = log₂(1) - log₂(4) = 0 - 2 = -2. Because log(a/b) = log a - log b. Yeah, that also gives the same result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, f(1/4) = 1 - (-2) = 3. So, f(f(-2)) = f(1/4) = 3. Therefore, the answer should be 3. Let me just write that in the required format. But before that, let me check once more.Wait, 2^(-2) is 1/(2^2) which is 1/4. Correct. Then log base 2 of 1/4 is -2, so 1 - (-2) = 3. Yep. So, all steps are correct. I think that's the right answer. No mistakes in the reasoning here.Final Answerboxed{3}</think>To find ( f(f(-2)) ) for the given piecewise function ( f(x) ), we proceed as follows:1.

Hmm, that's a bit of a nested logarithm problem. Let me break it down step by step. First, let's write the equation out clearly:log₄(log₃(log₂x)) = 0Alright, log base 4 of something equals 0. I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So applying that here, since the log base 4 of something is 0, that something must be 4^0. So log₃(log₂x) = 4^0 = 1. Now we have log base 3 of (log base 2 of x) equals 1. Let's apply the same logic again. log base 3 of something equals 1, so that something is 3^1. Therefore, log₂x = 3^1 = 3. Now we have log base 2 of x equals 3. Again, converting that back, x = 2^3 = 8. Wait, so x is 8. Let me check the answer options. Option A is 8. So is that the answer? Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the outside:1. log₄( ... ) = 0 implies that the inside part must be 4^0 = 1. So log₃(log₂x) = 1. Correct.2. Then, log₃( ... ) = 1 implies that the inside part is 3^1 = 3. So log₂x = 3. Correct.3. Then, log₂x = 3 implies x = 2^3 = 8. Correct.So each step checks out. Therefore, x = 8 is the solution. Let me make sure that all the logarithms are defined here. First, log base 2 of x. Since x = 8, which is positive, that's okay. Then log base 3 of log base 2 of x. Since log₂8 = 3, which is positive, log base 3 of 3 is 1, which is positive. Then log base 4 of 1 is 0, which is okay. So all the domains are satisfied. Looking back at the options, A is 8. B is -8, but log of a negative number is undefined, so x can't be negative. C is 0, which is also invalid for logarithm. D is 4, which would lead to log₂4 = 2, log₃2 ≈ 0.6309, then log₄ of that would be log base 4 of a number less than 1, which is negative, but logarithm is only defined for positive numbers. Wait, actually log₃2 is positive, because 2 is positive. So log₄(log₃(log₂4)) would be log₄(log₃2). Log base 4 of something less than 1 is negative, but the original equation is equal to 0, which is not negative. So x=4 is invalid. Option E is 10. Let's check that too. log₂10 ≈ 3.3219, log₃ of that ≈ log₃(3.3219) ≈ 1.046, then log base 4 of 1.046 is approximately 0.067, which isn't 0. So E is not correct. Therefore, after checking all possibilities, the correct answer is A, x=8.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>To solve the equation (log_{4} log_{3} log_{2} x = 0), we start by converting the outermost logarithm to its exponential form. 1. Since (log_{4} (log_{3} (log_{2} x)) = 0), we convert this to:   [   log_{3} (log_{2} x) = 4^0 = 1   ]2. Next, we convert the resulting logarithm (log_{3} (log_{2} x) = 1) to its exponential form:   [   log_{2} x = 3^1 = 3   ]3. Finally, we convert (log_{2} x = 3) to its exponential form:   [   x = 2^3 = 8   ]We verify that all logarithms are defined for (x = 8). The value (log_{2} 8 = 3) is positive, (log_{3} 3 = 1) is positive, and (log_{4} 1 = 0) is valid. Therefore, the solution is (x = 8).The correct answer is (boxed{A}).,<think>Okay, so I need to solve this equation: log base 4 of (log base 3 of (log base 2 of x)) equals 0. Hmm, that's a bit complicated with three layers of logarithms. Let me take it step by step. First, I remember that when you have a logarithm equal to zero, like log_b(something) = 0, then that something must be b raised to the power of 0, which is 1. Because log_b(1) is 0. So maybe I can work from the outside in. Starting with the outermost logarithm: log base 4 of something equals 0. Let me write that down. If log₄(A) = 0, then A must be 4⁰ = 1. So, the inner part, which is log base 3 of (log base 2 of x), must equal 1. So now, the equation simplifies to log₃(log₂x) = 1. Okay, next step. If log base 3 of something equals 1, then that something must be 3¹ = 3. Therefore, log base 2 of x must equal 3. So now, log₂x = 3. To solve for x, I can rewrite this in exponential form. That means x = 2³ = 8. Wait, so x equals 8? Let me check the answer choices. Option A is 8. So that's probably the answer. But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting over: log₄(log₃(log₂x)) = 0. Let's substitute x = 8. First, compute the innermost logarithm: log₂8. Since 2³ = 8, log₂8 is 3. Then, the next logarithm is log₃3. Since 3¹ = 3, that's 1. Then, the outermost logarithm is log₄1. Since 4⁰ = 1, that's 0. Which matches the original equation. So yes, x = 8 works. Looking at the options, A is 8. The other options are -8, 0, 4, 10. Let me see if any of those could also work. But wait, logarithms are only defined for positive numbers. So x has to be positive. Therefore, options B (-8) and C (0) are invalid because you can't take the logarithm of a negative number or zero. So those are out. Option D is 4. Let's test x = 4. First, log₂4 is 2. Then log₃2. Hmm, 3 to the what power is 2? That's log base 3 of 2, which is approximately 0.6309. Then log₄ of 0.6309. But log base 4 of a number less than 1 is negative, but the original equation has log base 4 of something equals 0, which requires that something to be 1. But log₃(log₂4) = log₃2 ≈ 0.6309, which is not 1. So that doesn't work. How about option E, x = 10? Let's check that. log₂10 is approximately 3.3219. Then log₃(3.3219) is approximately 1. Because 3^1 = 3 and 3^1.5 is about 5.196, so it's somewhere between 1 and 1.5. Let me calculate it more accurately. log₃(3.3219) = ln(3.3219)/ln(3) ≈ 1.199/1.0986 ≈ 1.091. So then log₄(1.091) is log base 4 of that, which would be approximately 0.091 divided by log(4) which is around 0.091 / 0.602 ≈ 0.151. Which is not 0. So that doesn't work either. So the only valid solution is x = 8, which is option A. I think that's solid. Each step unwrapping the logarithms by converting them into exponentials step by step. Also checked the other options and saw they don't work. So I'm confident the answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}</think>To solve the equation (log _{4} log _{3} log _{2} x = 0), we start by working from the outermost logarithm inward.1.

This is a basic problem.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I have this problem here: A number x is randomly selected from the interval [0, 3]. What is the probability that x is less than or equal to 1? Hmm, let me think. I remember that when dealing with probabilities over an interval, it's usually about the length of the interval where the event occurs divided by the total length of the interval. Is that right?Let me confirm. If we have a uniform distribution over an interval, which I think is the case here since it's just saying a number is randomly selected, then the probability of picking a number within a certain subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval. So, the probability P that x ≤ 1 should be the length of [0, 1] divided by the length of [0, 3]. Calculating the lengths: The interval from 0 to 1 has a length of 1 - 0 = 1. The total interval from 0 to 3 has a length of 3 - 0 = 3. So then, the probability would be 1 divided by 3, which is 1/3.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem says \\"randomly selected from the interval [0,3]\\". So, assuming that \\"randomly selected\\" means uniformly random, right? So every number in the interval has an equal chance of being picked. In that case, the probability density function is constant over [0,3], and the probability of x being in any subinterval [a, b] is (b - a)/3.So, in this case, the subinterval is [0,1], which is from 0 to 1. So, the length is 1, divided by the total length 3. So yeah, 1/3. That seems straightforward. Is there any chance that the problem is trying to trick me? Like, maybe considering something else? For example, maybe non-uniform distribution? But the problem doesn't mention any specific distribution other than \\"randomly selected\\", which in math problems usually means uniform distribution unless stated otherwise. Alternatively, if they were using a different distribution, like normal distribution or something, they would have specified. But since it's an interval [0,3], and they just say randomly selected, uniform is the safe assumption here. Another check: the total probability over the entire interval should be 1. So, if we take the length of [0,3], which is 3, and divide each subinterval by 3, then the probability over the entire interval is 3/3 = 1, which makes sense. So, for [0,1], it's 1/3, and for [1,3], it's 2/3. So the probabilities add up to 1. That seems consistent. So I think the answer is 1/3. Wait, but let me think again. If I have a number line from 0 to 3, and I pick a number at random, the chance it's in the first third of the interval is 1/3. That matches with the calculation. Alternatively, if the interval was discrete, like integers from 0 to 3, the probability would be different. But the problem says a number is selected from the interval, so it's a continuous interval. So, in the continuous case, the probability is indeed the ratio of lengths. So, I can't see any mistake in my reasoning here. Therefore, the probability that x ≤ 1 is 1/3. Final AnswerThe probability that ( x leqslant 1 ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}.</think>A number ( x ) is randomly selected from the interval ([0, 3]). We need to find the probability that ( x leqslant 1 ).When dealing with a uniform distribution over an interval, the probability of selecting a number within a subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval. 1. The length of the interval ([0, 1]) is ( 1 - 0 = 1 ).2. The length of the total interval ([0, 3]) is ( 3 - 0 = 3 ).The probability ( P ) that ( x leqslant 1 ) is the ratio of the length of the subinterval ([0, 1]) to the length of the total interval ([0, 3]):[P = frac{text{Length of } [0, 1]}{text{Length of } [0, 3]} = frac{1}{3}]Thus, the probability that ( x leqslant 1 ) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}).,<think>Okay, so the problem is: A number x is randomly selected from the interval [0, 3]. What is the probability that x ≤ 1? Hmm, let's think about this step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with probabilities in a continuous interval, like between two numbers, the probability is related to the length of the interval where the event occurs divided by the total length of the interval. So, since the number is chosen randomly from [0, 3], the total possible outcomes are all numbers between 0 and 3. The event we're interested in is x being less than or equal to 1, which is the interval [0, 1].So, probability in such cases is usually the measure of the favorable interval divided by the measure of the entire interval. In this case, the measure would be the length since it's a one-dimensional interval. Let me verify that. Yeah, for continuous uniform distributions, the probability of an event is the length of the interval where the event occurs divided by the total length.Therefore, the total length of the interval [0, 3] is 3 - 0 = 3 units. The length of the interval where x ≤ 1 is 1 - 0 = 1 unit. So, the probability should be 1/3. That seems straightforward.Wait, but just to make sure I haven't missed anything. The problem says \\"randomly selected from the interval [0, 3]\\". Does that mean it's a uniform distribution? Yes, when they say randomly selected without specifying any other distribution, it's safe to assume a uniform distribution. In a uniform distribution, every number in the interval has an equal chance of being selected, so the probability density function is constant over [0, 3].So, confirming again, the probability that x is in [a, b] where [a, b] is a subinterval of [0, 3] is (b - a)/3. Here, a is 0 and b is 1, so (1 - 0)/3 = 1/3. Therefore, the probability should indeed be 1/3.Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the problem was discrete, but since it's specified as an interval [0, 3], it's definitely continuous. So, no, in discrete cases, like if we were picking integers, the probability would be different, but here it's a continuous interval. So, the answer is 1/3.Wait, let me think again. Maybe they consider some other factors. For example, sometimes problems can be tricky by mentioning endpoints or something. But in continuous probability, the probability of hitting an exact point is zero, so including the endpoint 1 doesn't change anything. So, whether it's x < 1 or x ≤ 1, the probability is the same because the probability that x is exactly 1 is zero. Therefore, the interval [0, 1] has the same probability as [0, 1), so 1/3.Another way to think about it: If I imagine the interval from 0 to 3 on a number line, and I randomly pick a point, the chance that it's in the first third of the interval (from 0 to 1) should be one third. That makes intuitive sense. If the interval was divided into three equal parts, each part would have length 1, and since the event is landing in the first part, the probability is 1/3.So, I think that's solid. The answer is 1/3. But just to recap:Total interval length: 3 (from 0 to 3)Favorable interval length: 1 (from 0 to 1)Probability: favorable / total = 1/3Yes, that seems right. I can't think of any reason this would be incorrect. Uniform distribution over an interval gives probabilities proportional to length. So, unless there's some detail I overlooked, which I don't think there is, the answer is 1/3.Final AnswerThe probability that ( x leqslant 1 ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}.</think>A number ( x ) is randomly selected from the interval ([0, 3]).

Calculate Eξ.","solution":"From the given information, the number of games required, ξ, can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.The probability of the match ending in 4 games, P(ξ=4), is calculated as follows:P(ξ=4) = (1/2)^4 + (1/2)^4 = 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/8The probability of the match ending in 5 games, P(ξ=5), is calculated as follows:P(ξ=5) = C(4,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 * 1/2 + C(4,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 * 1/2 = 1/4The probability of the match ending in 6 games, P(ξ=6), is calculated as follows:P(ξ=6) = C(5,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 * 1/2 + C(5,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 * 1/2 = 5/16The probability of the match ending in 7 games, P(ξ=7), is calculated as follows:P(ξ=7) = C(6,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^3 * 1/2 + C(6,3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^3 * 1/2 = 5/16Therefore, the expected value of ξ, Eξ, is calculated as follows:Eξ = 4 * 1/8 + 5 * 1/4 + 6 * 5/16 + 7 * 5/16 = 93/16Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{93}{16}}.This problem tests the distribution list of discrete random variables and mathematical expectation, and the students' computational ability.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.First, the series ends when either team A or team B wins 4 games. Each game is independent, and the probability of either team winning any game is 1/2. So, we're dealing with a binomial probability scenario, but with an absorbing state at 4 wins for either team. The expectation here is the average number of games needed until one of the teams reaches 4 wins.Wait, in a best-of-seven series, the maximum number of games that can be played is 7, right? Because once one team gets to 4 wins, the series is over. So, the possible number of games required can range from 4 to 7. But the expectation isn't just the average of 4,5,6,7 because the probabilities of the series ending at each of these numbers are different. So, I need to compute the probability that the series ends at 4, 5, 6, or 7 games, and then take the weighted average of these numbers multiplied by their respective probabilities.Let me formalize this. Let ξ be the number of games. Then,Eξ = 4 * P(ξ=4) + 5 * P(ξ=5) + 6 * P(ξ=6) + 7 * P(ξ=7)So, I need to compute each of these probabilities.Starting with P(ξ=4). For the series to end in 4 games, one of the teams must win all 4 games. The probability of team A winning 4 games in a row is (1/2)^4, and similarly for team B. So, total P(ξ=4) = 2 * (1/2)^4 = 2/16 = 1/8.Next, P(ξ=5). For the series to end in 5 games, one team must win 4 games, and the other team must win 1 game in the first 4 games, then the leading team wins the 5th game. Let's see, the probability that team A wins the series in 5 games is C(4,1) * (1/2)^4 * (1/2) = 4 * (1/2)^5 = 4/32. Similarly for team B. So total P(ξ=5) = 2 * 4/32 = 8/32 = 1/4.Wait, let me check that again. The number of ways team A can win 4 games with the last game being the 5th. So, in the first 4 games, team A must have 3 wins and 1 loss. The number of sequences is C(4,3) = 4. Then, the probability is 4 * (1/2)^4 * (1/2) = 4 * (1/2)^5 = 4/32. Then, same for team B, so 8/32 = 1/4. Okay, that seems right.Similarly, for P(ξ=6). The series ends in 6 games. So, one team wins 4 games, and the other wins 2 games in the first 5 games, then the leading team wins the 6th game. So, for team A to win in 6 games: C(5,2) * (1/2)^5 * (1/2) = 10 * (1/2)^6 = 10/64. Similarly for team B, so total P(ξ=6) = 2 * 10/64 = 20/64 = 5/16.Similarly, for P(ξ=7). The series ends in 7 games. So, one team wins 4 games, the other wins 3 games in the first 6 games, then the leading team wins the 7th game. For team A: C(6,3) * (1/2)^6 * (1/2) = 20 * (1/2)^7 = 20/128. Same for team B, so total P(ξ=7) = 2 * 20/128 = 40/128 = 5/16.Wait, let me check these probabilities add up to 1. Let's compute:P(4) = 1/8 = 0.125P(5) = 1/4 = 0.25P(6) = 5/16 = 0.3125P(7) = 5/16 = 0.3125Adding them up: 0.125 + 0.25 = 0.375; 0.375 + 0.3125 = 0.6875; 0.6875 + 0.3125 = 1.0. Perfect, they sum to 1.So, now computing Eξ:Eξ = 4*(1/8) + 5*(1/4) + 6*(5/16) + 7*(5/16)Let's compute each term:4*(1/8) = 0.55*(1/4) = 1.256*(5/16) = 30/16 = 1.8757*(5/16) = 35/16 ≈ 2.1875Adding them up: 0.5 + 1.25 = 1.75; 1.75 + 1.875 = 3.625; 3.625 + 2.1875 = 5.8125So, 5.8125 is equal to 93/16? Let me check:16*5 = 80, 93 - 80 = 13, so 93/16 = 5.8125. Yes.But wait, 93/16 is 5.8125. Hmm.But let me cross-verify this answer. I remember that in a best-of-seven series with equal probabilities, the expected number of games is 5.8125, which is 93/16. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, is there another way to compute this expectation?Alternatively, perhaps using recursion or states.Let me think. Let’s model the problem using states. Let’s define E(a, b) as the expected number of games remaining when team A has a wins and team B has b wins. We need to compute E(0, 0).The base cases are when a = 4 or b = 4, in which case E(a, b) = 0, since the series is over.For other states, the expected number of games is 1 (for the next game) plus the expected value of the resulting state, which can be either E(a+1, b) or E(a, b+1), each with probability 1/2.Therefore, the recursion is:E(a, b) = 1 + (E(a+1, b) + E(a, b+1)) / 2So, starting from E(3, 3), for example, if the score is 3-3, then the next game decides the series, so E(3, 3) = 1 + (E(4,3) + E(3,4))/2 = 1 + (0 + 0)/2 = 1.Similarly, E(3, 2): If team A has 3 wins and team B has 2, then the next game could result in A winning (and the series ends) or B winning, leading to 3-3. Therefore, E(3, 2) = 1 + (E(4,2) + E(3,3))/2 = 1 + (0 + 1)/2 = 1.5.Similarly, E(2, 3) would be the same by symmetry, 1.5.Going back another step: E(3,1). If the score is 3-1, then the next game can result in A winning (series ends) or B winning (3-2). Therefore, E(3,1) = 1 + (0 + E(3,2))/2 = 1 + (1.5)/2 = 1 + 0.75 = 1.75. Similarly, E(1,3) = 1.75.Similarly, E(3,0) = 1 + (0 + E(3,1))/2 = 1 + (1.75)/2 = 1 + 0.875 = 1.875. E(0,3) = 1.875.Moving to E(2,2): If the score is 2-2, the next game leads to 3-2 or 2-3. So,E(2,2) = 1 + (E(3,2) + E(2,3))/2 = 1 + (1.5 + 1.5)/2 = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5.E(2,1): Score 2-1. Next game can lead to 3-1 or 2-2. So,E(2,1) = 1 + (E(3,1) + E(2,2))/2 = 1 + (1.75 + 2.5)/2 = 1 + 4.25/2 = 1 + 2.125 = 3.125. Similarly, E(1,2) = 3.125.E(2,0): Score 2-0. Next game leads to 3-0 or 2-1.E(2,0) = 1 + (E(3,0) + E(2,1))/2 = 1 + (1.875 + 3.125)/2 = 1 + 5/2 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5. Similarly, E(0,2) = 3.5.E(1,1): Score 1-1. Next game leads to 2-1 or 1-2.E(1,1) = 1 + (E(2,1) + E(1,2))/2 = 1 + (3.125 + 3.125)/2 = 1 + 6.25/2 = 1 + 3.125 = 4.125.E(1,0): Score 1-0. Next game leads to 2-0 or 1-1.E(1,0) = 1 + (E(2,0) + E(1,1))/2 = 1 + (3.5 + 4.125)/2 = 1 + 7.625/2 = 1 + 3.8125 = 4.8125. Similarly, E(0,1) = 4.8125.Finally, E(0,0) = 1 + (E(1,0) + E(0,1))/2 = 1 + (4.8125 + 4.8125)/2 = 1 + 4.8125 = 5.8125. Which is the same as 93/16.Therefore, this method gives the same result as the first method, 93/16 = 5.8125. So, this confirms the answer.Alternatively, is there a combinatorial formula that can be used here?Yes, in general, for a best-of-n series (n odd or even?), the expected number of games can be calculated by summing over the possible series lengths. In our case, it's best-of-7, which actually requires up to 7 games. The formula as I used earlier:Eξ = sum_{k=4 to7} k * P(ξ=k)And we calculated each P(ξ=k) by considering the combinations.Alternatively, another formula for the expectation in such a scenario is:Eξ = sum_{a=0 to3} sum_{b=0 to3} (a + b + 1) * C(a + b, a) * (1/2)^{a + b + 1}But that might complicate things more. Wait, maybe not. Wait, let me see.Each possible series that ends when either a=4 or b=4. So, for each possible series length k (from 4 to7), the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game is C(k-1, 3) and similarly for team B.Therefore, the total number of sequences for length k is 2*C(k-1, 3). Each has probability (1/2)^k. Therefore, P(ξ=k) = 2*C(k-1,3)*(1/2)^k = C(k-1,3)*(1/2)^{k-1}But let's check for k=4: C(3,3)*(1/2)^3 = 1*(1/8) = 1/8. Correct.For k=5: C(4,3)*(1/2)^4 = 4*(1/16) = 1/4. Correct.k=6: C(5,3)*(1/2)^5 = 10*(1/32) = 5/16. Correct.k=7: C(6,3)*(1/2)^6 = 20*(1/64) = 5/16. Correct.Therefore, the formula holds. Therefore, the expectation is:Eξ = sum_{k=4}^7 k * C(k-1,3)*(1/2)^{k-1}Alternatively, we can write this as sum_{k=4}^7 k * C(k-1,3)*(1/2)^{k-1}But maybe there's a way to compute this sum more elegantly.Alternatively, note that in the recursion approach, we built up the expectation from the terminal states backwards. It gave the same result as the combinatorial approach.Alternatively, there might be a generating function approach.But given that we already have two methods confirming that Eξ = 93/16 = 5.8125, and the probabilities add up to 1, I think this is solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 93 divided by 16. 16*5=80, 93-80=13, so 5 and 13/16, which is 5.8125. Yes.Alternatively, 93/16 is the exact value. So, 93 over 16 cannot be simplified, so the answer is 93/16.Therefore, the expected number of games is 93/16, which is 5.8125.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{93}{16}}.Final AnswerThe expected number of games required is boxed{dfrac{93}{16}}.</think>To calculate the expected number of games ( Exi ) in a best-of-seven series where each team has a 50% chance of winning each game, we need to determine the probabilities of the series ending in 4, 5, 6, or 7 games and then compute the weighted average.1. Probability the series ends in 4 games (( P(xi=4) )):   - One team wins all 4 games.   - Probability: ( 2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{1}{8} ).2. Probability the series ends in 5 games (( P(xi=5) )):   - One team wins 4 games, and the other wins 1 game in the first 4 games.   - Probability: ( 2 times binom{4}{1} left(frac{1}{2}right)^5 = frac{1}{4} ).3. Probability the series ends in 6 games (( P(xi=6) )):   - One team wins 4 games, and the other wins 2 games in the first 5 games.   - Probability: ( 2 times binom{5}{2} left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 = frac{5}{16} ).4. Probability the series ends in 7 games (( P(xi=7) )):   - One team wins 4 games, and the other wins 3 games in the first 6 games.   - Probability: ( 2 times binom{6}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^7 = frac{5}{16} ).Next, we compute the expected value ( Exi ):[Exi = 4 times frac{1}{8} + 5 times frac{1}{4} + 6 times frac{5}{16} + 7 times frac{5}{16}]Calculating each term:- ( 4 times frac{1}{8} = 0.5 )- ( 5 times frac{1}{4} = 1.25 )- ( 6 times frac{5}{16} = 1.875 )- ( 7 times frac{5}{16} = 2.1875 )Summing these terms:[0.5 + 1.25 + 1.875 + 2.1875 = 5.8125]Expressing this as a fraction:[5.8125 = frac{93}{16}]Thus, the expected number of games required is (boxed{dfrac{93}{16}}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the expected number of games required for a best-of-seven series between Team A and Team B, where each game has a 50-50 chance of either team winning. The series ends when one team wins four games. Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves probability and expectation. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that expectation for a random variable is calculated by summing over all possible outcomes multiplied by their probabilities. So, in this case, ξ can take values from 4 to 7, right? Because the minimum number of games needed is 4 (if one team wins all four), and the maximum is 7 (if the series goes to the seventh game). So, maybe I can calculate the probability that the series ends in 4, 5, 6, or 7 games, then compute the expected value by multiplying each number of games by its probability and summing them up.Let me start with the probability that the series ends in 4 games. For this to happen, one of the teams must win all four games. Since each game is independent and the probability of winning each game is 1/2, the probability of Team A winning four in a row is (1/2)^4, and similarly for Team B. So the total probability for the series ending in 4 games is 2*(1/2)^4 = 2/16 = 1/8.Okay, that makes sense. Now, moving on to the series ending in 5 games. For this, one team must win four games, and the other must have won exactly one game before the fifth game. But importantly, the series must not have ended before the fifth game. So, the fourth win must come in the fifth game. That means in the first four games, the winning team must have exactly three wins and one loss. Then they win the fifth game. So the probability would be 2 * [C(4-1, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(4-1-3)] * (1/2). Wait, let me parse that.Wait, the number of ways the team can have three wins in the first four games is C(4,3) = 4. Then, the probability for one specific sequence is (1/2)^4, and then they win the fifth game with probability 1/2. So total probability is 2 * [C(4,3) * (1/2)^4] * (1/2) = 2 * 4 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 2 * 4 * (1/32) = 8/32 = 1/4. Is that right?Wait, let me check again. The logic is that for the series to end in exactly 5 games, one team must win their fourth game on the fifth game. So before the fifth game, they must have 3 wins and 1 loss. The number of sequences where they have 3 wins and 1 loss in the first four games is C(4,3) = 4. Then, they win the fifth game. Since either team can be the one to win the series, we multiply by 2. So the probability is 2 * [C(4,3) * (1/2)^4] * (1/2) = 2 * 4 * (1/16) * (1/2) = 2 * 4 * (1/32) = 8/32 = 1/4. Yes, that seems correct.Similarly, for the series ending in 6 games, the winning team must have their fourth win in the sixth game. So in the first five games, they have exactly 3 wins and 2 losses. The number of ways this can happen is C(5,3) = 10. Then they win the sixth game. So the probability is 2 * [C(5,3) * (1/2)^5] * (1/2) = 2 * 10 * (1/32) * (1/2) = 20 * (1/64) = 20/64 = 5/16.Wait, let me verify this step-by-step. For 6 games, one team needs to win exactly 3 of the first 5 games, then win the sixth. The number of ways is C(5,3) for each team. So, yes, 2 * C(5,3) * (1/2)^6 = 2 * 10 * 1/64 = 20/64 = 5/16. Correct.Similarly, for the series ending in 7 games, one team must have exactly 3 wins in the first 6 games, and then they win the seventh game. Wait, no. Actually, if the series goes to 7 games, that means after 6 games, both teams have exactly 3 wins each. Then the seventh game decides the winner. So the probability is the probability that after 6 games, it's 3-3, times the probability that someone wins the seventh game, which is 1 (since the game has to end here). But since each game is 50-50, the probability of 3-3 after six games is C(6,3) * (1/2)^6. Then, regardless of who wins the seventh game, the series ends. So the total probability is C(6,3)*(1/2)^6 * 1 = 20 * (1/64) = 20/64 = 5/16. Wait, but 5/16 is the same as for 6 games? Wait, no, let me check:Wait, the total probabilities should sum up to 1. Let's check:P(4) = 1/8P(5) = 1/4P(6) = 5/16P(7) = 5/16Sum: 1/8 + 1/4 + 5/16 +5/16 = Convert to sixteenths: 2/16 + 4/16 +5/16 +5/16 = 16/16 =1. Okay, that checks out.So now, to compute Eξ, the expectation, it's 4*P(4) +5*P(5) +6*P(6) +7*P(7).So let's compute each term:4*(1/8) = 4/8 = 0.55*(1/4) = 5/4 = 1.256*(5/16) = 30/16 = 1.8757*(5/16) = 35/16 ≈ 2.1875Adding them up: 0.5 +1.25 =1.75; 1.75 +1.875=3.625; 3.625 +2.1875=5.8125. So 5.8125 is equal to 93/16? Wait, 5.8125 *16=93. So yes, 93/16.Wait, 93 divided by 16 is 5.8125. So Eξ=93/16=5.8125. Hmm, is that correct?Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this expectation without having to compute each probability. Let me think.Another approach is to model this as a Markov chain, where each state represents the current number of wins for Team A and Team B. The states would be pairs (a, b) where a and b are the number of wins for each team so far. The terminal states are when a=4 or b=4. The expected number of games from each state can be defined recursively.But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, there's a formula for the expected number of games in a best-of-n series, which in this case is best-of-7, so n=7. But actually, best-of-7 is up to 7 games, first to 4 wins. So maybe there's a known formula for that.Alternatively, I recall that for a best-of-(2n-1) series, the expected number of games is something like 2n - 2n*(1/2)^{2n}*C(2n-1, n). Wait, not sure. Let me check.Alternatively, think of the problem as a negative binomial distribution, where we want the expected number of trials (games) needed to get 4 successes (wins for one team), but considering that both teams are competing to reach 4 wins.But perhaps the negative binomial isn't directly applicable here because it's a race between two teams. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as the expectation of the maximum of two negative binomial variables. Wait, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, think about the possible series as combinations of wins and losses. For the series to end in k games (k=4,5,6,7), the k-th game must be the fourth win for one team, and before that, the team had exactly 3 wins in the previous k-1 games.Therefore, the probability that the series ends in k games is 2*C(k-1, 3)*(1/2)^k for k=4,5,6,7. Wait, let's check for k=4: 2*C(3,3)*(1/2)^4 =2*1*(1/16)=1/8, which matches. For k=5: 2*C(4,3)*(1/2)^5=2*4*(1/32)=8/32=1/4, which matches. For k=6:2*C(5,3)*(1/2)^6=2*10*(1/64)=20/64=5/16. And for k=7:2*C(6,3)*(1/2)^7=2*20*(1/128)=40/128=5/16. So that's correct.Therefore, the expectation is the sum from k=4 to 7 of k*P(k). So that's 4*(1/8) +5*(1/4)+6*(5/16)+7*(5/16). Which we already calculated as 93/16=5.8125.But let me see if there's a more elegant way to compute this without summing each term. Maybe using linearity of expectation?Alternatively, think of each game beyond the first four as being played only if the series hasn't been decided yet. For example, the fifth game is played only if neither team has four wins after four games. Similarly, the sixth game is played only if neither team has four wins after five games, etc.So, we can model the expected number of games as 4 + E5 + E6 + E7, where E5 is the probability that a fifth game is needed, E6 is the probability that a sixth game is needed, and E7 is the probability that a seventh game is needed.But actually, since each subsequent game is only played if the previous ones didn't decide the series, the expectation can be written as:Eξ = 4 + P(series not decided in 4 games) + P(series not decided in 5 games) + P(series not decided in 6 games)Because each term represents the probability that the series continues beyond the 4th, 5th, and 6th games, thereby requiring an additional game.Wait, let me think again. If we consider the expectation as the sum over the indicator variables for each game being played. That is, let I_n be an indicator variable which is 1 if the nth game is played, 0 otherwise. Then, the total number of games ξ is the sum from n=1 to 7 of I_n. Therefore, the expectation Eξ is the sum from n=1 to7 of E[I_n] = sum from n=1 to7 of P(game n is played).So, to calculate Eξ, we can compute for each game 1 through 7, the probability that the series hasn't ended before that game. So, for game 1, it's definitely played, so P=1. For game 2, it's played if neither team has already won 4 games, which after 1 game is impossible, so P=1. Similarly, games 3 and 4 are always played, since you can't have a team with 4 wins before 4 games. So games 1-4 are always played, so their indicators are 1. For game 5, it's played only if after 4 games, neither team has 4 wins, i.e., the series is 2-2, 3-1, or 1-3. Wait, no. Wait, after 4 games, the possible records are 4-0, 3-1, 2-2, 1-3, 0-4. The series ends if it's 4-0 or 0-4. So the probability that game 5 is played is 1 - P(4-0) - P(0-4) = 1 - 2*(1/2)^4 = 1 - 2/16 = 14/16 = 7/8.Similarly, game 6 is played only if after 5 games, neither team has 4 wins. So to compute that, we need the probability that after 5 games, neither team has 4 wins. Which would be 1 - P(Team A has 4 wins after 5 games) - P(Team B has 4 wins after 5 games).To compute P(Team A has 4 wins after 5 games), that's equal to C(5-1, 4-1)*(1/2)^5 = C(4,3)*(1/2)^5 = 4/32 = 1/8. Similarly for Team B. So total probability is 2*(1/8) = 1/4. Therefore, P(game 6 is played) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.Similarly, game 7 is played only if after 6 games, neither team has 4 wins. The probability of that is 1 - P(Team A wins 4 in 6) - P(Team B wins 4 in 6). For Team A, it's C(6-1,4-1)*(1/2)^6 = C(5,3)*(1/2)^6 = 10/64 = 5/32. Similarly for Team B, so total 10/64 +10/64=20/64=5/16. Therefore, P(game 7 is played)=1 -5/16=11/16.Wait, but let's check that. If after 6 games, the series is 3-3, then game 7 is played. So the probability that the series is 3-3 after 6 games is C(6,3)*(1/2)^6 = 20/64 =5/16. Therefore, game 7 is played with probability 5/16. Wait, no: If the series is not decided after 6 games, that means it's 3-3, which has probability 5/16. Therefore, P(game 7 is played)=5/16. Wait, conflicting with previous calculation.Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong. Let me clarify.If we want the probability that game 7 is played, it's equal to the probability that after 6 games, neither team has 4 wins. That occurs only if the series is 3-3. So that's C(6,3)*(1/2)^6 =20/64=5/16. Therefore, P(game 7 is played)=5/16.Similarly, for game 5: the series is not decided after 4 games. That is, the record after 4 games is not 4-0, 0-4, or 3-1, 1-3. Wait, no, actually, after 4 games, if either team has 4 wins, the series is over. So the series is not decided only if neither team has 4 wins. But in 4 games, the maximum number of wins is 4. So the only way the series is not decided is if neither team has 4 wins. So possible records are 0-4, 1-3, 2-2, 3-1, 4-0. The series ends if it's 4-0 or 0-4. So the probability that the series is not decided after 4 games is 1 - P(4-0) - P(0-4) =1 - 2*(1/16)=14/16=7/8. Therefore, game 5 is played with probability 7/8.Similarly, game 6 is played only if the series is not decided after 5 games. After 5 games, the possible records are 5-0 (impossible, since max is 4 wins), 4-1, 3-2, 2-3, 1-4. So the series ends if a team has 4 wins. So the probability that the series is not decided after 5 games is 1 - P(4-1) - P(1-4). P(4-1) is C(5-1,4-1)*(1/2)^5 = C(4,3)* (1/32) =4/32=1/8. Similarly for P(1-4). So total probability of series ending after 5 games is 2*(1/8)=1/4. Therefore, the probability that game 6 is played is 1 -1/4=3/4.Similarly, for game 7, as we said, it's played with probability5/16.So then, using this approach, the expected number of games is the sum from n=1 to7 of P(game n is played). So:Game 1: 1Game 2:1Game 3:1Game 4:1Game5:7/8Game6:3/4Game7:5/16Therefore, Eξ=4 +7/8 +3/4 +5/16Convert to sixteenths:4 =64/167/8=14/163/4=12/165/16=5/16Adding up:64 +14 +12 +5=95. So 95/16=5.9375. Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of93/16=5.8125. What's going on here?Wait, there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?Wait, in the first approach, calculating the expectation by multiplying each possible game number by its probability and summing up gave us93/16≈5.8125.But in the second approach, using linearity of expectation and summing the probabilities of each game being played gives us95/16≈5.9375. These results are different. Therefore, one of the approaches is wrong.I need to figure out which is correct.Wait, let's check the two approaches again. First, the initial calculation:P(4)=1/8, P(5)=1/4, P(6)=5/16, P(7)=5/16. So Eξ=4*(1/8)+5*(1/4)+6*(5/16)+7*(5/16). Let's compute this again:4*(1/8)=0.55*(1/4)=1.256*(5/16)=1.8757*(5/16)=2.1875Sum:0.5+1.25=1.75;1.75+1.875=3.625;3.625+2.1875=5.8125=93/16.Second approach: Eξ= sum of P(game n is played). So games 1-4:1 each, so 4. Then game5:7/8, game6:3/4, game7:5/16. So total:4 +7/8 +3/4 +5/16.Compute:7/8=0.8753/4=0.755/16≈0.3125So total:4 +0.875=4.875; +0.75=5.625; +0.3125=5.9375=95/16≈5.9375.But these two results are different. Which one is correct?Wait, let's check for a simpler case. Let's suppose we have a best-of-1 series. Then, obviously, the expected number of games is1. According to the first approach, possible games:1, so P(1)=1. Eξ=1*1=1. According to the second approach, games1:1, sum=1. Correct.Another test case: best-of-3 series. First team to 2 wins. What is the expected number of games?First approach: Possible games 2 or3.P(2)=2*(1/2)^2=1/2.P(3)=1 -1/2=1/2.Eξ=2*(1/2) +3*(1/2)=1 +1.5=2.5.Second approach: Games1:1, game2:1, game3:P(series not decided after 2 games). The series is decided after 2 games if one team has 2 wins. Probability is P(2-0) +P(0-2)=2*(1/2)^2=1/2. So game3 is played with probability1 -1/2=1/2. So Eξ=2 +1/2=2.5. Correct. So both approaches agree here.Wait, so in the best-of-3 case, both approaches give the same result. Then why in the best-of-7 case, the two approaches differ? There must be an error in one of the approaches.Wait, let's see. In the best-of-3 case, the second approach is summing game1 + game2 + game3*P(game3 is played). But in the best-of-3, game3 is only played if the series is 1-1 after two games. So the expectation is 2 + P(game3 is played)*1. Which is correct.In the best-of-7 case, the first approach gives 93/16≈5.8125, the second approach gives95/16≈5.9375. Which is correct?Wait, let's check with another method. Maybe simulate all possible series. Since each game is independent, and the probability is 1/2, we can use recursion.Let’s define E(a, b) as the expected number of games remaining when Team A needs 'a' more wins and Team B needs 'b' more wins to clinch the series. We need to compute E(4,4).The recursive formula would be:E(a, b) = 1 + 0.5*E(a-1, b) + 0.5*E(a, b-1), for a >0 and b >0.Base cases: E(0, b)=0 for any b, and E(a,0)=0 for any a.So let's compute E(4,4):First, we need to compute all E(a,b) for a and b from 0 to4.Let me create a table:Starting from E(0, b)=0 and E(a,0)=0.Compute E(1,1):E(1,1) =1 +0.5*E(0,1) +0.5*E(1,0) =1 +0.5*0 +0.5*0=1.E(1,2):=1 +0.5*E(0,2) +0.5*E(1,1)=1 +0 +0.5*1=1.5.E(2,1):Same as E(1,2)=1.5.E(1,3):=1 +0.5*E(0,3) +0.5*E(1,2)=1 +0 +0.5*1.5=1 +0.75=1.75.E(3,1):Same as E(1,3)=1.75.E(1,4):=1 +0.5*E(0,4) +0.5*E(1,3)=1 +0 +0.5*1.75=1 +0.875=1.875.E(4,1):Same as E(1,4)=1.875.E(2,2):=1 +0.5*E(1,2) +0.5*E(2,1)=1 +0.5*1.5 +0.5*1.5=1 +1.5=2.5.E(2,3):=1 +0.5*E(1,3) +0.5*E(2,2)=1 +0.5*1.75 +0.5*2.5=1 +0.875 +1.25=3.125.E(3,2):Same as E(2,3)=3.125.E(2,4):=1 +0.5*E(1,4) +0.5*E(2,3)=1 +0.5*1.875 +0.5*3.125=1 +0.9375 +1.5625=3.5.E(4,2):Same as E(2,4)=3.5.E(3,3):=1 +0.5*E(2,3) +0.5*E(3,2)=1 +0.5*3.125 +0.5*3.125=1 +3.125=4.125.E(3,4):=1 +0.5*E(2,4) +0.5*E(3,3)=1 +0.5*3.5 +0.5*4.125=1 +1.75 +2.0625=4.8125.E(4,3):Same as E(3,4)=4.8125.Finally, E(4,4)=1 +0.5*E(3,4) +0.5*E(4,3)=1 +0.5*4.8125 +0.5*4.8125=1 +4.8125=5.8125=93/16.Therefore, this recursive approach gives 93/16≈5.8125, which matches the first method. Therefore, the error must be in the second approach.Wait, so why does the second approach give 95/16 instead of93/16?Let me check the second approach again. The reasoning was that the expectation can be written as the sum over each game being played. So, ξ= I₁ +I₂ +I₃ +I₄ +I₅ +I₆ +I₇, where Iₙ is 1 if game n is played, 0 otherwise. Therefore, Eξ= E[I₁] + E[I₂] + ... + E[I₇]. Since expectation is linear.Each E[Iₙ]=P(game n is played). So, games1-4: always played, so E[I₁] to E[I₄] are 1. Then E[I₅] =P(series not decided after 4 games). E[I₆]=P(series not decided after5 games). E[I₇]=P(series not decided after6 games).But wait, according to the recursive computation, the expected number of games is93/16≈5.8125, which is approximately5.8125. However, according to summing the probabilities, it's4 +7/8 +3/4 +5/16=95/16≈5.9375. So which is correct?The recursive method is more trustworthy here, because it's a standard dynamic programming approach. Therefore, the error must be in the second approach. But why?Wait, the key is that when we sum E[I₅] + E[I₆] + E[I₇], these are the probabilities that each respective game is played. But in reality, game5 is played if the series is not decided after4 games. Similarly, game6 is played only if the series is not decided after5 games, which is dependent on game5 being played. So, the events are not independent. Wait, but expectation linearity doesn't require independence. So even if the events are dependent, E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]. So regardless of dependencies, the expectation of the sum is the sum of the expectations. Therefore, the second approach should be correct. But why the discrepancy?Wait, wait, no. The error is in how we compute P(game6 is played). Let me check that. If game6 is played only if the series is not decided after5 games. However, for the series to be not decided after5 games, it must not have been decided after4 games and then not decided after5 games. But in the second approach, we computed P(game6 is played) as1 - P(series decided in5 games). But the correct way is that game6 is played if the series was not decided after5 games, which requires that the series was not decided after4 games AND not decided after5 games. Wait, no. Actually, if game5 is played, then game6 is played only if after5 games, the series is not decided. But game5 is played only if after4 games, the series is not decided. Therefore, P(game6 is played)= P(series not decided after4 games AND series not decided after5 games).But in the previous calculation, I computed P(game6 is played) as1 - P(series decided in5 games). But that is incorrect, because the series could have been decided in4 games, in which case game5 wouldn't be played, hence game6 wouldn't be played either. Therefore, P(game6 is played)= P(series not decided after4 games AND series not decided after5 games).Therefore, it's the probability that the series was not decided after4 games and not decided after5 games. So, it's P(not decided after4) * P(not decided after5 | not decided after4).Similarly, for game7, it's P(not decided after4,5,6 games).Therefore, the second approach was incorrectly calculating P(game5 is played)=7/8, P(game6 is played)=3/4, P(game7 is played)=5/16. But actually, these probabilities should be conditional. For example, game6 is played only if game5 was played and the series wasn't decided after5 games. So:E[I5] = P(series not decided after4 games).E[I6] = P(series not decided after4 games AND series not decided after5 games).E[I7] = P(series not decided after4,5,6 games).Therefore, these are conditional probabilities. So:P(game5 is played)=P(not decided after4)=7/8.P(game6 is played)=P(not decided after4 and not decided after5)=P(not decided after5 | not decided after4)*P(not decided after4).Similarly, after4 games, if it's not decided, then the possible records are1-3,2-2,3-1. So starting from each of those, the probability that after5 games it's not decided.Wait, maybe an easier way is to compute P(not decided after5 games)= P(not decided after4 games) * P(not decided after5 games | not decided after4 games).But given that after4 games, the series is not decided, so possible records are1-3,2-2,3-1.For each of these, the probability that the series is not decided after5 games.If after4 games it's1-3, then in game5, if the trailing team wins, it's2-3; if the leading team wins, it's1-4 (series over). So, P(not decided after5 games |1-3 after4 games)= probability that the trailing team wins game5, which is1/2.Similarly, if after4 games it's3-1, similar logic: P(not decided after5 games |3-1 after4 games)=1/2.If after4 games it's2-2, then game5 will make it3-2 or2-3. So in either case, not decided. Therefore, P(not decided after5 games |2-2 after4 games)=1.Therefore, the overall P(not decided after5 games | not decided after4 games)= [P(1-3 after4)*1/2 + P(2-2 after4)*1 + P(3-1 after4)*1/2] / P(not decided after4).First, compute P(1-3 after4 games). The series is not decided after4 games, which is7/8. The probability distribution of the records given that it's not decided after4 games is:For the possible records:1-3,2-2,3-1. Each has probability:P(1-3)=C(4,1)*(1/2)^4=4/16.Similarly, P(3-1)=4/16.P(2-2)=C(4,2)*(1/2)^4=6/16.Total not decided:4+6+4=14/16=7/8.So conditional probabilities:P(1-3 | not decided)=4/14=2/7.P(2-2 | not decided)=6/14=3/7.P(3-1 | not decided)=4/14=2/7.Therefore, P(not decided after5 games | not decided after4 games)=(2/7)*1/2 + (3/7)*1 + (2/7)*1/2 =(2/7)*(1/2 +1/2) +3/7*1= (2/7)*1 +3/7=5/7.Therefore, P(game6 is played)= P(not decided after4 and after5 games)= P(not decided after4)*P(not decided after5 | not decided after4)=7/8 *5/7=5/8.Similarly, to compute P(game7 is played)= P(not decided after4,5,6 games).First, compute P(not decided after6 games | not decided after4,5 games).But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, note that this approach leads to the same result as the first method. However, given the time constraints, perhaps it's best to accept that the recursive method gives93/16≈5.8125, which is the correct answer.Therefore, the error in the second approach was that it didn't account for the conditional probabilities when computing P(game6 and game7 are played). Instead, it computed them as unconditional probabilities, which is incorrect. The correct way requires multiplying by the probability that previous games were played and the series wasn't decided, which complicates the calculation.Hence, the first method and the recursive method both give93/16 as the expectation, which is the correct answer.Therefore, the expected number of games required is93/16, which is5.8125.Final AnswerThe expected number of games required is boxed{dfrac{93}{16}}.</think>To find the expected number of games required for a best-of-seven series between Team A and Team B, where each game has a 50-50 chance of either team winning, we need to calculate the probabilities of the series ending in 4, 5, 6, or 7 games and then compute the expected value.1. Probability of the series ending in 4 games:   - One team must win all four games.   - Probability: (2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{1}{8}).2. Probability of the series ending in 5 games:   - One team must win four games, with three wins in the first four games.   - Probability: (2 times binom{4}{3} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^5 = frac{1}{4}).3. Probability of the series ending in 6 games:   - One team must win four games, with three wins in the first five games.   - Probability: (2 times binom{5}{3} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 = frac{5}{16}).4. Probability of the series ending in 7 games:   - The series is tied 3-3 after six games.   - Probability: (binom{6}{3} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 = frac{5}{16}).The expected value (E[xi]) is calculated by summing the products of the number of games and their respective probabilities:[E[xi] = 4 times frac{1}{8} + 5 times frac{1}{4} + 6 times frac{5}{16} + 7 times frac{5}{16}]Calculating each term:[4 times frac{1}{8} = frac{4}{8} = 0.5][5 times frac{1}{4} = frac{5}{4} = 1.25][6 times frac{5}{16} = frac{30}{16} = 1.875][7 times frac{5}{16} = frac{35}{16} = 2.1875]Summing these values:[0.5 + 1.25 + 1.875 + 2.1875 = 5.8125]Converting to a fraction:[5.8125 = frac{93}{16}]Thus, the expected number of games required is (boxed{dfrac{93}{16}}).]"},{"problem":"Given the expansion of (x-m)^{7}=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+ldots+a_{7}x^{7}, the coefficient of x^4 is -35,  (1) Find the value of a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{7};  (2) Find the value of a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}+a_{7}.","solution":"Since T_{r+1}= C_{7}^{r}x^{7-r}(-m)^{r}, 0 leq r leq 7, r in mathbb{Z},  then C_{7}^{3}(-m)^{3}=-35, thus m=1.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}+a_{7}=boxed{2^{6}}.","generations":"[<think>Alright, so I have this problem here about expanding (x - m)^7, and it tells me that the coefficient of x^4 is -35. Then there are two parts to the question: first, finding the sum of the coefficients from a1 to a7, and second, finding the sum of the odd-indexed coefficients a1, a3, a5, a7. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, let's recall the binomial expansion formula. The expansion of (x + y)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) x^{n-k} y^k. In this case, our expression is (x - m)^7, so it's like (x + (-m))^7. Therefore, each term in the expansion will be (7 choose k) x^{7 - k} (-m)^k. So the general term for the coefficient a_j is (7 choose k) (-m)^k where j = 7 - k. Wait, maybe I should adjust that. If the term is x^{7 - k}, then the exponent of x is 7 - k, so the coefficient a_{7 - k} is (7 choose k) (-m)^k. Therefore, to get the coefficient of x^4, we need 7 - k = 4, which means k = 3. So a_4 = (7 choose 3) (-m)^3. The problem states that this coefficient is -35, so we can set up the equation: (7 choose 3)(-m)^3 = -35. Let's compute (7 choose 3). That's 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5)/(3*2*1) = 35. So 35*(-m)^3 = -35. Therefore, (-m)^3 = -35 / 35 = -1. Then (-m)^3 = -1. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get -m = -1, so m = 1. Wait, let's check that again. If (-m)^3 = -1, then (-m) is the cube root of -1. The cube root of -1 is -1, so -m = -1, which implies m = 1. Okay, that seems right. So m is 1.Now that we know m = 1, the original expression becomes (x - 1)^7. Now, part (1) asks for the sum of the coefficients from a1 to a7. The coefficients a0 to a7 correspond to the coefficients of x^0 (constant term) up to x^7. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. So if we plug x = 1 into (x - 1)^7, we get (1 - 1)^7 = 0^7 = 0. That's the sum of all coefficients from a0 to a7. But the question asks for a1 + a2 + ... + a7, which is the total sum minus a0. So we need to compute a0 and subtract it from the total sum (which is 0). What is a0? a0 is the constant term of the expansion, which is the term when x = 0. So plugging x = 0 into (0 - 1)^7 = (-1)^7 = -1. Therefore, a0 = -1. Therefore, the sum a1 + a2 + ... + a7 = total sum - a0 = 0 - (-1) = 1. So part (1) answer is 1. Let me verify that. If we expand (x - 1)^7, the sum of coefficients at x=1 is 0, which is a0 + a1 + ... + a7. So subtracting a0 gives us 0 - (-1) = 1. That seems correct.Now part (2) asks for the sum of the odd-indexed coefficients: a1 + a3 + a5 + a7. There's a trick to find the sum of even and odd coefficients in a polynomial. If we evaluate the polynomial at x = 1 and x = -1, then:P(1) = a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7P(-1) = a0 - a1 + a2 - a3 + a4 - a5 + a6 - a7If we add P(1) and P(-1), we get 2(a0 + a2 + a4 + a6)If we subtract P(-1) from P(1), we get 2(a1 + a3 + a5 + a7)So since we want a1 + a3 + a5 + a7, we can compute [P(1) - P(-1)] / 2.We already know P(1) = 0. Let's compute P(-1). P(-1) is (-1 - 1)^7 = (-2)^7 = -128.Therefore, [0 - (-128)] / 2 = 128 / 2 = 64. So the sum of the odd-indexed coefficients is 64. Let me check this.Alternatively, maybe we can think about expanding (x - 1)^7. Let's write out the coefficients using the binomial theorem. The coefficients are (7 choose k)(-1)^k for k from 0 to 7. So:a0 = (7 choose 0)(-1)^0 = 1*1 = 1, but wait, when k=0, the term is (7 choose 0)x^7(-1)^0? Wait, no. Wait, the expansion is (x - 1)^7. So each term is (7 choose k)x^{7 - k}(-1)^k. So the coefficient of x^{7 - k} is (7 choose k)(-1)^k. Therefore, a0 is the coefficient of x^0, which is when 7 - k = 0, so k=7. Therefore, a0 = (7 choose 7)(-1)^7 = 1*(-1)^7 = -1, which matches our previous result. Similarly, a1 is the coefficient of x^1, which is when 7 - k = 1 => k=6. So a1 = (7 choose 6)(-1)^6 = 7*1 = 7.a2: k=5, (7 choose 5)(-1)^5 = 21*(-1) = -21a3: k=4, (7 choose 4)(-1)^4 = 35*1 = 35a4: k=3, (7 choose 3)(-1)^3 = 35*(-1) = -35 (matches the given)a5: k=2, (7 choose 2)(-1)^2 = 21*1 = 21a6: k=1, (7 choose 1)(-1)^1 = 7*(-1) = -7a7: k=0, (7 choose 0)(-1)^0 = 1*1 = 1So listing all coefficients:a0 = -1a1 = 7a2 = -21a3 = 35a4 = -35a5 = 21a6 = -7a7 = 1Now, let's compute a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7:7 + (-21) + 35 + (-35) + 21 + (-7) + 1Calculating step by step:7 -21 = -14-14 +35 = 2121 -35 = -14-14 +21 = 77 -7 = 00 +1 =1So that's 1, which matches our answer for part (1).Now for part (2), sum of a1 +a3 +a5 +a7:7 +35 +21 +1 = 7+35=42, 42+21=63, 63+1=64. So 64, which matches our previous calculation using the P(1) - P(-1) method. So that seems correct.Therefore, the answers are 1 and 64.But let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The key steps were:1. Find m by using the coefficient of x^4. Through binomial coefficient calculation, found m=1.2. For part (1), sum of coefficients from a1 to a7 is total sum (which is 0) minus a0 (which is -1), giving 1.3. For part (2), using the evaluation at x=1 and x=-1 to find the sum of odd coefficients. Since P(1)=0 and P(-1)=-128, then [0 - (-128)]/2 = 64.Alternatively, by expanding all coefficients manually and adding them up, which gives the same result.Therefore, confident that the answers are 1 and 64.Final Answer(1) boxed{1}(2) boxed{64}</think>Given the expansion of ((x - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ldots + a_7x^7), where the coefficient of (x^4) is -35, we need to find:1. The value of (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7)2. The value of (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7)First, we determine the value of (m). The coefficient of (x^4) in the expansion is given by the term (binom{7}{3}(-m)^3).

To find (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7), we note that the sum of all coefficients (from (a_0) to (a_7)) is obtained by evaluating the polynomial at (x = 1):[(1 - 1)^7 = 0]The constant term (a_0) is found by evaluating the polynomial at (x = 0):[(0 - 1)^7 = -1]Therefore, the sum (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_7) is:[0 - (-1) = 1]2. To find (a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7), we use the values of the polynomial at (x = 1) and (x = -1):[(1 - 1)^7 = 0 quad text{and} quad (-1 - 1)^7 = (-2)^7 = -128]The sum of the odd-indexed coefficients is given by:[frac{(0 - (-128))}{2} = frac{128}{2} = 64]Thus, the final answers are:1. (boxed{1})2. (boxed{64}),<think>Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have the expansion of (x - m)^7, and we're told that the coefficient of x^4 is -35. Then there are two parts to the problem: first, finding the sum a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₇, and second, finding the sum of the odd-indexed coefficients a₁ + a₃ + a₅ + a₇. Starting with part (1). Hmm, the expansion of (x - m)^7 is given, and we need the sum of coefficients from a₁ to a₇. Wait, but the constant term is a₀, right? Because when x=0, all the terms with x disappear, so a₀ is just (-m)^7. Then, if we want the sum of all coefficients from a₀ to a₇, that would be the value of the polynomial when x=1. Because substituting x=1 gives (1 - m)^7 = a₀ + a₁*1 + a₂*1² + ... + a₇*1⁷ = a₀ + a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₇. So the sum of all coefficients is (1 - m)^7. But the question asks for a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₇, which is the total sum minus a₀. So that would be (1 - m)^7 - a₀. But a₀ is the constant term, which is when x=0, so (-m)^7. Therefore, the sum a₁ + ... + a₇ is (1 - m)^7 - (-m)^7. But wait, before I proceed, maybe I should check if that's correct. Let me verify with a small example. Suppose we have (x - m)^2 = x² - 2mx + m². Then a₀ = m², a₁ = -2m, a₂ = 1. The sum a₁ + a₂ is -2m + 1. According to the formula, (1 - m)^2 - (-m)^2. Let's compute that: (1 - 2m + m²) - m² = 1 - 2m. Which matches -2m + 1. So that works. So maybe the general formula is correct. Therefore, for part (1), the answer is (1 - m)^7 - (-m)^7. But maybe we need to express this in terms of m or find m first?Wait, the problem says that the coefficient of x⁴ is -35. So first, we need to find the value of m, right? Because the coefficient of x⁴ is given. Once we have m, we can compute the sum. So maybe we need to start by finding m using the given coefficient.Yes, that makes sense. Let's recall that in the expansion of (x - m)^7, the coefficient of x^k is C(7, k) * x^(7 - k) * (-m)^k. Wait, actually, the binomial theorem states that (a + b)^n = Σ_{k=0}^n C(n, k) a^{n - k} b^k. So in this case, (x - m)^7 = Σ_{k=0}^7 C(7, k) x^{7 - k} (-m)^k. Therefore, the coefficient of x^{4} is when 7 - k = 4, so k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient a₄ is C(7, 3) * (-m)^3. But the problem states that this coefficient is -35. Let's compute C(7, 3): 7 choose 3 is 35. So 35 * (-m)^3 = -35. Therefore, (-m)^3 = -35 / 35 = -1. So (-m)^3 = -1 implies that m^3 = 1. Therefore, m = 1. Because if m^3 = 1, real number solutions would be m = 1. Wait, but (-m)^3 = -m^3. Wait, hold on:Wait, let's step back. The coefficient is C(7, 3) * (-m)^3 = 35 * (-m)^3. And this equals -35. So:35 * (-m)^3 = -35Divide both sides by 35:(-m)^3 = -1Which simplifies to:(-m)^3 = -1Take cube roots:-m = -1^(1/3). Since we're dealing with real numbers, the cube root of -1 is -1. Therefore:-m = -1Multiply both sides by -1:m = 1So m is 1. Okay, that's straightforward. So m = 1. Now that we have m, we can compute the sums required.So first, part (1): Find a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₇. As we previously determined, this is (1 - m)^7 - a₀, where a₀ is (-m)^7. Since m = 1, let's compute:(1 - 1)^7 - (-1)^7 = 0^7 - (-1)^7 = 0 - (-1) = 0 + 1 = 1.Wait, so the sum a₁ + ... + a₇ is 1? Let me check with the expansion. If m = 1, then (x - 1)^7. Let's compute (x - 1)^7. The expansion is x^7 - 7x^6 + 21x^5 - 35x^4 + 35x^3 - 21x² + 7x - 1. So the coefficients are:a₀ = -1, a₁ = 7, a₂ = -21, a₃ = 35, a₄ = -35, a₅ = 21, a₆ = -7, a₇ = 1.So summing a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₇: 7 -21 +35 -35 +21 -7 +1. Let's compute step by step:7 -21 = -14-14 +35 = 2121 -35 = -14-14 +21 = 77 -7 = 00 +1 = 1. Yes, that's 1. So the answer to part (1) is 1. That seems correct.Now part (2): Find the value of a₁ + a₃ + a₅ + a₇, which are the odd-indexed coefficients. In the expansion above, the odd indices are a₁, a₃, a₅, a₇. Their coefficients are 7, 35, 21, 1. So adding them up: 7 +35 +21 +1. Let's compute:7 +35 = 4242 +21 = 6363 +1 = 64. So the sum is 64.Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of odd-indexed coefficients without expanding everything. Let me recall that for a polynomial f(x), the sum of coefficients of even degree is [f(1) + f(-1)] / 2, and the sum of coefficients of odd degree is [f(1) - f(-1)] / 2. So here, we need the sum of the odd-indexed coefficients, which would be [f(1) - f(-1)] / 2. Let's check that.Given that f(x) = (x - 1)^7. Then f(1) = (1 -1)^7 = 0. f(-1) = (-1 -1)^7 = (-2)^7 = -128. Then [f(1) - f(-1)] / 2 = [0 - (-128)] / 2 = 128 / 2 = 64. Which matches our previous result. So that works.Therefore, part (2) is 64.But let me confirm once more. Let's list out the coefficients again:a₁ = 7 (x term)a₃ = 35 (x³ term)a₅ = 21 (x⁵ term)a₇ = 1 (x⁷ term)7 +35 +21 +1 = 64. Yep, that's correct.Alternatively, if we didn't have the expansion, using the formula with f(1) and f(-1) gives a quick way. Since we found m = 1, f(x) = (x -1)^7. Therefore, the sum of odd coefficients is [f(1) - f(-1)] / 2 = [0 - (-128)] / 2 = 64.So both methods confirm that the answer is 64.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Use the given coefficient of x⁴ to find m. Since the coefficient of x⁴ is -35, we determined m = 1.2. For part (1), compute the sum of all coefficients from a₁ to a₇ by evaluating (1 - m)^7 - (-m)^7. With m=1, this is 0 - (-1) = 1.3. For part (2), compute the sum of odd-indexed coefficients using the formula [f(1) - f(-1)] / 2, which gives 64.Therefore, the answers should be 1 and 64.Final Answer(1) boxed{1}(2) boxed{64}</think>Given the expansion of ((x - m)^7 = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ldots + a_7 x^7), we know the coefficient of (x^4) is -35. First, we need to find the value of (m). The coefficient of (x^4) in the expansion is given by (binom{7}{3} cdot (-m)^3).

Starting with part (1). The problem says that for 0 < x < 1, we need to prove that (√2 - 1)x + 1 < √(x + 1) < √2. Hmm, so there are two inequalities here: the lower bound and the upper bound. Let me think about each part separately.First, the upper bound: √(x + 1) < √2. Since x is between 0 and 1, x + 1 will be between 1 and 2. The square root function is increasing, so √(x + 1) will be between √1 = 1 and √2. Therefore, √(x + 1) is indeed less than √2 for all x in (0, 1). That seems straightforward. So the upper bound is just using the fact that the square root function is increasing and x + 1 is less than 2 in this interval.Now the lower bound: (√2 - 1)x + 1 < √(x + 1). This is a linear function in x, and we need to show that it's less than √(x + 1) for all x in (0, 1). Let me consider the function f(x) = √(x + 1) - [(√2 - 1)x + 1]. If I can show that f(x) > 0 for all x in (0, 1), then the inequality holds.Let's compute f(0): √(0 + 1) - [(√2 - 1)*0 + 1] = 1 - 1 = 0. Similarly, f(1): √(1 + 1) - [(√2 - 1)*1 + 1] = √2 - (√2 - 1 + 1) = √2 - √2 = 0. So at both endpoints x=0 and x=1, f(x)=0. We need to show that f(x) is positive in between. Maybe f(x) is concave or convex, so the minimum in the interval is positive? Let's check the derivative.Compute f'(x): derivative of √(x + 1) is (1)/(2√(x + 1)), and the derivative of the linear term is (√2 - 1). So f'(x) = 1/(2√(x + 1)) - (√2 - 1). Let's see if this derivative is positive or negative in the interval (0, 1).At x=0, f'(0) = 1/(2√1) - (√2 - 1) = 1/2 - √2 + 1 = 3/2 - √2 ≈ 1.5 - 1.414 ≈ 0.086, which is positive. At x=1, f'(1) = 1/(2√2) - (√2 - 1) ≈ 1/(2*1.414) - 0.414 ≈ 0.353 - 0.414 ≈ -0.061, which is negative. So the derivative starts positive and becomes negative. Therefore, f(x) increases initially and then decreases. Since f(0)=f(1)=0, this suggests that f(x) reaches a maximum somewhere in between and is positive throughout (0,1). Therefore, f(x) > 0 for all x in (0,1), which proves the lower bound.Alternatively, maybe we can square both sides of the inequality to avoid calculus. Let's try that. Starting with (√2 - 1)x + 1 < √(x + 1). Since both sides are positive (because (√2 -1)x +1 is, for x in (0,1): √2 -1 ≈ 0.414, so 0.414x +1 is between 1 and ~1.414, which is positive), squaring should preserve the inequality.So square both sides: [(√2 -1)x +1]^2 < x + 1.Let's compute the left side: [(√2 -1)x +1]^2 = [(√2 -1)x]^2 + 2*(√2 -1)x*1 +1^2 = ( (√2 -1)^2 )x^2 + 2(√2 -1)x + 1.So expand (√2 -1)^2: (√2)^2 - 2√2*1 +1^2 = 2 - 2√2 +1 = 3 - 2√2.Therefore, left side becomes (3 - 2√2)x^2 + 2(√2 -1)x +1.Set the inequality: (3 - 2√2)x^2 + 2(√2 -1)x +1 < x +1.Subtract x +1 from both sides: (3 - 2√2)x^2 + [2(√2 -1) -1]x <0.Compute 2(√2 -1) -1 = 2√2 -2 -1 = 2√2 -3.Therefore, inequality is (3 - 2√2)x^2 + (2√2 -3)x <0.Factor out x: x[(3 - 2√2)x + (2√2 -3)] <0.Since x is in (0,1), x>0, so the sign depends on the second factor: (3 - 2√2)x + (2√2 -3).Let's denote A = 3 - 2√2 ≈ 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, and B = 2√2 -3 ≈ 2.828 -3 ≈ -0.172. So the second factor is Ax + B. Since A is positive and B is negative, and x is between 0 and1, then when x=0, it's B <0, and when x=1, Ax + B = A + B = (3 -2√2) + (2√2 -3) =0. So the linear function Ax + B starts at B negative when x=0 and increases to 0 at x=1. Hence, Ax + B <0 for all x in [0,1). Therefore, the entire expression x(Ax + B) is negative for x in (0,1). Therefore, the original squared inequality holds, which implies the original inequality holds. Hence, the lower bound is proved.So part (1) is done.Now moving on to part (2): Find the limit as a approaches 1 from below of [∫ from a to1 of x√(1 -x²) dx] divided by (1 -a)^(3/2).This is a limit involving an integral near the upper limit of integration, so probably we can use substitution or expand the integral near x=1. The denominator is (1 -a)^(3/2), so the integral must behave like (1 -a)^(3/2) times some constant, and the limit is that constant.First, let me analyze the integral ∫ x√(1 -x²) dx from a to1. Let's compute the integral first. Let's set substitution u =1 -x². Then du = -2x dx, so x dx = -du/2. When x =a, u=1 -a²; when x=1, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=1 -a² to0 of √u * (-du/2). Changing the limits, we get ∫ from 0 to1 -a² of √u * (du/2). Therefore, the integral is (1/2) ∫0^{1 -a²} √u du.Compute the integral: (1/2)*(2/3)u^(3/2) from 0 to1 -a² = (1/3)(1 -a²)^(3/2). Therefore, the integral is (1/3)(1 -a²)^(3/2).Therefore, the numerator is (1/3)(1 -a²)^(3/2), and the denominator is (1 -a)^(3/2). So the expression becomes (1/3)(1 -a²)^(3/2)/(1 -a)^(3/2) = (1/3)[(1 -a²)/(1 -a)]^(3/2). Simplify (1 -a²)/(1 -a) = (1 +a)(1 -a)/(1 -a) =1 +a. Therefore, [1 +a]^(3/2).So the expression becomes (1/3)(1 +a)^(3/2). Now take the limit as a approaches 1 from below. Then 1 +a approaches 2. Therefore, (1 +a)^(3/2) approaches 2^(3/2) = 2*sqrt(2). Therefore, the entire limit is (1/3)*2^(3/2) = (2*sqrt(2))/3.But wait, let me check the steps again.Wait, (1 -a²) = (1 -a)(1 +a), so (1 -a²)/(1 -a) =1 +a. Then [(1 -a²)/(1 -a)]^(3/2) = (1 +a)^(3/2). Therefore, the expression is (1/3)*(1 +a)^(3/2). As a approaches 1-, 1 +a approaches 2. Therefore, the limit is (1/3)*2^(3/2) = (1/3)*(2*sqrt(2)) = (2 sqrt(2))/3. So the answer is 2√2/3. But let me verify this.Alternatively, another way to approach: Let’s denote t =1 -a, so as a approaches1-, t approaches0+. Then the integral becomes ∫ from a=1 -t to1 of x√(1 -x²) dx. Let’s substitute x =1 -y, but maybe better to set x=1 -t + something. Wait, maybe use substitution x=1 -s, so when x=1 -t, s=t, but when x=1, s=0. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, since we already did substitution u=1 -x² earlier and found the integral exactly. But let's see:Alternatively, perhaps expand x√(1 -x²) near x=1. Let x =1 -ε, where ε approaches0. Then 1 -x² =1 - (1 -ε)^2 =1 - (1 -2ε +ε²)=2ε -ε² ≈2ε. So √(1 -x²) ≈√(2ε). Then x≈1, so x√(1 -x²)≈√(2ε). Then integrating from a=1 -t to1 (t is small), so ε from0 tot. Therefore, the integral ≈∫0^t √(2ε) dε =√2*(2/3)t^(3/2). Therefore, the integral ≈ (2√2/3)t^(3/2). Since t=1 -a, then the integral≈(2√2/3)(1 -a)^(3/2). Then dividing by (1 -a)^(3/2), the limit is 2√2/3. Which matches the previous result. So this method also gives the same answer.Therefore, the limit is 2√2/3.So I think that's the answer. Let me check again the integral computation:∫x√(1 -x²)dx from a to1.Let u =1 -x², du= -2xdx => xdx= -du/2. Then integral becomes ∫_{u=1 -a²}^{0} √u*(-du/2) = (1/2)∫0^{1 -a²} √u du= (1/2)*(2/3)u^{3/2} evaluated from0 to1 -a²= (1/3)(1 -a²)^{3/2}. So yes, correct.Therefore, the expression is (1/3)(1 -a²)^{3/2}/(1 -a)^{3/2} = (1/3)( (1 -a)(1 +a) )^{3/2}/(1 -a)^{3/2} )= (1/3)(1 +a)^{3/2}. Then as a→1-, 1 +a→2, so limit is (1/3)(2)^{3/2}= (1/3)(2√2)= 2√2/3. Yes, correct.So the answer is 2√2⁄3, which is boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}.Final Answer(1) boxed{sqrt{2}} and boxed{(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1} are the upper and lower bounds respectively, proven as shown.(2) boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}</think>(1) For (0 < x < 1), we need to prove that ((sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2}).- Upper Bound: Since (0 < x < 1), (x + 1) is between 1 and 2.

Therefore, (sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2}).- Lower Bound: Consider the function (f(x) = sqrt{x + 1} - [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]). We need to show (f(x) > 0) for (0 < x < 1).

Squaring both sides of ((sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1}):  [  [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]^2 < x + 1  ]  Simplifying, we get:  [  (3 - 2sqrt{2})x^2 + (2sqrt{2} - 3)x < 0  ]  Factoring out (x) shows the expression is negative for (0 < x < 1), proving the lower bound.(2) Find (lim_{a rightarrow 1 - 0} frac{int_a^1 xsqrt{1 - x^2}, dx}{(1 - a)^{frac{3}{2}}}).- Substitute (u = 1 - x^2), (du = -2x dx), transforming the integral:  [  int_a^1 xsqrt{1 - x^2}, dx = frac{1}{3}(1 - a^2)^{frac{3}{2}}  ]- The expression becomes:  [  frac{frac{1}{3}(1 - a^2)^{frac{3}{2}}}{(1 - a)^{frac{3}{2}}} = frac{1}{3}(1 + a)^{frac{3}{2}}  ]- As (a rightarrow 1), (1 + a rightarrow 2), giving the limit:  [  frac{1}{3} cdot 2^{frac{3}{2}} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}  ]Final answers:(1) Proved as shown.(2) (boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}),<think>Okay, let me try to work through these problems step by step. Starting with problem (1): For ( 0 < x < 1 ), prove that ( (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2} ).Hmm, so we need to establish two inequalities here. The upper bound seems straightforward because when ( x ) is between 0 and 1, ( x + 1 ) is between 1 and 2, so the square root of that would be between 1 and ( sqrt{2} ). Therefore, ( sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2} ) for all ( x ) in (0,1). But maybe I need to be more rigorous. Let me check.For the upper bound: Since ( x < 1 ), ( x + 1 < 2 ), so ( sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2} ). That's straightforward. So that part is proven.Now the lower bound: ( (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} ). Let me see. Maybe I can square both sides to get rid of the square root, but I have to be careful because squaring inequalities can sometimes be tricky. Let's denote the left-hand side as ( L(x) = (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 ) and the right-hand side as ( R(x) = sqrt{x + 1} ).So we need to show ( L(x) < R(x) ) for ( 0 < x < 1 ). Let's square both sides. Since both sides are positive (since ( sqrt{2} - 1 approx 0.414 ), so even at x=0, L(0) = 1, and x=1, L(1) = sqrt(2)), squaring should preserve the inequality.So ( [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]^2 < x + 1 ).Let me compute the left side:( [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]^2 = [1 + (sqrt{2} - 1)x]^2 ).Expanding this, we get:( 1^2 + 2 times 1 times (sqrt{2} - 1)x + [(sqrt{2} - 1)x]^2 ).Which is:( 1 + 2(sqrt{2} - 1)x + (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 x^2 ).So the inequality becomes:( 1 + 2(sqrt{2} - 1)x + (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 x^2 < x + 1 ).Subtracting ( x + 1 ) from both sides:( 2(sqrt{2} - 1)x + (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 x^2 - x < 0 ).Factor out x:( x [2(sqrt{2} - 1) + (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 x - 1] < 0 ).Let me compute the coefficient terms:First, compute ( 2(sqrt{2} - 1) - 1 ):( 2sqrt{2} - 2 - 1 = 2sqrt{2} - 3 ).Then the term with x is ( (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 ).So the expression inside the brackets is:( (2sqrt{2} - 3) + (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 x ).Hmm, but we need to check if this is negative for all x in (0,1). Let me compute the value at x=0 and x=1.At x=0: The entire expression is 2(sqrt{2} - 1)x + ... - x, which would be 0 - 0 = 0. Wait, but we factored out x, so at x=0, the inequality is 0 < 0, which is not true. But since the original inequality is for 0 < x < 1, not including x=0, maybe that's okay.Wait, when x approaches 0, the left-hand side of the original inequality is L(0) = 1, and R(0) = sqrt(1) = 1. So the inequality is 1 < 1, which is false. But the problem states 0 < x < 1, so maybe x approaching 0 from the right. Let's check the limit as x approaches 0 from the right.Original inequality: ( (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} ). At x approaching 0, both sides approach 1. But we need to see which side is larger. Let's take the derivative of both sides at x=0 to see the behavior near 0.Derivative of L(x): ( (sqrt{2} - 1) ).Derivative of R(x): ( frac{1}{2sqrt{x + 1}} ). At x=0, this is ( frac{1}{2} ).Compare ( (sqrt{2} - 1) approx 0.4142 ) and ( 0.5 ). Since ( 0.4142 < 0.5 ), the left-hand side is increasing slower than the right-hand side near x=0. Therefore, for small x > 0, ( L(x) < R(x) ). But at x=0, they are equal, so just above 0, the inequality holds. Similarly, we need to check at x=1. At x=1, L(1) = ( (sqrt{2} - 1) + 1 = sqrt{2} ), and R(1) = ( sqrt{2} ). So again, they are equal at x=1, but the original inequality is strict. Therefore, maybe the inequality holds for 0 < x < 1, but is equality at x=0 and x=1. However, the problem states 0 < x < 1, so x is not 0 or 1, hence strict inequality.But back to the squared inequality. Let me compute the quadratic expression:Original squared inequality:( [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]^2 < x + 1 )Let me compute the left side minus the right side:( [(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1]^2 - (x + 1) < 0 )Compute that:Expand [ (sqrt(2)-1)x + 1 ]^2 = (sqrt(2)-1)^2 x^2 + 2(sqrt(2)-1)x + 1So subtract (x + 1):= (sqrt(2)-1)^2 x^2 + 2(sqrt(2)-1)x + 1 - x - 1Simplify:= (sqrt(2)-1)^2 x^2 + [2(sqrt(2)-1) - 1]xFactor out x:= x [ (sqrt(2)-1)^2 x + 2(sqrt(2)-1) - 1 ]Let me compute the coefficients:First, (sqrt(2)-1)^2:= (sqrt(2))^2 - 2*sqrt(2)*1 + 1^2= 2 - 2sqrt(2) + 1= 3 - 2sqrt(2)Then, 2(sqrt(2)-1) - 1:= 2sqrt(2) - 2 - 1= 2sqrt(2) - 3So the expression becomes:= x [ (3 - 2sqrt(2))x + (2sqrt(2) - 3) ]Factor the term inside the brackets:= x [ (3 - 2sqrt(2))(x - 1) ]Because (3 - 2sqrt(2))x + (2sqrt(2) - 3) = (3 - 2sqrt(2))x - (3 - 2sqrt(2)) = (3 - 2sqrt(2))(x -1 )Therefore, the expression is:x*(3 - 2sqrt(2))*(x - 1)So we have:x*(3 - 2sqrt(2))*(x - 1) < 0Now, let's check the sign of each factor:For x in (0,1):x > 0(3 - 2sqrt(2)): Compute 3 ≈ 3.0, 2sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828, so 3 - 2.828 ≈ 0.172, which is positive.(x - 1): For x in (0,1), x -1 < 0.Therefore, the product is positive * positive * negative = negative. Hence, the entire expression is negative for x in (0,1), which means the original squared inequality holds. Therefore, since squaring preserved the inequality (both sides positive), the original inequality ( (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} ) holds for 0 < x <1.Thus, problem (1) is proven.Now moving on to problem (2): Find ( lim_{arightarrow 1 - 0} frac{int_a^1 xsqrt{1 - x^2}, dx}{(1 - a)^{frac{3}{2}}} ).So we need to compute the limit as a approaches 1 from below of the integral from a to 1 of x sqrt(1 - x^2) dx divided by (1 - a)^(3/2).This seems like an indeterminate form of 0/0 as a approaches 1, since the integral from a to 1 of x sqrt(1 - x^2) dx will approach 0, and (1 - a)^(3/2) also approaches 0. Therefore, L’Hospital’s Rule might be applicable here, but since the integral is in the numerator, we would need to differentiate the numerator and denominator with respect to a.Recall that by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the derivative of the integral from a to 1 of f(x) dx with respect to a is -f(a). So, d/da [ ∫_a^1 f(x) dx ] = -f(a). Therefore, if we let F(a) = ∫_a^1 x sqrt(1 - x^2) dx, then F’(a) = -a sqrt(1 - a^2). Similarly, the denominator is G(a) = (1 - a)^{3/2}, so G’(a) = (-3/2)(1 - a)^{1/2}.Therefore, applying L’Hospital’s Rule once:Limit becomes [ -a sqrt(1 - a^2) ] / [ (-3/2)(1 - a)^{1/2} ] = [ a sqrt(1 - a^2) ] / [ (3/2)(1 - a)^{1/2} ]Simplify sqrt(1 - a^2) = sqrt((1 - a)(1 + a)) = sqrt(1 - a) sqrt(1 + a). Therefore:Numerator becomes a * sqrt(1 - a) * sqrt(1 + a)Denominator is (3/2) * (1 - a)^{1/2}So overall:[ a * sqrt(1 - a) * sqrt(1 + a) ] / [ (3/2) sqrt(1 - a) ] = [ a sqrt(1 + a) ] / (3/2 ) = (2 a sqrt(1 + a)) / 3Now take the limit as a approaches 1 from below:Plug in a =1: (2 *1 * sqrt(2)) /3 = (2 sqrt(2))/3Therefore, the limit is (2 sqrt(2))/3. But wait, let me check if we can apply L’Hospital once. The original limit after applying L’Hospital once gives us this expression. But when a approaches 1, this expression approaches (2 *1 * sqrt(2))/3, which is finite. Therefore, the original limit is 2 sqrt(2)/3.But let me confirm if applying L’Hospital’s Rule is valid here. The conditions for L’Hospital are that both numerator and denominator approach 0, which they do, and that the derivatives of numerator and denominator exist near a=1 (except possibly at a=1), which they do. Therefore, applying L’Hospital once is valid, and the limit is indeed 2 sqrt(2)/3.Alternatively, maybe we can approach this by substitution to evaluate the integral and then expand it as a approaches 1.Let me try that as a check. Let’s compute the integral ∫_a^1 x sqrt(1 - x^2) dx.Let u = 1 - x^2, then du = -2x dx, so - (1/2) du = x dx.Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{u=a}^{u=0} sqrt(u) * (-1/2) du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{1 - a^2} sqrt(u) du.Wait, no. Wait, when x = a, u = 1 - a^2; when x=1, u=0. So changing the limits:∫_{x=a}^{x=1} x sqrt(1 - x^2) dx = ∫_{u=1 - a^2}^{u=0} sqrt(u) * (-1/(2)) du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{1 - a^2} sqrt(u) du.Compute the integral:(1/2) * [ (2/3) u^{3/2} ] from 0 to 1 - a^2 = (1/2)(2/3)( (1 - a^2)^{3/2} - 0 ) = (1/3)(1 - a^2)^{3/2}.So the integral is (1/3)(1 - a^2)^{3/2}.Therefore, the expression in the limit is:[ (1/3)(1 - a^2)^{3/2} ] / (1 - a)^{3/2} ) = (1/3) [ (1 - a^2)/(1 - a) )^{3/2} ]Simplify 1 - a^2 = (1 - a)(1 + a), so:= (1/3) [ ( (1 - a)(1 + a) ) / (1 - a) )^{3/2} ]Cancel out (1 - a):= (1/3) [ (1 + a) )^{3/2} ]Therefore, the expression simplifies to (1/3)(1 + a)^{3/2}Now take the limit as a approaches 1 from below:= (1/3)(1 + 1)^{3/2} = (1/3)(2)^{3/2} = (1/3)(2*sqrt(2)) = (2 sqrt(2))/3.Which matches the previous result. So that's a good confirmation.Therefore, the limit is (2 sqrt(2))/3.So problem (2) answer is 2√2⁄3.Final Answer(1) boxed{(sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2}} is proved.(2) boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}</think>(1) For ( 0 < x < 1 ), we need to prove that ( (sqrt{2} - 1)x + 1 < sqrt{x + 1} < sqrt{2} ).Upper Bound:Since ( x < 1 ), we have ( x + 1 < 2 ).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, the given equation is (frac{x}{x^{2}+x+1} = a). Maybe I can solve for (x) in terms of (a) and then substitute it into the expression we need to find. But solving for (x) directly might be complicated because it's a quadratic equation. Let me try that anyway.Starting with the given equation:[frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a]Multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of the fraction:[x = a(x^{2} + x + 1)]Expanding the right side:[x = a x^{2} + a x + a]Now, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:[a x^{2} + a x + a - x = 0]Combine like terms:[a x^{2} + (a - 1) x + a = 0]So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of (x):[a x^{2} + (a - 1) x + a = 0]Hmm, solving this quadratic might give expressions for (x) in terms of (a), but that could get messy. Also, since quadratic equations have two solutions, we might end up with two possible values, which complicates things. Maybe there's a smarter way to relate the given expression to the target expression without solving for (x) explicitly.Let me think. The target expression is (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}). The denominator looks like a quadratic in terms of (x^2). Let me check that:(x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2)^2 + x^2 + 1). So, if I let (y = x^2), then the denominator becomes (y^2 + y + 1). But the numerator is (x^2 = y). So, the target expression is (frac{y}{y^2 + y + 1}), which is similar in structure to the original given equation. Wait a second, the original equation was (frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a). The target expression is similar but with (y = x^2) instead of (x). Maybe there's a way to express (y) in terms of (a) using the original equation.Alternatively, notice that (x^4 + x^2 + 1) can be factored. Let me try that. I recall that (x^4 + x^2 + 1) is not a standard factorable form, but perhaps it can be factored as a product of quadratics. Let me check:Suppose (x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + a x + 1)(x^2 + b x + 1)). Let's multiply the right side:[(x^2 + a x + 1)(x^2 + b x + 1) = x^4 + (a + b)x^3 + (ab + 2)x^2 + (a + b)x + 1]Comparing coefficients with (x^4 + x^2 + 1), we get:- Coefficient of (x^3): (a + b = 0)- Coefficient of (x^2): (ab + 2 = 1) → (ab = -1)- Coefficient of (x): (a + b = 0)- Constant term: 1, which matches.From (a + b = 0), we have (b = -a). Substitute into (ab = -1):(a(-a) = -1) → (-a^2 = -1) → (a^2 = 1) → (a = 1) or (a = -1). So, if we take (a = 1) and (b = -1), the factorization is:[(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)]Let me check that:[(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + x^3 - x^2 + x + x^2 - x + 1 = x^4 + x^2 + 1]Yes, that works! So, (x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). Therefore, the denominator of the target expression factors into ((x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). So, we can write the target expression as:[frac{x^2}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}]Now, from the original equation, we know that (frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a). Let's denote (x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}). Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, note that if we have (x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}), but actually, from the original equation:[frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a implies x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}]So, substituting that into the denominator, which has ((x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)), gives:[left( frac{x}{a} right) (x^2 - x + 1)]Therefore, the target expression becomes:[frac{x^2}{left( frac{x}{a} right) (x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{x^2 cdot a}{x (x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}]So now, we have simplified the original target expression to (frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}). Let me denote this as Expression (1).Now, the challenge is to express (frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}) in terms of (a). Let's see if we can relate (x^2 - x + 1) to the original equation.From the original equation, we know that (x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}). Let's solve for (x^2):[x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a} implies x^2 = frac{x}{a} - x - 1 = x left( frac{1}{a} - 1 right) - 1]Alternatively, maybe we can express (x^2 - x + 1) in terms of (x^2 + x + 1):Note that (x^2 - x + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) - 2x). Since (x^2 + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}), substituting gives:[x^2 - x + 1 = frac{x}{a} - 2x = x left( frac{1}{a} - 2 right)]Therefore, substituting back into Expression (1):[frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1} = frac{a x}{x left( frac{1}{a} - 2 right)} = frac{a}{frac{1}{a} - 2}]Simplify the denominator:[frac{1}{a} - 2 = frac{1 - 2a}{a}]Therefore:[frac{a}{frac{1 - 2a}{a}} = frac{a cdot a}{1 - 2a} = frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}]So, according to this, the value of (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4}+x^{2}+1}) is (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}). Let me verify this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the original equation:(frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a), so (x = a(x^2 + x + 1)), leading to the quadratic (a x^2 + (a - 1)x + a = 0). If I solve this quadratic, perhaps I can compute (x^2) in terms of (a), but that might not be necessary here.Alternatively, let's check with a specific value. Let's choose a specific value for (x) and compute (a), then compute the target expression and see if it matches (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}).Take (x = 1). Then:Original equation: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = frac{1}{3} = a). So (a = 1/3).Target expression: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = frac{1}{3}). Now, compute (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a} = frac{(1/3)^2}{1 - 2*(1/3)} = frac{1/9}{1 - 2/3} = frac{1/9}{1/3} = 1/3). Which matches. Good.Another example: Let (x = 2). Then compute (a):Original equation: (frac{2}{4 + 2 + 1} = frac{2}{7} = a). Then target expression should be (frac{4}{16 + 4 + 1} = frac{4}{21}). Now compute (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a} = frac{(4/49)}{1 - 4/7} = frac{4/49}{3/7} = frac{4}{49} * frac{7}{3} = frac{4}{21}). Which matches. Great.One more test case: Let (x = -1). Then original equation: (frac{-1}{1 + (-1) + 1} = frac{-1}{1} = -1 = a). Target expression: (frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = frac{1}{3}). Compute (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a} = frac{1}{1 - (-2)} = frac{1}{3}). Correct again. Hmm, all these examples work, so it seems the answer is indeed (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}). Therefore, the final answer should be (boxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}).Final Answerboxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}</think>Given the equation (frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a) where (a neq 0), we need to find the value of (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}).Starting with the given equation:[frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a]we multiply both sides by the denominator:[x = a(x^{2} + x + 1)]Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:[a x^{2} + (a - 1)x + a = 0]Next, we factor the denominator of the target expression (x^{4} + x^{2} + 1):[x^{4} + x^{2} + 1 = (x^{2} + x + 1)(x^{2} - x + 1)]Using the given equation, we know:[x^{2} + x + 1 = frac{x}{a}]Substituting this into the factored form of the denominator:[x^{4} + x^{2} + 1 = left(frac{x}{a}right)(x^{2} - x + 1)]Thus, the target expression becomes:[frac{x^{2}}{left(frac{x}{a}right)(x^{2} - x + 1)} = frac{x^{2} cdot a}{x (x^{2} - x + 1)} = frac{a x}{x^{2} - x + 1}]We express (x^{2} - x + 1) in terms of (x^{2} + x + 1):[x^{2} - x + 1 = (x^{2} + x + 1) - 2x = frac{x}{a} - 2x = x left(frac{1}{a} - 2right)]Substituting this back into the expression:[frac{a x}{x left(frac{1}{a} - 2right)} = frac{a}{frac{1}{a} - 2} = frac{a}{frac{1 - 2a}{a}} = frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}]Thus, the value of (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}) is:[boxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}],<think>Okay, let's see. I have this problem here: given that (frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a), where (a neq 0), I need to find the value of (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}). Hmm, algebra manipulation, maybe? Let's start by writing down what's given and what's needed.First, the given equation is (frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a). Since (a) is not zero, that means (x) can't be zero either because if (x) were zero, the left side would be 0, which is (a), but (a neq 0). So, (x neq 0). Got that.Now, the expression we need to find is (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}). Hmm, that denominator looks a bit complicated. Let me think about how to simplify that. Maybe we can factor (x^4 + x^2 + 1). Wait, is there a way to factor that? Let me recall. Sometimes, quartics can be factored into quadratics. Let me try.Let me consider (x^4 + x^2 + 1). Maybe it's a quadratic in (x^2). So, (x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2)^2 + x^2 + 1). Hmm, the discriminant here would be (1^2 - 4 times 1 times 1 = 1 - 4 = -3), which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Maybe another approach. Maybe adding and subtracting terms? For example, (x^4 + x^2 + 1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 - x^2 = (x^2 + 1)^2 - x^2 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). Oh, that works! Yes, because it's a difference of squares. So, (x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). Nice, that's helpful.So, the denominator of the expression we need to find factors into ((x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). That seems useful because the given equation involves (x^2 + x + 1). Let me note that.So, (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1} = frac{x^2}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}). So, maybe we can express this in terms of (a)? Since we already have (x/(x^2 + x + 1) = a), perhaps we can find expressions for (x^2 + x + 1) and (x^2 - x + 1) in terms of (a).Let me start by solving the given equation for (x) in terms of (a), maybe? Let's see. From (frac{x}{x^{2} + x + 1} = a), we can rearrange this. Multiply both sides by (x^2 + x + 1):(x = a(x^2 + x + 1))Expanding the right side:(x = a x^2 + a x + a)Bring all terms to one side:(a x^2 + a x + a - x = 0)Combine like terms:(a x^2 + (a - 1) x + a = 0)So, that's a quadratic in (x): (a x^2 + (a - 1) x + a = 0). Hmm. Maybe solving for (x) is not the most straightforward path here. Alternatively, perhaps we can express (x^2) in terms of (x) and (a), using the given equation.Let's see. Starting from (x = a(x^2 + x + 1)), we can solve for (x^2):Divide both sides by (a) (since (a neq 0)):(x/a = x^2 + x + 1)Then, rearrange:(x^2 = x/a - x - 1)Factor the right side:(x^2 = x(1/a - 1) - 1)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express (x^2) in terms of (x). Let's see:From the equation (a x^2 + (a - 1) x + a = 0), solve for (x^2):(a x^2 = -(a - 1)x - a)Divide both sides by (a):(x^2 = -frac{(a - 1)}{a} x - 1)So, (x^2) is expressed as (- frac{(a - 1)}{a} x - 1). Maybe that's useful for substitution into the expression we need to find.Alternatively, let's look at the expression we need: (frac{x^2}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}). Since we have (x^2 + x + 1) in the denominator, which is related to (a), as (x/(x^2 + x + 1) = a), so (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a). Let me note that.So, substitute (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a) into the denominator:So, denominator becomes ((x/a)(x^2 - x + 1)). Therefore, the expression becomes:(frac{x^2}{(x/a)(x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{x^2 cdot a}{x (x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}).So, we have (frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}). Now, we need to express this in terms of (a). So, perhaps find an expression for (x^2 - x + 1) in terms of (a)?Alternatively, notice that (x^2 - x + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) - 2x). Since (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a), then:(x^2 - x + 1 = x/a - 2x = x(1/a - 2)).So, substituting back into the expression:(frac{a x}{x(1/a - 2)} = frac{a}{1/a - 2} = frac{a}{(1 - 2a)/a} = frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}).Wait, that seems promising. Let me check that step again.Starting from (x^2 - x + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) - 2x). Since (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a), substituting:(x^2 - x + 1 = (x/a) - 2x = x(1/a - 2)). Then, in the expression (frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}), substitute the denominator:(frac{a x}{x(1/a - 2)} = frac{a}{1/a - 2}). Then, simplifying the denominator:(1/a - 2 = (1 - 2a)/a), so the entire expression becomes:(a div frac{1 - 2a}{a} = a times frac{a}{1 - 2a} = frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}).Therefore, the value of (frac{x^{2}}{x^{4} + x^{2} + 1}) is (frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}). Let me verify if that's correct.Wait, let's double-check each step to make sure there's no mistake.First, the given equation: (frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a). So, (x = a(x^2 + x + 1)). Then, solving for (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a). Correct.Then, the expression to find is (frac{x^2}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}). We substituted (x^2 + x + 1 = x/a), so the denominator becomes (x/a times (x^2 - x + 1)). Then, the expression becomes (frac{x^2}{(x/a)(x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{x^2 cdot a}{x (x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}). Then, we note that (x^2 - x + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) - 2x = x/a - 2x = x(1/a - 2)). Then, substitute that into the denominator: (frac{a x}{x(1/a - 2)} = frac{a}{1/a - 2}). Then, simplifying (1/a - 2 = (1 - 2a)/a), so invert and multiply: (a times frac{a}{1 - 2a} = a^2 / (1 - 2a)). That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe plug in a specific value of (x) to test. Let's pick a value for (x) and compute (a), then compute the original expression and see if it equals (a^2 / (1 - 2a)).Let's take (x = 1). Then, compute (a):(a = frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = 1/3).Now, compute the expression (frac{1^2}{1^4 + 1^2 + 1} = frac{1}{1 + 1 + 1} = 1/3).Now, compute (a^2 / (1 - 2a)) with (a = 1/3):((1/3)^2 / (1 - 2*(1/3)) = (1/9) / (1 - 2/3) = (1/9) / (1/3) = (1/9) * 3 = 1/3). Which matches. Good.Let's try another value. Let me pick (x = 2). Then, compute (a = 2/(4 + 2 + 1) = 2/7.Compute the expression: (x^2 / (x^4 + x^2 + 1) = 4 / (16 + 4 + 1) = 4/21).Now compute (a^2 / (1 - 2a) = (4/49) / (1 - 4/7) = (4/49) / (3/7) = (4/49) * (7/3) = 28/147 = 4/21. Correct again.Another test: (x = -1). Then, (a = (-1)/(1 -1 +1) = (-1)/1 = -1.Compute the expression: ((-1)^2 / (1 + 1 +1) = 1/3).Now compute (a^2 / (1 - 2a) = (1) / (1 - 2*(-1)) = 1/(1 + 2) = 1/3. Correct again.Alright, seems like the formula holds. So, the answer is (a^2 / (1 - 2a)). Therefore, boxed, it's (boxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}).Final Answerboxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}</think>Given the equation (frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a) where (a neq 0), we need to find the value of (frac{x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}).First, we start by noting that the denominator (x^4 + x^2 + 1) can be factored as ((x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)). This allows us to rewrite the expression we need to find as:[frac{x^2}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}]From the given equation (frac{x}{x^2 + x + 1} = a), we can express (x^2 + x + 1) as (frac{x}{a}). Substituting this into the denominator, we get:[frac{x^2}{left(frac{x}{a}right)(x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{x^2 cdot a}{x (x^2 - x + 1)} = frac{a x}{x^2 - x + 1}]Next, we need to express (x^2 - x + 1) in terms of (a). We know that:[x^2 - x + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1) - 2x = frac{x}{a} - 2x = x left(frac{1}{a} - 2right)]Substituting this back into our expression, we have:[frac{a x}{x left(frac{1}{a} - 2right)} = frac{a}{frac{1}{a} - 2} = frac{a}{frac{1 - 2a}{a}} = frac{a^2}{1 - 2a}]Thus, the value of (frac{x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}) is (boxed{dfrac{a^2}{1 - 2a}}).]"},{"problem":"Task 5. Determine all pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p^{2}+5 p q+4 q^{2} is the square of an integer.","solution":"Solution. Write p^{2}+5 p q+4 q^{2}=a^{2}, with a geq 0 an integer. The left side is equal to (p+2 q)^{2}+p q, so we can rewrite this as p q=a^{2}-(p+2 q)^{2}, or p q=(a-p-2 q)(a+p+2 q). The second factor on the right is greater than p and greater than q, but it is a divisor of p q. Since p and q are prime, it must be equal to p q, so a+p+2 q=p q. And then a-p-2 q=1. Subtract these two: p q-1=(a+p+2 q)-(a-p-2 q)=2(p+2 q), or p q-2 p-4 q-1=0. This can be rewritten as (p-4)(q-2)=9. The factor q-2 cannot be negative, so p-4 cannot be negative either. The factors must therefore be equal to 1 and 9 or 9 and 1 or 3 and 3. This gives for (p, q) the possibilities (5,11),(13,3) and (7,5). Checking shows that p^{2}+5 p q+4 q^{2} is a square in each of these cases, namely 28^{2}, 20^{2} and 18^{2}. So these three pairs are the solutions.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to find all pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that the expression p² + 5pq + 4q² is a perfect square. Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, let's write down the expression: p² + 5pq + 4q². Maybe I can factor this expression to see if it simplifies or gives any clues. Let me try factoring:Looking at p² + 5pq + 4q², I notice that it's a quadratic in terms of p and q. Let me see if it factors into two binomials. Let's consider coefficients:The coefficient of p² is 1, so the factors would start as (p + a q)(p + b q). Multiplying these out gives p² + (a + b)pq + ab q². Comparing with the original expression, we have:a + b = 5 and ab = 4.So, we need two numbers a and b such that their sum is 5 and product is 4. Let's solve these equations. The factors of 4 are 1 and 4, 2 and 2. Since 1 + 4 = 5, that works. So a and b are 1 and 4. Therefore, the expression factors as:(p + q)(p + 4q).So, p² + 5pq + 4q² = (p + q)(p + 4q). Now, the problem states that this product is a perfect square. Therefore, (p + q)(p + 4q) must be a square of an integer.Since p and q are primes, let's recall that primes are integers greater than 1, so p and q are at least 2. Let me note that primes except 2 are odd, and 2 is the only even prime. So, if either p or q is 2, that might affect the parity (evenness or oddness) of p + q and p + 4q.First, let's note that if both p and q are odd primes, then p and q are odd. Then p + q would be even (since odd + odd = even), and p + 4q would be odd + even = odd. So (p + q) is even and (p + 4q) is odd. So their product is even * odd = even. For this product to be a perfect square, the even number must be a multiple of 4, because in a square, every prime factor has an even exponent. So if 2 divides the product, since (p + q) is even and (p + 4q) is odd, the factor of 2 must come entirely from (p + q). Therefore, (p + q) must be a multiple of 4, and (p + 4q) must be an odd square. Alternatively, if (p + q) is twice a square and (p + 4q) is twice a square as well, but since (p + 4q) is odd, that can't be. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, since the product (p + q)(p + 4q) is a square, the two factors (p + q) and (p + 4q) must themselves be squares or multiples of squares such that their product is a square. However, since they are coprime or share a common factor, we need to check their greatest common divisor (gcd).Let me compute gcd(p + q, p + 4q). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm:gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = gcd(p + q, (p + 4q) - (p + q)) = gcd(p + q, 3q).Similarly, gcd(p + q, 3q). Since p and q are primes, if p ≠ q, then gcd(p, q) = 1. If p = q, then gcd(p, q) = p. But primes p and q could be equal. Let's consider two cases: p = q and p ≠ q.Case 1: p = q. Then the expression becomes p² + 5p² + 4p² = 10p². But 10p² must be a perfect square. 10 is not a perfect square, so this would require p² to be a multiple of 10. However, p is prime, so p² can only have prime factors of p. Since 10 is 2*5, p must be both 2 and 5, which is impossible. Therefore, p cannot equal q. So we can assume p ≠ q.Therefore, gcd(p + q, 3q) = gcd(p + q, 3). Because since p and q are distinct primes, and p ≠ q, then gcd(p + q, q) divides (p + q) - q = p, but gcd(p, q) = 1, so gcd(p + q, q) = 1. Similarly, gcd(p + q, 3) is either 1 or 3.Therefore, the gcd of (p + q) and (p + 4q) is either 1 or 3. Since their product is a square, each of them must be a square times their gcd. Wait, more formally, if two numbers multiply to a square, and their gcd is d, then each number is d times a square. Let me recall that.Yes, if ab = k² and gcd(a, b) = d, then a = d m² and b = d n² where gcd(m, n) = 1. Then d² m² n² = k², so k = d m n. Therefore, in our case, since (p + q)(p + 4q) is a square, and gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = d, which is either 1 or 3, then we have two possibilities:1. If d = 1, then (p + q) and (p + 4q) are both perfect squares.2. If d = 3, then (p + q) = 3 m² and (p + 4q) = 3 n², where m and n are coprime integers.So we need to explore both possibilities.First, let's check the case where d = 1. Then both (p + q) and (p + 4q) are perfect squares. Let’s denote:p + q = a²p + 4q = b²Where a and b are positive integers. Then subtracting the first equation from the second:(p + 4q) - (p + q) = b² - a²3q = (b - a)(b + a)So, 3q is equal to (b - a)(b + a). Since q is a prime, and 3 is also a prime, the right-hand side must be a factorization of 3q. So, possible factor pairs of 3q are (1, 3q), (3, q). Since b > a (because p + 4q > p + q, so b² > a², so b > a), we can write:Case 1a: b - a = 1 and b + a = 3qCase 1b: b - a = 3 and b + a = qBut let's check if these are possible. Let's first check Case 1a:Case 1a: b - a = 1 and b + a = 3qAdding these two equations: 2b = 1 + 3q ⇒ b = (1 + 3q)/2Subtracting: 2a = 3q - 1 ⇒ a = (3q - 1)/2Since a and b must be integers, (1 + 3q) and (3q - 1) must both be even. Since 3q is either odd or even depending on q. Since q is a prime, if q = 2, then 3q = 6, which is even, so 1 + 6 = 7, which is odd, not divisible by 2. So (1 + 3q)/2 would not be integer. If q is odd (all primes except 2), then 3q is odd, so 1 + 3q is even, and 3q - 1 is even. Therefore, in this case, for q odd, a and b would be integers.But let's check if q = 2 is possible here. If q = 2, then:From Case 1a: b = (1 + 6)/2 = 7/2, which is 3.5, not integer. So q=2 is invalid here.Similarly, if we consider Case 1b: b - a = 3 and b + a = qAdding: 2b = 3 + q ⇒ b = (3 + q)/2Subtracting: 2a = q - 3 ⇒ a = (q - 3)/2Again, a and b must be integers, so q must be odd (as primes except 2 are odd). Then q - 3 must be even, so q must be 3 mod 4? Wait, q is a prime. Let's check q=3:Then a = (3 - 3)/2 = 0, which is invalid since a must be a positive integer. So q must be at least 5. Let's try q=5:a=(5 - 3)/2=1, b=(3 +5)/2=4. Then we have:p + q = a² =1 ⇒ p +5=1 ⇒ p= -4, invalid.Similarly, q=7:a=(7-3)/2=2, b=(3+7)/2=5. Then p +7=4 ⇒ p=-3, invalid.Wait, this seems problematic. So in Case 1b, the equations give negative p for primes q ≥5. Therefore, this case cannot hold. Therefore, Case 1b is invalid for primes q ≥3. If q=2, then b = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5, non-integer, so invalid. Therefore, Case 1b does not yield valid solutions. Therefore, only Case 1a might give solutions when q is odd (q ≥3).So returning to Case 1a where q is an odd prime:We have p + q = a² and p + 4q = b². From above, a=(3q -1)/2, b=(3q +1)/2.Therefore, substituting into p + q = a²:p + q = [(3q -1)/2]^2Similarly, p = [(3q -1)/2]^2 - qLet me compute that:p = (9q² -6q +1)/4 - q = (9q² -6q +1 -4q)/4 = (9q² -10q +1)/4Since p must be a prime number, and positive integer, so (9q² -10q +1) must be divisible by 4, and the result must be a prime.Let me check divisibility by 4. Let’s compute 9q² -10q +1 modulo 4. Since q is an odd prime greater than 2, q is odd, so q is 1 or 3 modulo 4.Case 1a1: q ≡1 mod4Then q=4k+1. Let's compute 9q² -10q +1 mod4:q ≡1: q²≡1, 9*1=9≡1 mod410q ≡10*1=10≡2 mod4Thus, 1 -2 +1=0 mod4. Therefore, divisible by 4.Case 1a2: q≡3 mod4q=4k+3. Then q²=(4k+3)^2=16k²+24k+9≡1 mod4So again, 9q²≡1 mod410q≡10*3=30≡2 mod4Thus, 1 -2 +1=0 mod4. So regardless of q being 1 or 3 mod4, 9q² -10q +1 is divisible by4. Therefore, p=(9q² -10q +1)/4 is an integer.Now, we need to check if this p is a prime.Let’s test this with small odd primes q.Start with q=3:p=(9*9 -10*3 +1)/4=(81-30+1)/4=52/4=13. 13 is prime. So (p,q)=(13,3) is a possible pair.Check the original expression: 13² +5*13*3 +4*3² = 169 + 195 + 36= 169+195=364, 364+36=400=20². Correct.Next, q=5:p=(9*25 -10*5 +1)/4=(225 -50 +1)/4=176/4=44. 44 is not prime. So discard.q=7:p=(9*49 -10*7 +1)/4=(441 -70 +1)/4=372/4=93. 93 is not prime (divisible by 3). Discard.q=11:p=(9*121 -10*11 +1)/4=(1089 -110 +1)/4=980/4=245. 245=5*49=5*7². Not prime.q=13:p=(9*169 -10*13 +1)/4=(1521 -130 +1)/4=1392/4=348. Not prime.q=17:p=(9*289 -10*17 +1)/4=(2601 -170 +1)/4=2432/4=608. Not prime.q=2: Not odd, but let's check:Wait, q=2 was excluded earlier because in Case1a, when q=2, a=(3*2 -1)/2=5/2=2.5, which isn't integer, so invalid.So only q=3 gives p=13 which is prime. Let me check q=7 again:Wait, q=7 gives p=93, which is 93 divided by 3 is 31. So 93=3*31. Not prime.Hmm. So in this Case1a, only q=3 gives a prime p. Let me check q=19:p=(9*361 -10*19 +1)/4=(3249 -190 +1)/4=3060/4=765. 765 is divisible by 5 (ends with 5). 765=5*153=5*9*17. Not prime.So seems like only q=3 gives prime p=13. Therefore, (13,3) is a solution.Now, let's check the other case where gcd(p + q, p +4q)=3. So d=3. Then (p + q)=3m² and (p +4q)=3n² where gcd(m,n)=1.Therefore, similar to before, subtracting the two equations:(p +4q) - (p +q) =3n² -3m²3q=3(n² -m²)Divide both sides by 3:q= n² -m²= (n -m)(n +m)Since q is a prime, the factorization (n -m)(n +m) must equal q. Since q is prime, the only possible factorizations are 1*q. Therefore, we must have:n - m =1 and n + m = qAdding these equations: 2n = q +1 ⇒ n=(q +1)/2Subtracting: 2m = q -1 ⇒ m=(q -1)/2Since n and m must be integers, q must be odd (since q is a prime greater than 2, except q=2). But let's check if q=2:If q=2, then n=(2 +1)/2=1.5, non-integer. So q must be odd. So q is an odd prime.Thus, for each odd prime q, we can define m and n as above. Then:From p + q=3m²:p=3m² - qBut m=(q -1)/2, so:p=3[(q -1)/2]^2 - qLet me compute that:p=3*(q² -2q +1)/4 - q= (3q² -6q +3 -4q)/4= (3q² -10q +3)/4Again, p must be a prime, so check if this expression yields a prime for odd primes q.Again, check divisibility by4:Compute 3q² -10q +3 mod4. Since q is odd, q=1 or3 mod4.Case2a: q≡1 mod43*1 -10*1 +3=3-10+3=-4≡0 mod4. So divisible by4.Case2b: q≡3 mod43*9 -10*3 +3=27-30+3=0≡0 mod4. So in both cases, divisible by4. Therefore, p=(3q² -10q +3)/4 is integer.Now, check for small primes q:q=3:p=(3*9 -10*3 +3)/4=(27-30+3)/4=0/4=0. Not prime. Disregard.q=5:p=(3*25 -10*5 +3)/4=(75 -50 +3)/4=28/4=7. 7 is prime. So (p,q)=(7,5).Check the original expression:7² +5*7*5 +4*25=49 +175 +100=324=18². Correct.q=7:p=(3*49 -10*7 +3)/4=(147 -70 +3)/4=80/4=20. 20 not prime.q=11:p=(3*121 -10*11 +3)/4=(363 -110 +3)/4=256/4=64. Not prime.q=13:p=(3*169 -10*13 +3)/4=(507 -130 +3)/4=380/4=95. 95=5*19. Not prime.q=17:p=(3*289 -10*17 +3)/4=(867 -170 +3)/4=700/4=175. Not prime.q=19:p=(3*361 -10*19 +3)/4=(1083 -190 +3)/4=896/4=224. Not prime.q=23:p=(3*529 -10*23 +3)/4=(1587 -230 +3)/4=1360/4=340. Not prime.So only q=5 gives p=7, which is prime. Thus, (7,5) is another solution.Now, check q=2 in this case:From the equations, n=(2 +1)/2=1.5, which is not integer. So invalid.So under case2, only q=5 gives p=7. So (7,5) is a solution.Now, let's check other possibilities. Wait, are there other possible gcds? Earlier, we considered gcd(p + q, p +4q)=1 or3. Wait, let's verify that.Earlier, using the Euclidean algorithm, we had:gcd(p + q, p +4q)=gcd(p + q,3q). Then since gcd(p + q, q)=gcd(p, q)=1 (since p≠q and primes), so gcd(p + q,3q)=gcd(p + q,3). Therefore, the gcd is either1 or3. Thus, our initial analysis holds.Therefore, the only possible cases are d=1 and d=3, leading to two solutions (13,3) and (7,5). Wait, but hold on. When q=3 and p=13, and q=5 and p=7. Let's check if there are more solutions. Wait, maybe q=2?Wait, earlier, when we considered d=1, the Case1a when q=2 gives a non-integer a and b, but maybe q=2 in the other case?Wait, let's see. Let me check q=2 in the original expression. Let’s compute p² +5p*2 +4*2² = p² +10p +16. We need this to be a square.So, p² +10p +16 =k². Let's try small primes p.p=2: 4 +20 +16=40. Not a square.p=3:9 +30 +16=55. Not a square.p=5:25 +50 +16=91. Not a square.p=7:49 +70 +16=135. Not a square.p=11:121 +110 +16=247. Not a square.p=13:169 +130 +16=315. Not a square.p=17:289 +170 +16=475. Not a square.p=19:361 +190 +16=567. Not a square.So seems like q=2 does not yield any solutions. Therefore, if either p or q is 2, does the equation hold?Wait, maybe p=2 and q is another prime. Let me check p=2:Expression:2² +5*2*q +4q²=4 +10q +4q². Let's set this equal to k².4q² +10q +4=k².Maybe factor this as well? Let's see:4q² +10q +4. Let me factor:This quadratic in q: discriminant=100 -4*4*4=100-64=36. So roots are [-10 ±6]/8.Thus, factors would be (2q + a)(2q + b). Let's check:(2q + a)(2q + b)=4q² + (a + b)2q +ab. Comparing to 4q² +10q +4:So, 2(a + b)=10 ⇒a + b=5, ab=4. As before, a=1, b=4. Therefore, factors are (2q +1)(2q +4)= (2q +1)*2(q +2). Therefore, 2(2q +1)(q +2). So 2*(2q +1)*(q +2)=k².So, 2*(2q +1)*(q +2) is a square. Again, primes q.Since q is a prime, let's see possible values. Let's check small primes q.q=2: 2*(5)*(4)=2*5*4=40. Not a square.q=3:2*(7)*(5)=2*7*5=70. Not a square.q=5:2*(11)*(7)=2*11*7=154. Not a square.q=7:2*(15)*(9)=2*15*9=270. Not a square.q=11:2*(23)*(13)=2*23*13=598. Not a square.q=13:2*(27)*(15)=2*27*15=810. Not a square.None of these are squares. So p=2 does not yield any solution. Similarly, q=2 does not work with p=2 either. So q=2 seems invalid.Therefore, the only solutions we found so far are (13,3) and (7,5). Let me verify these again:For (13,3):13² +5*13*3 +4*3²=169 +195 +36=400=20². Correct.For (7,5):7² +5*7*5 +4*5²=49 +175 +100=324=18². Correct.Are there any other primes q where either case1a or case2 could give prime p?In case1a: For q=3 gives p=13, which works. q=5 gives p=44, not prime. q=7 gives p=93, not prime. q=11 gives p=245, not prime. So seems like only q=3.In case2: q=5 gives p=7, which works. q=3 gives p=0, invalid. q=7 gives p=20, invalid. Similarly, higher primes give non-prime p. So only q=5.Therefore, the only pairs are (13,3) and (7,5). But wait, primes can be ordered pairs, so (3,13) and (5,7) as well? Wait, but in our cases, when q=3, p=13; when q=5, p=7. So the pairs are (13,3) and (7,5). If we consider the original problem says \\"all pairs of prime numbers (p,q)\\", so ordered pairs? Or unordered?But in the problem statement, it's written as pairs (p,q), which typically are ordered, but since the equation is symmetric in p and q? Wait, no, the equation is not symmetric. Let's check.Wait, the expression is p² +5pq +4q². If we swap p and q, it becomes q² +5pq +4p² =4p² +5pq +q², which is not the same as original. So the equation is not symmetric in p and q. Therefore, (p,q) and (q,p) are different pairs unless p=q, which we already saw is impossible. Therefore, (13,3) and (3,13) are different pairs. Let me check if (3,13) is a solution.Let’s compute 3² +5*3*13 +4*13²=9 +195 + 676=9+195=204; 204+676=880. Is 880 a square? 29²=841, 30²=900. No, so 880 is not a square. Therefore, (3,13) is not a solution. Similarly, (5,7):5² +5*5*7 +4*7²=25 +175 +196=25+175=200; 200+196=396. 396 is not a square (19²=361, 20²=400). So only (13,3) and (7,5) are solutions.But wait, in case1a when we set q=3, p=13. If I set q=13, would that lead us to a possible p? Let's check.Wait, in case1a, for q=13, we would compute p=(9*(13)^2 -10*13 +1)/4=(1521 -130 +1)/4=(1392)/4=348, which is not prime. Similarly, q=7 gives p=93. So no.Therefore, the only valid pairs are (13,3) and (7,5).But let me check another angle. Let's suppose that the original expression (p + q)(p +4q) is a square. So if both factors are squares, or one is a square and the other is a multiple of a square. But as they share a gcd of 1 or3. So if gcd is1, both squares. If gcd is3, then each is 3 times a square.Alternatively, maybe there are other primes where these equations hold. Wait, but I think we checked all possibilities. Let me think of another approach.Alternatively, suppose that (p + q)(p +4q) is a square. Let’s denote x = p + q and y = p +4q. Then y -x =3q, so y =x +3q. But since x =p +q, then y =p +q +3q= p +4q, which is consistent.But we can also express p =x -q. Then y =x -q +4q =x +3q. So substituting into y =x +3q. So we have x*y = square. So x*(x +3q)=square. But x =p +q, and p =x -q. So maybe this approach is not helpful.Alternatively, set variables to express in terms of q. Let me think.Alternatively, note that (p + q)(p +4q)=k². Let’s set k=m. Then (p + q)(p +4q)=m². Let me think of this as a quadratic equation in p:p² +5pq +4q² -m²=0.Using quadratic formula for p:p = [-5q ±√(25q² -4*(1)*(4q² -m²))]/2= [-5q ±√(25q² -16q² +4m²)]/2= [-5q ±√(9q² +4m²)]/2Since p must be a positive integer, discriminant must be a perfect square and the numerator must yield a positive integer.So 9q² +4m² must be a perfect square. Let’s denote 9q² +4m² =n², where n is integer.Therefore, we have the equation n² -4m²=9q².This can be written as (n -2m)(n +2m)=9q².Since n and m are positive integers, n >2m. Therefore, the factors (n -2m) and (n +2m) are positive integers that multiply to9q². Also, since n -2m and n +2m have the same parity (both even or both odd). Let's check:n -2m and n +2m. Adding them:2n must be even, so n is integer, so both factors are both even or both odd. However, their product is9q², which is 9 times a square. Since 9 is 3², then 9q²=(3q)². So, the equation becomes (n -2m)(n +2m)=(3q)².Therefore, the two factors (n -2m) and (n +2m) must be divisors of (3q)², and both factors must satisfy that their product is (3q)^2 and their difference is 4m.So, possible factor pairs of (3q)^2 are:1*(9q²), 3*(3q²), 9*(q²), q*(9q), 3q*(3q)But since n -2m <n +2m, and their product is9q², let's list all possible pairs (d, e) such that d*e=9q² and d <=e, and e -d=4m.Also, since n -2m and n +2m have the same parity, and their product is9q², which is odd only if q is odd (since 9 is odd, q² is odd if q is odd). If q=2, then 9q²=36, which is even.But q is prime, so possible q=2 or odd primes. Let's check both.Case A: q is odd (q ≠2):Then 9q² is odd. Therefore, the factors d and e must be odd. So possible factor pairs (d,e):1*9q², 9*q², 3*3q², q²*9, 3q*3q.But wait, 9q² can be factored as:1 and9q²3 and3q²9 andq²3q and3qq and9qBut q is a prime. So depending on q, some factors may not exist. Since q is prime, the factors of9q² are1,3,9,q,3q,9q,q²,3q²,9q².Therefore, the factor pairs are:(1,9q²), (3,3q²), (9,q²), (q,9q), (3q,3q)But let's check which of these pairs have the same parity. Since q is odd, 9q² is odd, so all factors d and e are odd. Therefore, their difference e -d=4m must be divisible by4. Let's check each pair:1. (1,9q²):Difference:9q² -1=4m. So m=(9q² -1)/4But then, from n -2m=1 andn +2m=9q². Adding:2n=9q² +1 ⇒n=(9q² +1)/2Subtracting:4m=9q² -1 ⇒m=(9q² -1)/4Since q is odd, q²≡1 mod4, so 9q²≡9*1=9≡1 mod4. Therefore, 9q² -1≡0 mod4, so m is integer.Similarly, n=(9q² +1)/2. Since 9q² is odd, 9q² +1 is even, so n is integer.Then, p is computed from quadratic formula:p = [-5q ±n]/2. Since p must be positive, take the positive root:p = (-5q +n)/2 = (-5q + (9q² +1)/2)/2 = (-10q +9q² +1)/4=(9q² -10q +1)/4Wait, this is the same expression as in Case1a. So we end up with the same p. Therefore, this approach leads back to our previous analysis, which only gave solution q=3, p=13.Similarly, let's check another pair:2. (3,3q²):Difference:3q² -3=4m ⇒m=(3q² -3)/4From n -2m=3 andn +2m=3q². Adding:2n=3q² +3 ⇒n=(3q² +3)/2Subtracting:4m=3q² -3 ⇒m=(3q² -3)/4Then, compute p:p=(-5q +n)/2=(-5q + (3q² +3)/2)/2=(-10q +3q² +3)/4=(3q² -10q +3)/4Which is the same as in case2. Therefore, this gives the same expression for p, which gave solution q=5, p=7.3. (9,q²):Difference:q² -9=4m ⇒m=(q² -9)/4From n -2m=9 andn +2m=q². Adding:2n=q² +9 ⇒n=(q² +9)/2Subtracting:4m=q² -9 ⇒m=(q² -9)/4Then, compute p:p=(-5q +n)/2=(-5q + (q² +9)/2)/2=(-10q +q² +9)/4=(q² -10q +9)/4So p=(q² -10q +9)/4. Let's check if this gives primes.For q odd primes:q=3:p=(9 -30 +9)/4=(-12)/4=-3. Invalid.q=5:p=(25 -50 +9)/4=(-16)/4=-4. Invalid.q=7:p=(49 -70 +9)/4=(-12)/4=-3. Invalid.q=11:p=(121 -110 +9)/4=20/4=5. Prime.So q=11 gives p=5. Wait, let's check:q=11, p=5. But p=5 is prime. Let's check the original expression:5² +5*5*11 +4*11²=25 +275 + 484=784=28². Correct.Wait, so this seems a new solution: (5,11). But in our previous analysis, we didn't encounter this. So why?Ah, because we considered case1 and case2, but maybe there are other factor pairs. Wait, in this case, we considered the pair (9,q²). So this gives another solution.Wait, but why didn't this show up in our earlier cases? Because when we split the product into (p + q)(p +4q) and considered gcd as1 or3, but this approach with the quadratic formula gives another solution. Therefore, perhaps there's another case where the factors are9 and q², leading to a solution (5,11).Therefore, we need to check this.So with q=11, p=5. Let's verify:5² +5*5*11 +4*(11)²=25 +275 +484=784=28². Correct.Therefore, (5,11) is another solution.Wait, so why didn't this appear in our previous analysis? Because in our previous approach, we considered gcd(p + q, p +4q)=d, which can be1 or3, but here, this solution arises from a different factor pair. Therefore, perhaps our initial approach missed this case.So, let's reconcile this. Let's see:If (p + q)(p +4q) is a square, we factored it as such, and considered the cases when gcd(p + q, p +4q) is1 or3. However, when the factors are9 and q², which are not coprime if q is3, but for other q, they may be coprime?Wait, for q=11, p=5. Then p + q=16, p +4q=5 +44=49. So (16,49). gcd(16,49)=1. Therefore, they are coprime. However, in our previous cases, we had two possibilities when gcd is1 or3. But here, gcd=1, and their product is16*49=784=28², which is a square. So according to our previous analysis, when gcd=1, both factors should be squares. But 16=4² and49=7², so yes, they are squares. Therefore, this would have been covered in case1 when d=1, where both p + q and p +4q are squares. Therefore, in our previous case1, when we set p + q=a² and p +4q=b², leading to q=(b -a)(b +a)/3, this solution corresponds to a=4, b=7. Let's check:From p + q=16=4², p +4q=49=7². Then:b -a=3, which is the difference between7 and4.From our previous equations:3q=(b -a)(b +a)=3*(7 +4)=3*11=33. Therefore, q=11. Then p=16 -11=5. So this solution is indeed covered in case1a, where a=4, b=7. But when we checked q=11 in case1a earlier, we computed p=(9*11² -10*11 +1)/4=(1089 -110 +1)/4=980/4=245, which is not prime. Wait, that contradicts. What's happening here?Wait, when we considered case1a, which corresponds to the factor pair (1,3q), we obtained p=(9q² -10q +1)/4. However, in this new solution (5,11), p + q=16=4² and p +4q=49=7². So in this case, it's a different factor pair where p + q and p +4q are squares. But according to case1a, when gcd=1, we solved for q=(b -a)(b +a)/3. In this case, a=4, b=7, so 3q=(7 -4)(7 +4)=3*11 ⇒q=11. Then p=a² - q=16 -11=5. So this solution is valid.But when we computed p via p=(9q² -10q +1)/4 for q=11, we get p=(9*121 -10*11 +1)/4=(1089 -110 +1)/4=980/4=245. But 245≠5. Wait, why the discrepancy?Ah, I see the problem. The formula p=(9q² -10q +1)/4 comes from case1a where the factor pair is (1,3q). However, when the factors are (a², b²)=(16,49), which correspond to a=4 and b=7, the equations are:p + q=16p +4q=49Subtracting: 3q=33 ⇒ q=11. Then p=16 -11=5.But in case1a, the assumption was that the factors are (1,3q), leading to equations:b -a=1, b +a=3q. However, in this new solution, the factors are (16,49), which are (a²,b²)=(4²,7²). Therefore, in case1, the factors can be any pair of squares, not necessarily the specific (1,3q) or (3,q). Therefore, my previous analysis was incomplete.Wait, no. Wait, when we have p + q and p +4q as squares, the equations lead to 3q=(b -a)(b +a). Therefore, depending on how we factorize 3q, which is prime or product of primes, into two factors (b -a) and (b +a). For example, in the case of q=11, 3q=33. Then factor pairs of33 are (1,33),(3,11). So:If we take (1,33):Then b -a=1, b +a=33. Adding:2b=34⇒b=17, a=16. Therefore, p + q=16²=256, p +4q=17²=289. Then subtract:3q=289 -256=33⇒q=11. Then p=256 -11=245. Which is what we saw earlier. But this is invalid as p=245 is not prime.Alternatively, factor pair (3,11):b -a=3, b +a=11. Adding:2b=14⇒b=7, a=4. Therefore, p + q=16, p +4q=49. Then subtract:3q=33⇒q=11, p=5. This gives valid primes. So in this case, the factor pair (3,11) of33 gives the solution (5,11). Therefore, in case1, when we have gcd=1, and 3q=(b -a)(b +a), we need to consider all possible factor pairs of3q, not just (1,3q). Earlier, I only considered the case where b -a=1, leading to case1a, but there's another factor pair when3q can be factored as3*q, i.e., (3,q). For example, when q=11,3q=33=3*11.Wait, but in case1, when we have gcd=1, we set:p + q=a²p +4q=b²Subtract to get3q=(b -a)(b +a). Therefore, 3q must be factored into two integers (b -a) and (b +a) such that b >a. The factors must satisfy that (b -a) and (b +a) are both integers, multiply to3q, and their average isb. Therefore, the factors must have the same parity. Since3q is either odd or even. Since q is prime, if q=2,3q=6, which is even. Otherwise, q is odd, so3q is odd. Therefore, factors of3q must both be odd. So possible factor pairs are (1,3q),(3,q). Therefore, for each odd prime q,3q can be factored as1*3q or3*q. So this leads us to two possibilities:For factor pair(1,3q): leading to b -a=1, b +a=3q. As we saw earlier.For factor pair(3,q): leading to b -a=3, b +a=q. But since q is prime, and b +a=q, b -a=3. Then adding:2b=q +3⇒b=(q +3)/2Subtracting:2a=q -3⇒a=(q -3)/2So, then p + q=a²⇒p=a² -q= [(q -3)/2]^2 -qBut this expression must yield prime p.For example, when q=11:a=(11 -3)/2=4, p=16 -11=5. Prime.Similarly, q=7:a=(7 -3)/2=2, p=4 -7=-3. Invalid.q=5:a=(5 -3)/2=1, p=1 -5=-4. Invalid.q=13:a=(13-3)/2=5, p=25 -13=12. Not prime.q=17:a=7, p=49 -17=32. Not prime.q=19:a=8, p=64 -19=45. Not prime.So only q=11 gives prime p=5. Therefore, this is another solution. Therefore, in case1, there are two possibilities for factor pairs of3q: (1,3q) and(3,q). The first gives solutions when q=3, and the second gives solution when q=11.Therefore, in our previous analysis, we missed considering the factor pair (3,q) for case1.Therefore, the complete solution for case1 (gcd=1) is:When factor pair(1,3q) leading to q=3, p=13.When factor pair(3,q) leading to q=11, p=5.Similarly, case2 (gcd=3) leading to q=5, p=7.Therefore, total solutions are:(13,3), (5,11), (7,5).But wait, check (5,11):p=5, q=11. Let's verify the original expression:5² +5*5*11 +4*11²=25 +275 + 484=784=28². Correct.So this is a valid solution. Similarly, (11,5):Check11² +5*11*5 +4*25=121 +275 +100=496. Not a square. So (11,5) is invalid.Therefore, only the ordered pairs (13,3), (5,11), (7,5) are solutions. Wait, but earlier when we considered case1 with factor pair(3,q) leading to q=11, p=5, which gives the valid pair (5,11). But when we first considered case1a with q=3, we got (13,3). In case2 with q=5, we got(7,5). So now we have three solutions: (13,3),(5,11),(7,5).But wait, how come when we checked case1 earlier with q=11, we didn't find p=5?Because in case1a, we derived p=(9q² -10q +1)/4, which for q=11 gives p=(1089 -110 +1)/4=980/4=245, which is not prime. But this corresponds to the factor pair(1,3q), which gives a different solution. However, when we use factor pair(3,q), we have a different equation leading to p=5.Therefore, the key is that in case1, there are two factor pairs for3q: (1,3q) and(3,q). Each leads to different expressions for p. Therefore, we need to consider both factor pairs.Therefore, the complete set of solutions are:From factor pair (1,3q):q=3, p=13.From factor pair (3,q):q=11, p=5.From case2 (gcd=3):q=5, p=7.Therefore, three solutions: (13,3),(5,11),(7,5).But let's verify if there are any more solutions for higher q.Check q=17:In case1, factor pair(3,q)=3,17. Then a=(17 -3)/2=7, p=49 -17=32. Not prime.q=7:factor pair(3,7). a=(7-3)/2=2, p=4 -7=-3. Invalid.q=19:a=(19-3)/2=8, p=64 -19=45. Not prime.q=23:a=10, p=100 -23=77. Not prime.q=13:a=5, p=25 -13=12. Not prime.So only q=11 gives p=5.Similarly, for case1a, higher q give non-prime p.Therefore, the solutions are (13,3),(5,11),(7,5).Wait, but (5,11) wasn't found in our initial analysis because we stopped at q=13 and didn't check further. Therefore, we have three solutions.Therefore, the answer should be these three pairs. But let me check for q=7 in case2:Wait, in case2, when gcd=3, we had p=(3q² -10q +3)/4. For q=7, this gives p=(3*49 -70 +3)/4=(147-70+3)/4=80/4=20, not prime.Similarly, for q=11:p=(3*121 -110 +3)/4=(363-110+3)/4=256/4=64, not prime.Therefore, only q=5 gives prime p=7.Therefore, the three pairs are:(13,3), (5,11), (7,5).But let's check if (5,11) and(7,5) are considered different pairs, which they are, since order matters in the pair unless specified otherwise. However, in our problem statement, it's written as pairs of primes (p,q), so order matters. But in the expression p² +5pq +4q², switching p and q changes the expression. For example, as checked earlier, (5,11) works, but (11,5) does not. Similarly, (7,5) works, but (5,7) would be different. Wait, (5,7):Compute5² +5*5*7 +4*7²=25 +175 +196=396, which is not a square. So only (7,5) works, not (5,7).Similarly, (3,13) was checked earlier and doesn't work. Hence, the valid ordered pairs are (13,3),(5,11),(7,5).But wait, earlier when we considered q=11, we found p=5. Let me check if there are any other primes q where p is prime. For example, q=7, but p=20 is not prime. q=13, p=12 not prime. q=17, p=32 not prime. So only (5,11) is an additional solution.Therefore, the complete solution set is (13,3), (5,11), (7,5).But wait, how did we get this new solution (5,11)? Because in the initial analysis, when we considered case1, we only considered the factor pair (1,3q), leading to p=(9q² -10q +1)/4, which for q=11 gives245, but when we considered the factor pair (3,q), it gives p=5. Therefore, we need to consider both factor pairs in case1.Therefore, the complete solution requires checking both factor pairs for case1, leading to three solutions in total.Hence, the pairs are:- (13,3) from case1 with factor pair (1,3q)- (5,11) from case1 with factor pair (3,q)- (7,5) from case2 with gcd=3Therefore, the answer should include all three pairs.But wait, let's verify again.For (5,11):p=5, q=11. Compute expression:25 +5*5*11 +4*121=25+275+484=784=28². Correct.For (7,5):p=7, q=5. Compute expression:49 +5*7*5 +4*25=49+175+100=324=18². Correct.For (13,3):13² +5*13*3 +4*9=169+195+36=400=20². Correct.Therefore, these three pairs are valid.But in our previous analysis, we missed (5,11) because we didn't consider the factor pair (3,q) in case1.Thus, the conclusion is that all pairs are (13,3), (5,11), and (7,5).But wait, are there any more pairs? Let's check q=7 in case1 with factor pair (3,q):q=7, then a=(7-3)/2=2, p=4-7=-3 invalid.q=17, a=(17-3)/2=7, p=49 -17=32 invalid.q=19, a=8, p=64 -19=45 invalid.q=23, a=10, p=100 -23=77 invalid.q=29, a=(29-3)/2=13, p=169 -29=140 invalid.So no other primes q give prime p in this case.Similarly, in case1a, q=3 gives p=13, q=11 gives p=245 (invalid), so only (13,3) here.In case2, only q=5 gives p=7.Therefore, the three pairs are indeed all solutions.Hence, the answer is the three prime pairs: (7,5), (13,3), and (5,11).But let me check if (5,11) is acceptable. In the problem statement, it's written as \\"all pairs of prime numbers (p, q)\\", so ordered pairs. Hence, (5,11) is distinct from (11,5), which doesn't work.Therefore, the complete solution set is (7,5), (13,3), and (5,11).But to confirm, let's check for q=11 in case2:case2: q=11, p=(3*121 -10*11 +3)/4=(363-110+3)/4=256/4=64, not prime. So (11,5) is invalid, but (5,11) is valid via case1.Thus, all pairs are (7,5), (13,3), (5,11).Therefore, the final answer should list these three pairs.But let me check if there's a prime q=2 which we haven't considered. Wait, q=2, if we use case1 with factor pair(3,q):But q=2, then3q=6. Factor pairs of6 are (1,6),(2,3). But these would be:If factor pair(1,6): p + q=1, invalid.Factor pair(2,3): p + q=2²=4, p +4q=3²=9. Therefore, p +2=4⇒p=2, q=2. But q=2, then p=2, but primes are allowed to be same? Wait, earlier we considered p≠q, but if p=q=2, then check the expression:2² +5*2*2 +4*2²=4+20+16=40, not a square. Therefore, invalid. Hence, q=2 doesn't work.Therefore, the three pairs are the only solutions.Final AnswerThe pairs are boxed{(5, 11)}, boxed{(7, 5)}, and boxed{(13, 3)}.</think>To determine all pairs of prime numbers ((p, q)) such that (p^2 + 5pq + 4q^2) is a perfect square, we start by factoring the expression:[p^2 + 5pq + 4q^2 = (p + q)(p + 4q)]We need this product to be a perfect square. Since (p) and (q) are primes, we consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (p + q) and (p + 4q). Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that (gcd(p + q, p + 4q)) can be 1 or 3.  Case 1: (gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = 1)In this case, both (p + q) and (p + 4q) must be perfect squares. Let:[p + q = a^2 quad text{and} quad p + 4q = b^2]Subtracting these equations gives:[3q = (b - a)(b + a)]Since (3q) must be factored into two integers, we consider factor pairs ((1, 3q)) and ((3, q)).# Subcase 1a: Factor pair ((1, 3q))[b - a = 1 quad text{and} quad b + a = 3q]Solving these, we get:[b = frac{3q + 1}{2} quad text{and} quad a = frac{3q - 1}{2}]Substituting back, we find (p = a^2 - q). For (q = 3), we get (p = 13), leading to the pair ((13, 3)).# Subcase 1b: Factor pair ((3, q))[b - a = 3 quad text{and} quad b + a = q]Solving these, we get:[b = frac{q + 3}{2} quad text{and} quad a = frac{q - 3}{2}]Substituting back, we find (p = a^2 - q). For (q = 11), we get (p = 5), leading to the pair ((5, 11)). Case 2: (gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = 3)In this case, we have:[p + q = 3m^2 quad text{and} quad p + 4q = 3n^2]Subtracting these equations gives:[3q = 3(n^2 - m^2) implies q = (n - m)(n + m)]Since (q) is prime, we consider the factor pair ((1, q)). Solving these, we get:[n = frac{q + 1}{2} quad text{and} quad m = frac{q - 1}{2}]Substituting back, we find (p = 3m^2 - q). For (q = 5), we get (p = 7), leading to the pair ((7, 5)). Verification- For ((13, 3)): (13^2 + 5 cdot 13 cdot 3 + 4 cdot 3^2 = 400 = 20^2)- For ((5, 11)): (5^2 + 5 cdot 5 cdot 11 + 4 cdot 11^2 = 784 = 28^2)- For ((7, 5)): (7^2 + 5 cdot 7 cdot 5 + 4 cdot 5^2 = 324 = 18^2)Thus, the pairs of prime numbers are:[boxed{(5, 11)}, boxed{(7, 5)}, boxed{(13, 3)}],<think>Okay, let's see. The problem is to find all pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that the expression p² + 5pq + 4q² is a perfect square. Hmm, primes, so p and q are primes. Alright, let's start by trying to understand the expression.First, maybe I can factor the quadratic expression. Let me look at p² + 5pq + 4q². Let's see if this can be factored. Let's try to factor it as (p + aq)(p + bq). Expanding that would give p² + (a + b)pq + abq². Comparing coefficients with the original expression, we have:a + b = 5ab = 4So, solving these equations. Let's see, a and b are roots of x² - 5x + 4 = 0. Let's factor that: (x - 1)(x - 4) = 0. So, a = 1 and b = 4. Therefore, the expression factors as (p + q)(p + 4q). So, p² + 5pq + 4q² = (p + q)(p + 4q). Okay, so the original expression is the product of (p + q) and (p + 4q). And we need this product to be a perfect square.So, if (p + q)(p + 4q) is a perfect square, then each prime in the factorization must appear an even number of times. Since p and q are primes, let's consider possible cases.But since (p + q) and (p + 4q) are two numbers, their product is a square. For two numbers multiplied together to be a square, they must be each square multiples of some common factor. That is, if we let d = gcd(p + q, p + 4q), then (p + q) = d * m² and (p + 4q) = d * n², where m and n are coprime integers. Then, the product would be d² m² n², which is a square.Alternatively, if they are coprime, then both (p + q) and (p + 4q) must themselves be squares. But first, let's check if (p + q) and (p + 4q) are coprime.Compute gcd(p + q, p + 4q). Let's subtract the two: (p + 4q) - (p + q) = 3q. So, gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = gcd(p + q, 3q). Since q is a prime, and p is another prime. Let's compute gcd(p + q, 3q). Since q is prime, either gcd(p + q, q) is 1 or q. But gcd(p + q, q) = gcd(p, q). Since p and q are primes, unless p = q, their gcd is 1. If p = q, then gcd(p + q, q) = q. So, two cases: p ≠ q and p = q.Case 1: p ≠ q. Then gcd(p + q, q) = 1. Therefore, gcd(p + q, 3q) = gcd(p + q, 3). Because gcd(p + q, q) = 1, so gcd(p + q, 3q) = gcd(p + q, 3). So, the gcd is either 1 or 3, depending on whether 3 divides (p + q).Case 2: p = q. Then, gcd(p + q, q) = q. Then, gcd(p + q, 3q) = gcd(2q, 3q) = q * gcd(2, 3) = q. So, in this case, the gcd is q.But since p and q are primes, let's first check if p = q is possible. If p = q, then the expression becomes p² + 5p*p + 4p² = p² + 5p² + 4p² = 10p². But 10p² is not a perfect square unless 10 is a square, which it isn't. So, p = q cannot be a solution. Therefore, we can assume p ≠ q.Therefore, back to Case 1: p ≠ q, so gcd(p + q, 3q) is either 1 or 3. Let's split into two subcases:Subcase 1: gcd(p + q, 3q) = 1. Then, since (p + q) and (p + 4q) are coprime, their product is a square, so each must be a square individually. Therefore, both (p + q) and (p + 4q) must be perfect squares.Subcase 2: gcd(p + q, 3q) = 3. Then, since the gcd is 3, we can write (p + q) = 3a² and (p + 4q) = 3b², where a and b are coprime integers. Then, the product would be 9a²b², which is a square. So in this case, both (p + q)/3 and (p + 4q)/3 must be perfect squares.Therefore, we have two scenarios to consider: either both (p + q) and (p + 4q) are squares, or both (p + q)/3 and (p + 4q)/3 are squares.Let's start with Subcase 1: (p + q) and (p + 4q) are squares.Let p + q = m² and p + 4q = n², where m and n are positive integers. Then, subtracting the two equations: (n² - m²) = 3q. So, 3q = (n - m)(n + m). Since q is prime, the factors (n - m) and (n + m) must be 1 and 3q, or 3 and q. But n and m are positive integers, so n > m. Let's check possible factor pairs:Case 1a: (n - m) = 1 and (n + m) = 3q. Then, solving these equations:n = m + 1Substitute into the second equation:(m + 1) + m = 3q => 2m + 1 = 3qSo, 2m = 3q - 1 => m = (3q - 1)/2But m must be an integer. Therefore, 3q - 1 must be even, so 3q must be odd. Since q is a prime, if q = 2, then 3*2 = 6, which is even, so 3q -1 = 5, which is odd. Wait, 3q is even only if q is even. The only even prime is 2. So, if q ≠ 2, then q is odd, so 3q is odd, so 3q - 1 is even. So, m is integer only if q = 2 or q is odd.Wait, but if q = 2, then 3q = 6, which is even, so 3q -1 = 5, which is odd. Then, m = 5/2, which is not integer. Therefore, if q = 2, m is not integer, so this case is invalid.If q is odd, then 3q is odd, so 3q -1 is even, so m is integer. Therefore, m = (3q -1)/2. Then, n = m +1 = (3q -1)/2 +1 = (3q -1 +2)/2 = (3q +1)/2.Now, recall that p + q = m². So, p = m² - q = [(3q -1)/2]^2 - q.Let's compute that:[(3q -1)/2]^2 - q = (9q² -6q +1)/4 - q = (9q² -6q +1 -4q)/4 = (9q² -10q +1)/4This must be a prime number. So, (9q² -10q +1)/4 must be prime. Since q is an odd prime (we already checked q=2 doesn't work here), let's let q be an odd prime.Let me test small primes:q=3:(9*9 -10*3 +1)/4 = (81 -30 +1)/4 = 52/4 =13. 13 is prime. So p=13. So pair (13, 3). Let's check: p=13, q=3. Compute expression: 13² +5*13*3 +4*3² = 169 + 195 + 36 = 400, which is 20². Perfect. So that works.Next, q=5:(9*25 -10*5 +1)/4 = (225 -50 +1)/4 = 176/4 =44. 44 is not prime. So discard.q=7:(9*49 -10*7 +1)/4 = (441 -70 +1)/4 = 372/4 =93. 93 is not prime. Discard.q=11:(9*121 -110 +1)/4 = (1089 -110 +1)/4 = 980/4 =245. 245 is not prime.q=13:(9*169 -130 +1)/4 = (1521 -130 +1)/4=1392/4=348. Not prime.So, only q=3 gives p=13. Let's check q=2 again, even though earlier steps suggested it doesn't work. If q=2:(9*4 -20 +1)/4=(36 -20 +1)/4=17/4=4.25. Not integer. So no.So, in Subcase1a, we have a possible solution (13,3). But let's check other factor pairs.Case1b: (n - m) =3 and (n + m)=q. Then, n - m=3 and n + m=q. Then, solving:Adding equations: 2n = q +3 => n=(q +3)/2Subtracting equations: 2m = q -3 => m=(q -3)/2But since m and n are positive integers, q must be odd (as primes except 2 are odd). If q=2:n=(2+3)/2=2.5, not integer. m=(2-3)/2=-0.5, invalid.If q is odd prime ≥3:Then, (q +3)/2 and (q -3)/2 must be integers. So, q must be odd, so q +3 and q -3 are even. So, q must be odd. Let's take q as odd primes.Then, m=(q -3)/2, n=(q +3)/2. Then, p + q = m². So, p = m² - q = [(q -3)/2]^2 - q.Compute:(q² -6q +9)/4 - q = (q² -6q +9 -4q)/4 = (q² -10q +9)/4Which factors as (q -1)(q -9)/4. Since q is a prime, let's test primes:q=3:(9 -30 +9)/4=(-12)/4=-3. Negative, invalid.q=5:(25 -50 +9)/4=(-16)/4=-4. Negative, invalid.q=7:(49 -70 +9)/4=(-12)/4=-3. Negative.q=11:(121 -110 +9)/4=20/4=5. 5 is prime. So p=5. So pair (5,11). Check if this works: p=5, q=11.Compute expression: 25 + 5*5*11 +4*121=25 +275 +484=784=28². Perfect. So that's another solution.Wait, so (5,11) works. But according to the above, when we considered Case1b with q=11, we have p=(121 -110 +9)/4=20/4=5. So p=5, which is prime. So that's a valid solution.Wait, but why when I considered q=5 earlier, it didn't work? Wait, no. When q=11, we get p=5, which is prime. Let me check more primes.q=13:(169 -130 +9)/4=48/4=12. Not prime.q=17:(289 -170 +9)/4=128/4=32. Not prime.q=19:(361 -190 +9)/4=180/4=45. Not prime.So only q=11 gives p=5. Thus, the pair (5,11) is another solution.Wait, but when we considered Case1a, we got (13,3), and here in Case1b, we get (5,11). So these are two solutions in Subcase1 where (p + q) and (p +4q) are squares.But let's check if there are other factorizations. The original equation was 3q = (n - m)(n + m). Since 3q is the product, and q is prime, the possible factor pairs are (1, 3q), (3, q). We considered both. So there are only two possibilities.Therefore, in Subcase1, the solutions are (13,3) and (5,11). Now, let's check Subcase2.Subcase2: gcd(p + q, 3q)=3. Therefore, we can write (p + q)=3a² and (p +4q)=3b², with a and b coprime integers. Then, subtracting the two equations:(p +4q)-(p + q)=3q=3b² -3a² => q = b² - a².Therefore, q = (b -a)(b +a). Since q is prime, the factors must be 1 and q. Therefore, b -a=1 and b +a=q. Solving these:Adding equations: 2b = q +1 => b=(q +1)/2Subtracting equations: 2a = q -1 => a=(q -1)/2Since a and b must be integers, q must be odd. Therefore, q is an odd prime. Let's express p from (p + q)=3a²:p =3a² - q =3[(q -1)/2]^2 - qCompute:3*(q² -2q +1)/4 - q = (3q² -6q +3)/4 - q = (3q² -6q +3 -4q)/4 = (3q² -10q +3)/4This must be a prime number. Let's test for small odd primes:q=3:(27 -30 +3)/4=0/4=0. Not prime.q=5:(75 -50 +3)/4=28/4=7. 7 is prime. So p=7. Pair (7,5). Check expression:7² +5*7*5 +4*25=49 +175 +100=324=18². Correct. So that works.q=7:(147 -70 +3)/4=80/4=20. Not prime.q=11:(363 -110 +3)/4=256/4=64. Not prime.q=13:(507 -130 +3)/4=380/4=95. Not prime.q=17:(3*289 -170 +3)/4=(867 -170 +3)/4=700/4=175. Not prime.q=2: Not odd. So, only q=5 gives p=7. Therefore, the pair (7,5) is a solution.Wait, but (7,5) and (5,11) are different pairs. Let's check if (7,5) is a valid solution. As above, p=7, q=5. The expression is 7² +5*7*5 +4*25=49 +175 +100=324=18². Yep, correct.So, in Subcase2, we have the solution (7,5). Let's check if there are other possibilities here.Since q = b² -a², with b=(q+1)/2 and a=(q-1)/2. Then, substituting, q must be an odd prime. So testing odd primes, but only q=5 gives prime p=7. So that's the only solution here.Therefore, combining the solutions from both subcases:From Subcase1: (13,3) and (5,11)From Subcase2: (7,5)But wait, (7,5) and (5,11) – are there more solutions? Let's check if there are overlapping or other solutions.Wait, let's check q=3 in Subcase2. For q=3:p =3[(3 -1)/2]^2 -3=3*(1)^2 -3=0, which is invalid. So no.Similarly, q=7:p=3[(7-1)/2]^2 -7=3*(3)^2 -7=27 -7=20, which is not prime.So only q=5 gives p=7.Wait, but let's check the pair (7,5) and (5,7). Since p and q are both primes, but the problem says \\"all pairs\\", so ordered pairs? Or unordered?The problem says \\"all pairs of prime numbers (p, q)\\", so ordered pairs. But since the expression p² +5pq +4q² is symmetric in p and q? Wait, no. Let's check.Wait, the expression is p² +5pq +4q². If we swap p and q, it becomes q² +5qp +4p² = 4p² +5pq +q². Which is different from the original expression unless p=q. Therefore, the expression is not symmetric in p and q. Hence, the pairs (p, q) and (q, p) might not both be solutions.Wait, for example, take (5,11):Original expression:5² +5*5*11 +4*11²=25 +275 +484=784=28².If we swap to (11,5):11² +5*11*5 +4*5²=121 +275 +100=496. Is 496 a square? 22²=484, 23²=529. So no. So (11,5) is not a solution. Therefore, the pairs are ordered. So (5,11) is a solution, but (11,5) is not. Similarly, (7,5) is a solution, but (5,7):p=5, q=7:5² +5*5*7 +4*7²=25 +175 +196=396. 396 is not a perfect square (19²=361, 20²=400). So no. Similarly, (13,3):13² +5*13*3 +4*3²=169 +195 +36=400=20². Swapped (3,13):3² +5*3*13 +4*13²=9 +195 +676=880. 29²=841, 30²=900. Not a square. So no. Therefore, the pairs are ordered.Therefore, so far, we have three solutions: (13,3), (5,11), (7,5). Wait, but wait, (7,5) and (5,11). Let's see if there are more solutions. Let's check higher primes.For Subcase1a: q=3 gives p=13. Let's check next primes. q=7, but in Subcase1a, p=(9q² -10q +1)/4. So for q=7, we get p=(9*49 -70 +1)/4=(441 -70 +1)/4=372/4=93. Not prime. So no.q=17: p=(9*289 -170 +1)/4=(2601 -170 +1)/4=2432/4=608. Not prime.Similarly, Subcase1b: solving for other q. For example, q=17:(q -1)(q -9)/4. Wait, no, the expression was (q² -10q +9)/4. For q=17: (289 -170 +9)/4=128/4=32. Not prime. So no.Similarly, in Subcase2, q=5 gives p=7, but higher primes don't.Wait, but perhaps there are other factorizations? Wait, in Subcase1, we considered the factor pairs (1,3q) and (3,q). Are there other factor pairs? For example, if q=3, then 3q=9. Then possible factor pairs could be (9,1), but also (3,3). But (3,3) would require n - m=3 and n + m=3. But then n=3, m=0, which isn't valid. Similarly, if q=3, 3q=9, factors are (1,9) and (3,3). But (3,3) gives n=3, m=0, which isn't valid. So no other factor pairs. So only the two possibilities.Therefore, the three solutions found are (13,3), (5,11), and (7,5). Wait, but let's check if there are more solutions in Subcase2.Wait, in Subcase2, when we set (p + q)=3a² and (p +4q)=3b², leading to q=(b² - a²). So q must be expressed as a difference of squares. Since q is prime, the only way to write it as difference of squares is ( (q +1)/2 )² - ( (q -1)/2 )². So that's unique. Therefore, only when 3a² - q is prime. So for q=5, gives p=7. For other primes, it gives non-prime p. So only (7,5) here.Thus, combining all solutions, we have:From Subcase1a: (13,3)From Subcase1b: (5,11)From Subcase2: (7,5)But wait, let's check if there are other possibilities when the gcd is 3.Wait, in Subcase2, we have (p + q)=3a² and (p +4q)=3b². If a and b are not coprime, but since in the equations, we required a and b to be coprime? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, but if they share a common factor, then the equations would imply that common factor divides both 3a² and 3b², but since we factored out the gcd=3, maybe a and b are coprime? Let me check.Given that (p + q)=3a² and (p +4q)=3b². Then, subtracting gives 3q=3b² -3a² => q = b² -a². Therefore, since q is prime, (b -a)(b +a)=q. So since q is prime, b -a=1 and b +a=q. Therefore, solving gives unique a and b, as before. Therefore, regardless of a and b, they are determined by q. Therefore, in this case, a and b are consecutive integers (since b -a=1), so they are coprime. Therefore, the only solution here is when q can be written as ( (q +1)/2 )² - ( (q -1)/2 )², leading to p=3a² -q. So only when q=5 gives p=7. Therefore, only (7,5) here.Therefore, total solutions are (13,3), (5,11), (7,5). Let me verify once more each:(13,3):13² +5*13*3 +4*3²=169 +195 +36=400=20². Correct.(5,11):5² +5*5*11 +4*11²=25 +275 +484=784=28². Correct.(7,5):7² +5*7*5 +4*5²=49 +175 +100=324=18². Correct.Are there any other primes we need to check? For example, let's try q=7 in Subcase1a:q=7, p=(9*49 -70 +1)/4=(441 -70 +1)/4=372/4=93. Not prime.q=11 in Subcase1a:p=(9*121 -110 +1)/4=(1089 -110 +1)/4=980/4=245. Not prime.Similarly, in Subcase1b, q=7 gives p=(q² -10q +9)/4=(49 -70 +9)/4=(-12)/4=-3. Invalid.q=13:(169 -130 +9)/4=48/4=12. Not prime.q=17:(289 -170 +9)/4=128/4=32. Not prime.So no other primes in these subcases.Is there a possibility that we missed solutions where the gcd(p + q, 3q) is 3, but with higher exponents? For example, maybe (p + q)=3² *a², but then the product would not necessarily be square unless (p +4q) is also a multiple of 3². But according to our earlier analysis, gcd(p + q, p +4q)=3, so we can't have higher powers. Because if 9 divides both (p +q) and (p +4q), then 9 divides their difference, which is 3q. Therefore, 9 divides 3q => 3 divides q. But q is prime, so q=3. Let's check q=3 in this scenario.If q=3, then gcd(p +3, p +12)=gcd(p +3,9). Since p is a prime different from q=3 (since p ≠ q as discussed earlier). If p ≠3, then p is not divisible by 3. So p can be 1 mod 3 or 2 mod 3.If p ≡1 mod3, then p +3 ≡1 +0=1 mod3, so gcd(1,9)=1. If p ≡2 mod3, p +3 ≡2 +0=2 mod3, gcd(2,9)=1. Therefore, gcd(p +3,9)=1 or 3. If p ≡0 mod3, then p=3, but p ≠q=3, so p=3 is not allowed. Wait, if p=3 and q=3, but earlier we saw that p=q=3 gives 10p²=90, not square. So q=3.But wait, if q=3, then in Subcase2, let's try q=3:q=3, then p=3a² -3. From (p +3)=3a², so p=3a² -3=3(a² -1). Since p must be prime, 3(a² -1) is prime. The only way this is possible is if a² -1=1, so a²=2, which is not integer. Or if a² -1= prime/3. Not possible. Therefore, no solution here.So, if q=3, then there's no solution in Subcase2. Therefore, our initial solutions still stand.Wait, but in our earlier analysis, we found (13,3) via Subcase1a. So that's valid.Therefore, after checking all possible cases, the solutions are:(13,3), (5,11), and (7,5).Wait, but let's check if there are any other possibilities when the gcd is 3 but with different exponents.Alternatively, could the original expression be a square in a different way? For example, maybe (p + q)(p +4q) is a square, but the factors share a common factor greater than 3. But we saw that gcd(p + q, p +4q)=gcd(p +q,3q), which is either 1 or 3. So no, there are no other common factors. Therefore, the only possibilities are Subcase1 and Subcase2.Therefore, the three pairs are (13,3), (5,11), and (7,5). But let's check if (3,13) is a solution. Wait, earlier we saw that (3,13):3² +5*3*13 +4*13²=9 +195 +676=880, which is not a square, so invalid. Similarly, (11,5) is invalid, as checked before.Therefore, the valid ordered pairs are (13,3), (5,11), and (7,5). Wait, but hang on, in Subcase1a, we had q=3 gives p=13. Similarly, in Subcase1b, q=11 gives p=5, and in Subcase2, q=5 gives p=7. Thus, the three ordered pairs.But are there any more solutions? Let's check q=7 in Subcase2: q=7, p=3*( (7 -1)/2 )² -7=3*(3)^2 -7=27 -7=20, not prime.q=11 in Subcase2: p=3*((11 -1)/2)^2 -11=3*(5)^2 -11=75 -11=64, not prime.q=13: p=3*((13 -1)/2)^2 -13=3*(6)^2 -13=108 -13=95, not prime.Similarly, q=17: p=3*((17 -1)/2)^2 -17=3*(8)^2 -17=192 -17=175, not prime.So no more solutions there.Therefore, the conclusion is that the pairs (5,11), (7,5), and (13,3) are the only solutions.Wait, but let's check another angle. Suppose the original expression is p² +5pq +4q² = (p + q)(p +4q). Let me compute this for p=2, q=2: (2 +2)(2 +8)=4*10=40, not square. For p=2, q=3: (5)(2 +12)=5*14=70, not square. p=2, q=5: (7)(2 +20)=7*22=154, not square. p=2, q=7: (9)(2 +28)=9*30=270, not square. Similarly, p=2, q=11: (13)(2 +44)=13*46=598, not square. So p=2 doesn't seem to give any solution.Similarly, p=3, q=2: (5)(3 +8)=5*11=55, not square. p=3, q=5: (8)(3 +20)=8*23=184, not square. p=3, q=7: (10)(3 +28)=10*31=310, not square. So p=3 also only gives solution when q=3 is not allowed, and q=13 gives p=13. Which we already covered.Similarly, p=5, q=2: (7)(5 +8)=7*13=91, not square. p=5, q=3: (8)(5 +12)=8*17=136, not square. p=5, q=7: (12)(5 +28)=12*33=396, not square. But we have p=5, q=11 as a solution. Which we already considered.Similarly, p=7, q=2: (9)(7 +8)=9*15=135, not square. p=7, q=3: (10)(7 +12)=10*19=190, not square. p=7, q=5: 12*27=324=18². Which we already have. p=7, q=7: (14)(7 +28)=14*35=490, not square.p=11, q=2: (13)(11 +8)=13*19=247, not square. p=11, q=3: (14)(11 +12)=14*23=322, not square. p=11, q=5: (16)(11 +20)=16*31=496, not square. p=11, q=7: (18)(11 +28)=18*39=702, not square. p=11, q=11: (22)(11 +44)=22*55=1210, not square.Similarly, p=13, q=2: (15)(13 +8)=15*21=315, not square. p=13, q=3: (16)(13 +12)=16*25=400=20², which is the solution (13,3). p=13, q=5: (18)(13 +20)=18*33=594, not square. Etc.So, after checking all small primes and considering the structure of the equations, it seems the only solutions are (13,3), (5,11), and (7,5). Let me check once more if there might be other pairs with larger primes.Take p=17, q=?: Let's try q=19. Compute (17 +19)(17 +76)=36*93=3348. Not a square. Similarly, p=19, q=?: Maybe q=7. (19+7)(19 +28)=26*47=1222, not square. So no.Alternatively, think algebraically. For Subcase1a and 1b, we have the only solutions when q=3 and q=11. For Subcase2, q=5. Therefore, these are the only solutions.Therefore, the answer is the three pairs: (5,11), (7,5), and (13,3). But wait, in the problem statement, the pairs are (p, q). Are these ordered pairs? For example, (7,5) and (5,7) are different. Since in the problem statement, it's not specified whether order matters. Wait, but the expression is not symmetric. For example, (7,5) gives 324=18², but (5,7) gives 25 +175 +196=396≠ square. So order matters. Therefore, the valid ordered pairs are (5,11), (7,5), and (13,3). Hence, three solutions.But wait, let me check if (3,13) is a solution. p=3, q=13:3² +5*3*13 +4*13²=9 +195 +676=880. 880 is not a perfect square. So no. So only (13,3) is a solution, not the reverse.Similarly, (11,5): p=11, q=5:11² +5*11*5 +4*25=121 +275 +100=496. Not a square. So no.Thus, the three ordered pairs are indeed distinct and only those three.Final AnswerThe pairs are boxed{(5, 11)}, boxed{(7, 5)}, and boxed{(13, 3)}.</think>To determine all pairs of prime numbers ((p, q)) such that (p^2 + 5pq + 4q^2) is a perfect square, we start by factoring the expression:[p^2 + 5pq + 4q^2 = (p + q)(p + 4q)]We need this product to be a perfect square. We consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (p + q) and (p + 4q):1. Case 1: gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = 1   - Both (p + q) and (p + 4q) must be perfect squares.   - Let (p + q = m^2) and (p + 4q = n^2). Subtracting these equations gives (3q = n^2 - m^2 = (n - m)(n + m)).   - Solving for factor pairs ((1, 3q)) and ((3, q)):     - For ((n - m) = 1) and ((n + m) = 3q), we find (p = 13) and (q = 3).     - For ((n - m) = 3) and ((n + m) = q), we find (p = 5) and (q = 11).2. Case 2: gcd(p + q, p + 4q) = 3   - Let (p + q = 3a^2) and (p + 4q = 3b^2). Subtracting these equations gives (3q = 3b^2 - 3a^2), leading to (q = b^2 - a^2).   - Solving for (q = (b - a)(b + a)) with (b - a = 1) and (b + a = q), we find (p = 7) and (q = 5).After verifying all solutions, the valid pairs of prime numbers are:[boxed{(5, 11)}, boxed{(7, 5)}, boxed{(13, 3)}]]"},{"problem":"Suppose the complex number z is a pure imaginary number and satisfies the equation (2-i)z=a+i (where i is the imaginary unit), then the value of the real number a is ______.","solution":"From (2-i)z=a+i, we havez= frac{a+i}{2-i}= frac{(a+i)(2+i)}{(2-i)(2+i)}= frac{(2a-1)+(a+2)i}{5}= frac{2a-1}{5}+ frac{a+2}{5}i,Since z is a pure imaginary number, it follows thatbegin{cases} frac{2a-1}{5}=0  frac{a+2}{5}neq 0 end{cases},Solving for a, we obtain a= frac{1}{2}.Thus, the value of the real number a is: boxed{frac{1}{2}}.To solve this problem, we first obtain z= frac{a+i}{2-i} from (2-i)z=a+i.

It is a foundational question.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I have this problem here: If the complex number z is a pure imaginary number and satisfies the equation (2 - i)z = a + i, where a is a real number, then I need to find the value of a. Hmm, let me think step by step.First, let's recall what a pure imaginary number is. A pure imaginary number is a complex number that has no real part. So, it can be written as z = ki, where k is a real number. That makes sense because the real part is zero, and the imaginary part is k times i. So z is purely along the imaginary axis in the complex plane.Now, the equation given is (2 - i)z = a + i. Since z is pure imaginary, let me substitute z with ki. Then the left-hand side becomes (2 - i)(ki). Let's compute that.Multiplying out (2 - i)(ki):First, distribute ki over both terms:2*(ki) - i*(ki)Calculate each term:2*(ki) = 2ki-i*(ki) = -i^2*kBut i squared is -1, so -i^2*k = -(-1)*k = kSo combining these two terms: 2ki + kTherefore, (2 - i)z = k + 2kiBut the problem states that this equals a + i, where a is a real number. So, set the real and imaginary parts equal.So, equate the real parts: k = aAnd equate the imaginary parts: 2k = 1Wait, because on the left-hand side (k + 2ki), the real part is k and the imaginary part is 2k. On the right-hand side (a + i), the real part is a and the imaginary part is 1 (since it's 1*i). Therefore, equating real and imaginary components:Real: k = aImaginary: 2k = 1So from the imaginary part equation, 2k = 1 implies k = 1/2Then, substituting back into the real part equation, a = k = 1/2Therefore, the value of a is 1/2.Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's substitute z = (1/2)i into the original equation and see if it works.Left-hand side: (2 - i)*(1/2)iFirst, multiply out:2*(1/2)i = iAnd -i*(1/2)i = - (1/2)i^2 = - (1/2)*(-1) = 1/2So adding those together: i + 1/2 = 1/2 + iWhich is equal to a + i. Therefore, comparing real and imaginary parts:Real part: 1/2 = aImaginary part: 1 = 1, which checks out.So yes, a is indeed 1/2. That seems correct. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure.1. Recognize that z is pure imaginary, so write z = ki for real k.2. Multiply (2 - i) by ki: (2 - i)(ki) = 2ki - i(ki) = 2ki + k3. Express the result as a complex number: k + 2ki4. Set this equal to a + i, so equate real parts (k = a) and imaginary parts (2k = 1)5. Solve for k: 2k = 1 => k = 1/2, hence a = 1/26. Verify by plugging back into original equation to confirm.Everything seems to check out. So, the real number a is 1/2.Final AnswerThe value of the real number ( a ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}.</think>Given that the complex number ( z ) is a pure imaginary number and satisfies the equation ((2 - i)z = a + i), we need to find the value of the real number ( a ).1. Since ( z ) is a pure imaginary number, we can write ( z = ki ) where ( k ) is a real number.2. Substitute ( z = ki ) into the equation ((2 - i)z):   [   (2 - i)(ki) = 2ki - i(ki)   ]3. Simplify the expression:   [   2ki - i(ki) = 2ki - i^2k = 2ki + k   ]   (since ( i^2 = -1 ), so ( -i^2k = k ))4. The result ( 2ki + k ) can be written as ( k + 2ki ), which is a complex number with real part ( k ) and imaginary part ( 2k ).5. Set this equal to ( a + i ), where ( a ) is a real number. Equate the real and imaginary parts:   [   text{Real part: } k = a   ]   [   text{Imaginary part: } 2k = 1   ]6. Solve for ( k ):   [   2k = 1 implies k = frac{1}{2}   ]7. Therefore, ( a = k = frac{1}{2} ).Verification:Substitute ( z = frac{1}{2}i ) back into the original equation:[(2 - i)left(frac{1}{2}iright) = 2 cdot frac{1}{2}i - i cdot frac{1}{2}i = i + frac{1}{2}]This simplifies to ( frac{1}{2} + i ), which matches ( a + i ) with ( a = frac{1}{2} ).Thus, the value of the real number ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).,<think>Okay, so I need to find the real number 'a' such that the complex number z, which is purely imaginary, satisfies the equation (2 - i)z = a + i. Let me start by recalling that a pure imaginary number has the form z = bi where b is a real number, and the real part is zero. First, let me write down what I know. The equation given is (2 - i)z = a + i. Since z is pure imaginary, let me substitute z with bi. So, substituting that into the equation:(2 - i)(bi) = a + iNow, I need to multiply out the left side. Let's distribute bi across the terms in the parentheses:2 * bi - i * biCalculating each term separately. The first term is 2*bi, which is 2bi. The second term is -i*bi. Let me compute that. Multiplying -i by bi: that's -i * bi = -b i^2. But since i^2 is -1, this becomes -b*(-1) = b. So the second term is b. Putting it all together, the left side becomes 2bi + b. So:2bi + b = a + iNow, let's express the left side as a complex number in standard form (real part + imaginary part). The real part is b and the imaginary part is 2b. So:Left side: b + 2biRight side: a + iFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real parts must be equal, and their imaginary parts must be equal. Therefore:Real part: b = aImaginary part: 2b = 1So from the imaginary part equation, 2b = 1, which means b = 1/2. Then substituting back into the real part equation, we get a = b = 1/2. Therefore, the value of the real number a is 1/2. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's substitute a = 1/2 back into the original equation and see if z is indeed pure imaginary. Given a = 1/2, the equation becomes:(2 - i)z = 1/2 + iWe need to solve for z. Let's divide both sides by (2 - i):z = (1/2 + i) / (2 - i)To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 + i):z = [(1/2 + i)(2 + i)] / [(2 - i)(2 + i)]First compute the denominator: (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5Now compute the numerator: (1/2)(2) + (1/2)(i) + i(2) + i(i)Calculating each term:(1/2)(2) = 1(1/2)(i) = (1/2)ii(2) = 2ii(i) = i^2 = -1So adding these up: 1 + (1/2)i + 2i - 1 = (1 - 1) + (1/2 + 2)i = 0 + (5/2)i = (5/2)iTherefore, z = (5/2)i / 5 = (5/2)/5 * i = (1/2)iWhich is indeed a pure imaginary number, as expected. So z = (1/2)i, which is bi where b = 1/2. Then a = b = 1/2. Therefore, the answer is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by expressing z as 0 + bi and perform the multiplication step-by-step. Let's try that way too.Let z = 0 + bi. Then (2 - i)(bi) = a + iMultiplying 2 by bi gives 2bi. Multiplying -i by bi gives -i*bi = -b i^2 = -b*(-1) = b. So total is 2bi + b. Therefore, same as before, real part is b, imaginary part is 2b. Setting equal to a + i, so real parts: b = a; imaginary parts: 2b = 1. Hence, b=1/2, so a=1/2. Yep, same result.Another way: Let's suppose z is pure imaginary, so z = bi. Then, the equation (2 - i)z = a + i. Let's compute (2 - i)z:(2 - i)(bi) = 2bi - i(bi) = 2bi - b i^2 = 2bi - b(-1) = 2bi + b. Which is b + 2bi. So equate to a + i. Therefore, real part b = a, imaginary part 2b = 1. So, again, same answer. I think that's thorough. All approaches confirm that a = 1/2. Therefore, the answer should be 1/2.Final AnswerThe value of the real number ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).</think>Given that the complex number ( z ) is a pure imaginary number and satisfies the equation ( (2 - i)z = a + i ), we need to find the value of the real number ( a ).Since ( z ) is a pure imaginary number, we can write ( z = bi ) where ( b ) is a real number. Substituting ( z = bi ) into the equation:[(2 - i)(bi) = a + i]Expanding the left-hand side:[2bi - i(bi) = 2bi - b(i^2)]Since ( i^2 = -1 ), this simplifies to:[2bi - b(-1) = 2bi + b]This can be written as:[b + 2bi]Equating the real and imaginary parts of both sides of the equation ( b + 2bi = a + i ):- Real part: ( b = a )- Imaginary part: ( 2b = 1 )Solving the imaginary part equation gives:[2b = 1 implies b = frac{1}{2}]Substituting ( b = frac{1}{2} ) into the real part equation gives:[a = b = frac{1}{2}]Thus, the value of the real number ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).]"},{"problem":"3. The range of the function f(x)=2 sqrt{x^{2}-4 x+3}+sqrt{3+4 x-x^{2}} is","solution":"3. [sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to find the range of the function f(x) = 2√(x² - 4x + 3) + √(3 + 4x - x²). Hmm, ranges can be tricky, especially with square roots involved. Let me start by figuring out the domains of each square root separately because the function is only defined where both square roots are real numbers.First, let's look at the expression inside the first square root: x² - 4x + 3. To find where this is non-negative, I need to solve the inequality x² - 4x + 3 ≥ 0. Let me factor that quadratic. Let's see, factors of 3 that add up to -4... That would be -1 and -3. So, x² - 4x + 3 factors to (x - 1)(x - 3) ≥ 0. So, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3. Testing intervals, for x < 1, say x=0: (0-1)(0-3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 ≥ 0. Between 1 and 3, say x=2: (2-1)(2-3) = 1*(-1) = -1 < 0. And for x > 3, say x=4: (4-1)(4-3) = 3*1 = 3 ≥ 0. So, the domain for the first square root is x ≤ 1 or x ≥ 3.Now, the second square root: √(3 + 4x - x²). Let's set the inside to be ≥ 0: -x² + 4x + 3 ≥ 0. Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality): x² - 4x - 3 ≤ 0. Let's find the roots of x² - 4x - 3 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = [4 ± √(16 + 12)] / 2 = [4 ± √28]/2 = [4 ± 2√7]/2 = 2 ± √7. So, the quadratic x² - 4x - 3 is positive outside the roots and negative between them. Since we have x² - 4x - 3 ≤ 0, the solution is 2 - √7 ≤ x ≤ 2 + √7. Approximately, √7 is about 2.6458, so the interval is roughly from 2 - 2.6458 ≈ -0.6458 to 2 + 2.6458 ≈ 4.6458.So, the domain for the second square root is approximately [-0.6458, 4.6458]. Now, the overall domain of f(x) is the intersection of the domains of both square roots. The first square root is defined on (-∞, 1] ∪ [3, ∞), and the second is on [2 - √7, 2 + √7]. Let's compute the intersection.First, intersect (-∞,1] with [2 - √7, 2 + √7]. Since 2 - √7 ≈ -0.6458, which is greater than -∞, so the lower bound is 2 - √7. And 1 is less than 2 + √7 ≈ 4.6458, so the upper bound is 1. So the left interval is [2 - √7, 1]. Then, intersect [3, ∞) with [2 - √7, 2 + √7]. The lower bound is 3, and the upper bound is 2 + √7 ≈ 4.6458. But wait, 3 is less than 4.6458, so the intersection is [3, 2 + √7]. So overall, the domain of f(x) is [2 - √7, 1] ∪ [3, 2 + √7]. Let me confirm that:Original first domain: x ≤1 or x ≥3. Second domain: 2 - √7 ≈ -0.6458 ≤ x ≤ 4.6458. So the intersection is from 2 - √7 to 1 (since x must be ≤1 and ≥2 - √7) and from 3 to 2 + √7 (since x must be ≥3 and ≤2 + √7). So yes, that's correct.So the domain is two intervals: [2 - √7, 1] and [3, 2 + √7]. Now, I need to find the range of f(x) over these intervals. That is, find all possible values of f(x) when x is in [2 - √7,1] or [3, 2 + √7].This seems complicated because the function is a combination of two square roots. Maybe I can analyze each interval separately and then take the union of the ranges.Let me first consider the interval [2 - √7, 1]. Let's denote x in [2 - √7, 1]. Then f(x) = 2√(x² -4x +3) + √(3 +4x -x²).Let me simplify the expressions inside the square roots. For the first square root: x² -4x +3. That can be written as (x² -4x +4) -1 = (x - 2)^2 -1. Similarly, the second square root: 3 +4x -x² = -x² +4x +3. Let's write that as -(x² -4x) +3 = -(x² -4x +4 -4) +3 = -(x -2)^2 +4 +3 = -(x -2)^2 +7.So, substituting back:f(x) = 2√[(x - 2)^2 -1] + √[7 - (x -2)^2]Let me let t = x - 2. Then when x is in [2 - √7,1], t ranges from (2 - √7) - 2 = -√7 to 1 -2 = -1. So t ∈ [-√7, -1].Then, f(x) becomes 2√(t² -1) + √(7 - t²). Wait, but t is in [-√7, -1]. However, t² is the same for t and |t|, so since we have t² in both square roots, maybe it's better to consider t as a positive variable. Wait, but t is negative here. Let me check if that affects anything. Since t is squared, the expression inside the square roots only depend on t². So, √(t² -1) is √(t² -1), regardless of t being negative. Similarly, √(7 - t²) is same as if t were positive. So, maybe we can substitute u = |t|, but since t is in [-√7, -1], |t| is in [1, √7]. So, substituting u = |t|, which is in [1, √7]. Then, f(x) can be written as 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²), where u ∈ [1, √7]. Because t is negative, but u is positive.Similarly, when x is in [3, 2 + √7], then x -2 is in [1, √7]. So t = x -2 ∈ [1, √7]. So then f(x) = 2√(t² -1) + √(7 - t²) with t ∈ [1, √7]. So in both intervals, x -2 is either in [-√7, -1] or [1, √7], but in both cases, u = |x -2| is in [1, √7]. So, f(x) can be written as 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²), where u ∈ [1, √7]. Therefore, the function simplifies in terms of u. That's a key insight! Therefore, instead of dealing with two separate intervals for x, we can let u = |x - 2|, where u ranges from 1 to √7, and then f(x) becomes 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the range of the function g(u) = 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²) where u ∈ [1, √7]. So that simplifies the problem to a single variable function. Nice!So now, I need to find the range of g(u) = 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²) for u ∈ [1, √7]. Let's denote u as a variable between 1 and √7. To find the range, we can consider the maximum and minimum values of g(u). To do this, we can take the derivative of g(u) with respect to u, find critical points, and evaluate g(u) at those points as well as at the endpoints.First, let's compute the derivative g'(u):g(u) = 2√(u² -1) + √(7 - u²)So, derivative term by term:d/du [2√(u² -1)] = 2*(1/(2√(u² -1)))*(2u) = (2u)/√(u² -1)Wait, let me check that again. The derivative of 2√(u² -1) is 2*(1/(2√(u² -1)))*(2u). Wait, no. Wait, the chain rule: derivative of √(h(u)) is (1/(2√(h(u))))*h'(u). So, derivative of 2√(u² -1) is 2*(1/(2√(u² -1)))*(2u). Wait, no: h(u) = u² -1, so h'(u) = 2u. Therefore, derivative is 2*(1/(2√(u² -1)))*2u = (2u)/√(u² -1). Wait, no, 2*( derivative of sqrt(h(u)) ). The derivative of sqrt(h(u)) is (1/(2√(h(u))))*h'(u). Therefore, 2*( (1/(2√(u² -1)))*(2u) ) = 2*( (2u)/(2√(u² -1)) ) = 2*(u/√(u² -1)) = (2u)/√(u² -1). Yeah, that's correct.Similarly, derivative of √(7 - u²):d/du [√(7 - u²)] = (1/(2√(7 - u²)))*(-2u) = (-u)/√(7 - u²)Therefore, total derivative:g'(u) = (2u)/√(u² -1) - (u)/√(7 - u²)To find critical points, set g'(u) = 0:(2u)/√(u² -1) - (u)/√(7 - u²) = 0Factor out u:u [ 2/√(u² -1) - 1/√(7 - u²) ] = 0Since u ∈ [1, √7], and at u=1, the first term's denominator becomes √(1 -1) = 0, which is undefined. So, actually, u is in (1, √7). Wait, but at u=1, g(u) is 2√(1 -1) + √(7 -1) = 0 + √6 = √6. Similarly, at u=√7, g(u) is 2√(7 -1) + √(7 -7) = 2√6 + 0 = 2√6. So, endpoints are u=1 and u=√7, but in between, u ∈ (1, √7). So, critical points would be in (1, √7).So, back to the equation:u [ 2/√(u² -1) - 1/√(7 - u²) ] = 0Since u ≠ 0 in this interval, the term in the brackets must be zero:2/√(u² -1) - 1/√(7 - u²) = 0Therefore,2/√(u² -1) = 1/√(7 - u²)Cross-multiplying:2√(7 - u²) = √(u² -1)Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:4(7 - u²) = u² -1Expand:28 - 4u² = u² -1Bring all terms to one side:28 +1 = u² +4u²29 = 5u²So, u² = 29/5 → u = √(29/5) ≈ √(5.8) ≈ 2.408. Let's check if this is within the interval (1, √7). Since √7 ≈ 2.6458, so √(29/5) ≈ 2.408 is indeed in (1, √7). So, u = √(29/5) is a critical point.Now, we need to verify if this critical point is a maximum or a minimum. Let's test the derivative around u = √(29/5). Let's pick a value slightly less than √(29/5), say u = 2.4. Compute g'(2.4):First, compute √(u² -1) and √(7 - u²):u = 2.4u² = 5.76√(5.76 -1) = √4.76 ≈ 2.181√(7 -5.76) = √1.24 ≈ 1.113Then, g'(2.4) = (2*2.4)/2.181 - (2.4)/1.113 ≈ (4.8)/2.181 - 2.4/1.113 ≈ 2.2 - 2.157 ≈ 0.043 (positive)Now, take a value slightly more than √(29/5), say u = 2.41.u² ≈ 2.41² = 5.8081√(5.8081 -1) = √4.8081 ≈ 2.1927√(7 -5.8081) = √1.1919 ≈ 1.0917g'(2.41) = (2*2.41)/2.1927 - (2.41)/1.0917 ≈ 4.82 /2.1927 ≈ 2.197; 2.41 /1.0917 ≈ 2.207. So, 2.197 - 2.207 ≈ -0.01 (negative)So, the derivative changes from positive to negative as u increases through √(29/5). Therefore, this critical point is a local maximum. Therefore, the function g(u) has a maximum at u = √(29/5) and the minimum at the endpoints u=1 and u=√7, but wait, we need to check.Wait, when u approaches 1 from the right, what is the value? At u=1, g(u) = √6 ≈ 2.449. At u=√7, g(u)=2√6 ≈ 4.899. But we found a critical point at u≈2.408 where the function has a local maximum. Wait, but we need to check whether this critical point is indeed a maximum or if there's another behavior.Wait, let's compute g(u) at u=√(29/5):First, u² = 29/5, so u² -1 = 29/5 -5/5 = 24/5, so √(24/5) = (2√30)/5 ≈ 2.19097 - u² = 7 -29/5 = 35/5 -29/5 = 6/5, so √(6/5) = (√30)/5 ≈ 1.0954Then, g(u) = 2*(2√30)/5 + (√30)/5 = (4√30 + √30)/5 = (5√30)/5 = √30 ≈ 5.477Compare this with the endpoints:At u=1: g(1) = 2*0 + √(7 -1) = √6 ≈ 2.449At u=√7: g(√7) = 2√(7 -1) + 0 = 2√6 ≈ 4.899So, the function reaches a higher value at the critical point u=√(29/5) ≈2.408 with g(u)=√30≈5.477. Therefore, the maximum value is √30 and the minimum value is √6. But wait, but when u approaches √7, g(u) approaches 2√6 ≈4.899, which is less than √30≈5.477. Therefore, the maximum is indeed √30, and the minimum is √6. However, wait, but when u increases from 1 to √(29/5), the function increases from √6 to √30, then decreases from √30 to 2√6≈4.899. Therefore, the range of g(u) is [√6, √30]. But wait, 2√6 ≈4.899 and √30≈5.477. So, the maximum is √30 and the minimum is √6. Therefore, the range is [√6, √30].But let's verify this. Let me compute g(u) at the critical point and endpoints:At u=1: g(1)=√6≈2.449At u=√(29/5): g(u)=√30≈5.477At u=√7: g(√7)=2√6≈4.899Therefore, the function increases from √6 to √30, then decreases to 2√6. Therefore, the maximum is √30, and the minimum is √6. Therefore, the range is [√6, √30].But wait, but 2√6 is approximately 4.899, which is less than √30≈5.477, so the highest value is indeed √30 and the lowest is √6. So, the range of g(u) is [√6, √30]. Therefore, the range of the original function f(x) is [√6, √30].But let me double-check. Let's compute another point between u=√(29/5) and u=√7 to confirm the function is decreasing there. Let's take u=2.5, which is less than √7≈2.6458. Compute g(2.5):u=2.5u²=6.25First term: 2√(6.25 -1)=2√5.25≈2*2.2913≈4.5826Second term: √(7 -6.25)=√0.75≈0.8660Total g(2.5)=4.5826 +0.8660≈5.4486Compare with g(√(29/5))≈5.477. So, yes, at u=2.5, which is greater than √(29/5)=~2.408, the value is slightly less than the critical point. So, it's decreasing after the critical point. Similarly, check u=2.3:u=2.3u²=5.29First term:2√(5.29 -1)=2√4.29≈2*2.071≈4.142Second term:√(7 -5.29)=√1.71≈1.308Total≈4.142+1.308≈5.45, which is still slightly below √30≈5.477. Wait, but how precise is this? Let me compute √30 exactly. √30≈5.477225575. Let's compute g(u) at u=√(29/5):√(29/5)≈2.408, u²=29/5=5.8First term:2√(5.8 -1)=2√4.8≈2*2.19089≈4.38178Second term:√(7 -5.8)=√1.2≈1.0954Total≈4.38178 +1.0954≈5.47718, which is exactly √30. So, that's precise. Therefore, yes, at u=√(29/5), we get exactly √30.Therefore, the range is from √6 to √30. Therefore, the answer is [√6, √30]. But let me check the endpoints once again.At u=1: √6≈2.449At u=√7≈2.6458: 2√6≈4.899But since the function reaches up to √30≈5.477, which is higher than 2√6. Therefore, the maximum value is √30 and the minimum is √6.Therefore, the range of f(x) is [√6, √30].But just to be thorough, let's confirm with another point in the domain. Let's take x=2 - √7, which is approximately -0.6458. Compute f(x):f(x)=2√(x² -4x +3) +√(3 +4x -x²)Compute x² -4x +3:x=2 - √7x²=(2 - √7)^2=4 -4√7 +7=11 -4√7-4x= -4*(2 - √7)= -8 +4√7Therefore, x² -4x +3=(11 -4√7) + (-8 +4√7) +3= (11 -8 +3) + (-4√7 +4√7)=6 +0=6. So, √6. Then, first term is 2√6.Second term: √(3 +4x -x²). Compute 3 +4x -x²:3 +4*(2 - √7) - (11 -4√7)=3 +8 -4√7 -11 +4√7= (3+8-11) + (-4√7 +4√7)=0 +0=0. Therefore, the second term is √0=0. Therefore, f(x)=2√6 +0=2√6≈4.899.Wait, but x=2 - √7 is in the interval [2 - √7,1], so u=|x -2|=| -√7 | =√7. Wait, no. Wait, x=2 -√7, so x -2= -√7, so |x -2|=√7. But earlier, when we defined u=|x -2|, for x in [2 -√7,1], u ranges from [√7,1] but in reverse? Wait, hold on. Wait, x in [2 -√7,1], so x -2 ranges from -√7 to -1, so |x -2| ranges from √7 to1. But since x is going from 2 -√7 to1, which is moving from left to right, x -2 is from -√7 to -1, so |x -2| is decreasing from √7 to1. Therefore, u ∈ [1, √7] but in decreasing order. However, since u is just a parameter, the function g(u) is the same regardless of the direction of u. Therefore, when x is in [2 -√7,1], u goes from √7 to1, and when x is in [3,2 +√7], u goes from1 to√7. But since g(u) is the same expression, the range is the same. Therefore, the maximum occurs at u=√(29/5) regardless of the direction of u.But at x=2 -√7, which corresponds to u=√7, we have f(x)=2√6 +0=2√6, which is the same as when x=2 +√7 (the other endpoint). Wait, but earlier we saw that when x=2 +√7, then x -2=√7, so u=√7, and f(x)=2√( (√7)^2 -1 ) + √(7 - (√7)^2 )=2√(7 -1)+√(7 -7)=2√6 +0=2√6.Similarly, when x=1, which corresponds to u=1, f(x)=0 +√(7 -1)=√6. So, indeed, the minimum is √6 and the maximum is √30≈5.477.Therefore, the range of f(x) is [√6, √30].But let me check another point in the domain where u=√(29/5). Let's find x such that |x -2|=√(29/5). Since u can be achieved in both intervals [2 -√7,1] and [3,2 +√7].For the left interval [2 -√7,1], |x -2|=√(29/5) implies x -2= -√(29/5), so x=2 -√(29/5). Let's check if this x is in [2 -√7,1].Since √(29/5)=√5.8≈2.408, and 2 -2.408≈-0.408. But 2 -√7≈2 -2.6458≈-0.6458. So, -0.408 is greater than -0.6458, so x=2 -√(29/5)≈-0.408 is within [2 -√7,1] (-0.6458,1). Similarly, for the right interval [3,2 +√7], |x -2|=√(29/5) implies x=2 +√(29/5). Let's check if this x is in [3,2 +√7]. 2 +√(29/5)=2 +2.408≈4.408. And 2 +√7≈4.6458. So, 4.408 is within [3,4.6458]. Therefore, x=2 ±√(29/5) are both in the domain. Therefore, the maximum is achieved at these points.Therefore, the range of f(x) is [√6, √30]. So, the answer is [√6, √30]. But to present it in boxed notation as per the instruction, I need to write boxed{[sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]}.Final AnswerThe range of the function is boxed{[sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]}.</think>To find the range of the function ( f(x) = 2 sqrt{x^2 - 4x + 3} + sqrt{3 + 4x - x^2} ), we first determine the domain where both square roots are defined.1. Domain of the first square root ( sqrt{x^2 - 4x + 3} ):   - Solve ( x^2 - 4x + 3 geq 0 ). This factors to ( (x - 1)(x - 3) geq 0 ), giving the domain ( (-infty, 1] cup [3, infty) ).2. Domain of the second square root ( sqrt{3 + 4x - x^2} ):   - Solve ( 3 + 4x - x^2 geq 0 ). This factors to ( -(x^2 - 4x - 3) geq 0 ), giving the domain ( [2 - sqrt{7}, 2 + sqrt{7}] ).3. Intersection of domains:   - The intersection of ( (-infty, 1] cup [3, infty) ) and ( [2 - sqrt{7}, 2 + sqrt{7}] ) is ( [2 - sqrt{7}, 1] cup [3, 2 + sqrt{7}] ).Next, we analyze the function ( f(x) ) by substituting ( u = |x - 2| ), which simplifies the expressions inside the square roots:- For ( x in [2 - sqrt{7}, 1] cup [3, 2 + sqrt{7}] ), ( u ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( sqrt{7} ).- The function transforms to ( g(u) = 2sqrt{u^2 - 1} + sqrt{7 - u^2} ).To find the range of ( g(u) ):1. Critical points:   - Compute the derivative ( g'(u) ) and solve for critical points. We find a critical point at ( u = sqrt{frac{29}{5}} ).2. Evaluate ( g(u) ) at critical points and endpoints:   - At ( u = 1 ): ( g(1) = sqrt{6} ).   - At ( u = sqrt{7} ): ( g(sqrt{7}) = 2sqrt{6} ).   - At ( u = sqrt{frac{29}{5}} ): ( gleft(sqrt{frac{29}{5}}right) = sqrt{30} ).3. Determine the range:   - The maximum value is ( sqrt{30} ) and the minimum value is ( sqrt{6} ).Thus, the range of the function ( f(x) ) is (boxed{[sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]}).,<think>Okay, so I have this problem here: find the range of the function f(x) = 2√(x² - 4x + 3) + √(3 + 4x - x²). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, I remember that to find the range of a function, especially one involving square roots, I need to consider two things: the domain of the function (where it's defined) and then the possible values it can take on that domain. So, let's start with the domain.Looking at the function, there are two square roots. The expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number. So, let me set up the inequalities for each:1. For the first square root, √(x² - 4x + 3), the expression inside must be ≥ 0. So, x² - 4x + 3 ≥ 0.2. For the second square root, √(3 + 4x - x²), the expression inside must also be ≥ 0. So, 3 + 4x - x² ≥ 0.I need to solve these two inequalities to find the domain where both are satisfied.Starting with the first inequality: x² - 4x + 3 ≥ 0.Let me factor that quadratic. x² - 4x + 3. Let's see, factors of 3 that add up to -4... Hmm, -1 and -3. So, (x - 1)(x - 3) ≥ 0.So, the critical points are at x = 1 and x = 3. Testing intervals:- When x < 1, say x=0: (0 -1)(0 -3) = (-1)(-3) = 3 ≥ 0, which is true.- Between 1 and 3, say x=2: (2 -1)(2 -3) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0, which is false.- When x > 3, say x=4: (4 -1)(4 -3) = (3)(1) = 3 ≥ 0, which is true.So, the first inequality is satisfied when x ≤ 1 or x ≥ 3.Now the second inequality: 3 + 4x - x² ≥ 0.Let me rearrange that to make it easier: -x² + 4x + 3 ≥ 0. Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality): x² - 4x - 3 ≤ 0.Hmm, solving x² - 4x - 3 ≤ 0. Let's find the roots using the quadratic formula.x = [4 ± √(16 + 12)] / 2 = [4 ± √28]/2 = [4 ± 2√7]/2 = 2 ± √7.So, the roots are 2 + √7 ≈ 2 + 2.6458 ≈ 4.6458 and 2 - √7 ≈ 2 - 2.6458 ≈ -0.6458.Since the quadratic x² - 4x - 3 opens upwards (coefficient of x² is positive), the inequality x² - 4x - 3 ≤ 0 is satisfied between the roots. So, the solution is -0.6458 ≤ x ≤ 4.6458, or more precisely, [2 - √7, 2 + √7].So, combining both inequalities for the domain:From the first inequality: x ≤ 1 or x ≥ 3.From the second inequality: 2 - √7 ≤ x ≤ 2 + √7.Therefore, the domain of f(x) is the intersection of these two sets. So, let's find where they overlap.First, 2 - √7 is approximately -0.6458, and 2 + √7 is approximately 4.6458.So, the second inequality gives us x between approx -0.6458 and 4.6458.The first inequality says x ≤ 1 or x ≥ 3.Therefore, intersecting these:- The left part of the first inequality (x ≤ 1) intersects with the second inequality's left part (x ≥ -0.6458) to give x ∈ [-0.6458, 1].- The right part of the first inequality (x ≥ 3) intersects with the second inequality's right part (x ≤ 4.6458) to give x ∈ [3, 4.6458].So, the domain is [2 - √7, 1] ∪ [3, 2 + √7]. Since 2 - √7 ≈ -0.6458 and 2 + √7 ≈ 4.6458, these intervals are correct.Therefore, the function is defined on [2 - √7, 1] and [3, 2 + √7]. So, these are the intervals where both square roots are defined.Now, to find the range of f(x) on this domain. Hmm. The function is 2√(x² - 4x + 3) + √(3 + 4x - x²). Let's see if we can simplify these expressions inside the square roots.Starting with the first square root: x² - 4x + 3. Let's complete the square here.x² - 4x + 3 = (x² - 4x + 4) - 1 = (x - 2)² - 1.Similarly, the second square root: 3 + 4x - x². Let's rewrite that as -x² + 4x + 3. Completing the square:Factor out -1: - (x² - 4x - 3). Now complete the square inside:x² - 4x - 3 = (x² - 4x + 4) - 7 = (x - 2)^2 - 7.So, - ( (x - 2)^2 - 7 ) = - (x - 2)^2 + 7.Therefore, the second square root becomes √[ - (x - 2)^2 + 7 ].So, putting it all together:f(x) = 2√[(x - 2)^2 - 1] + √[7 - (x - 2)^2].Hmm, interesting. Let me note that. So, if I let t = x - 2, maybe substitution would help. Let me try that.Let t = x - 2. Then x = t + 2. Let's substitute into f(x):f(t) = 2√[(t)^2 - 1] + √[7 - t^2].But the domain in terms of t: original x is in [2 - √7, 1] ∪ [3, 2 + √7]. So, substituting x = t + 2:For x in [2 - √7, 1], t = x - 2 ∈ [2 - √7 - 2, 1 - 2] = [-√7, -1].For x in [3, 2 + √7], t = x - 2 ∈ [1, √7].So, t ∈ [-√7, -1] ∪ [1, √7].But let's check the expressions under the square roots:For the first term, √(t² - 1) is real when t² - 1 ≥ 0, which is |t| ≥ 1. So, t ≤ -1 or t ≥ 1. Which matches the domain we found. The second term, √(7 - t²) is real when 7 - t² ≥ 0, so t² ≤ 7, which is |t| ≤ √7. So, combining both, we have t ∈ [-√7, -1] ∪ [1, √7], which is exactly the domain.Therefore, f(t) = 2√(t² - 1) + √(7 - t²), where t ∈ [-√7, -1] ∪ [1, √7].But since t is squared in both expressions, and square roots are non-negative, the function f(t) will have the same value for t and -t. So, f(t) is even? Let me check:f(-t) = 2√((-t)^2 -1) + √(7 - (-t)^2) = 2√(t² -1) + √(7 - t²) = f(t). So, yes, it's even. Therefore, we can consider t ≥ 0, and then double the range? Wait, no. Because evenness implies symmetry, so the range for t in [1, √7] will be the same as for t in [-√7, -1]. So, to find the range, we can just consider t in [1, √7], since the function is even, and the values on the negative side will mirror those on the positive side. So, simplifying the problem.Therefore, let's redefine the problem as: find the range of f(t) = 2√(t² -1) + √(7 - t²) for t ∈ [1, √7].That seems manageable. Now, to find the range of this function, we can analyze its behavior over the interval [1, √7]. Maybe take derivatives to find critical points, check endpoints, etc.Let me first compute the function at the endpoints:At t = 1:f(1) = 2√(1 -1) + √(7 -1) = 2*0 + √6 = √6 ≈ 2.449.At t = √7 ≈ 2.6458:f(√7) = 2√(7 -1) + √(7 -7) = 2√6 + 0 = 2√6 ≈ 4.899.Now, we need to see if the function has any extrema between t=1 and t=√7. For that, let's take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero.First, compute f'(t):f(t) = 2√(t² -1) + √(7 - t²).So, derivative f’(t) = 2*(1/(2√(t² -1)))*(2t) + (1/(2√(7 - t²)))*(-2t).Wait, let me do that step by step.First term: 2√(t² -1). The derivative is 2*(1/(2√(t² -1)))*(2t). Wait, hold on. Wait, derivative of √u is (1/(2√u)) * u’.So, for the first term: d/dt [2√(t² -1)] = 2*(1/(2√(t² -1)))*(2t) = (2t)/√(t² -1).Wait, wait. Let's do it correctly:First term: 2√(t² -1). Let me denote this as 2*(t² -1)^{1/2}. The derivative is 2*(1/2)*(t² -1)^{-1/2}*(2t) = (2t)/√(t² -1).Second term: √(7 - t²) = (7 - t²)^{1/2}. The derivative is (1/2)*(7 - t²)^{-1/2}*(-2t) = (-t)/√(7 - t²).Therefore, f’(t) = (2t)/√(t² -1) - t/√(7 - t²).Set f’(t) = 0:(2t)/√(t² -1) - t/√(7 - t²) = 0.Factor out t:t [ 2/√(t² -1) - 1/√(7 - t²) ] = 0.Since t is in [1, √7], t ≥1, so t ≠ 0. Therefore, the equation reduces to:2/√(t² -1) - 1/√(7 - t²) = 0.So,2/√(t² -1) = 1/√(7 - t²).Cross-multiplying:2√(7 - t²) = √(t² -1).Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:4(7 - t²) = t² -1.Multiply out the left side:28 - 4t² = t² -1.Bring all terms to one side:28 +1 = 4t² + t².29 = 5t².Therefore, t² = 29/5, so t = √(29/5) ≈ √5.8 ≈ 2.408.But √(29/5) is approximately 2.408, and √7 ≈ 2.6458. So, this critical point is within the interval [1, √7], so it's valid.So, critical point at t = √(29/5). Let's check that.But let's write exact forms. 29/5 is 5.8. So, √(29/5) is equal to √(29)/√5, which is irrational but okay.So, now, we have three points to evaluate f(t) at: t=1, t=√(29/5), and t=√7.Wait, but before that, let me confirm that when we squared both sides, we didn't introduce extraneous solutions. Let's check the original equation at t = √(29/5):Left side: 2/√( (29/5) -1 ) = 2/√(24/5) = 2/( (2√6)/√5 ) = 2*(√5)/(2√6) ) = √5/√6 ≈ 0.9129.Right side: 1/√(7 - 29/5 ) = 1/√( (35 -29)/5 ) = 1/√(6/5 ) = √5/√6 ≈ 0.9129. So, they are equal. Therefore, the solution is valid.Therefore, the critical point is valid.So, now, compute f(t) at t=1, t=√(29/5), and t=√7.Already computed:At t=1: f(1)=√6 ≈ 2.449.At t=√7: f(√7)=2√6 ≈ 4.899.Now, compute at t=√(29/5):First, compute √(t² -1) where t² =29/5. So, t² -1 = 29/5 -1 = 24/5, so √(24/5)= (2√6)/√5.Similarly, 7 - t² =7 -29/5= (35 -29)/5=6/5, so √(6/5)=√6/√5.Therefore, f(t)=2*(2√6/√5) + (√6/√5)= (4√6 + √6)/√5=5√6/√5=√5*√6=√30≈5.477.Wait, hold on. Let me check that again.Wait, 2*(2√6/√5) is 4√6/√5. Then add √6/√5. So, 4√6/√5 + √6/√5 = 5√6/√5.Which is 5/√5 * √6 = √5 * √6 = √30. Because 5/√5 is √5. Yes, because 5 divided by √5 is √5. So, 5/√5 = √5. Therefore, 5√6/√5 = √5 * √6 = √30 ≈5.477.So, f(√(29/5)) = √30 ≈5.477.Therefore, the critical point at t=√(29/5) gives the maximum value of √30.So, putting this all together:The function f(t) on [1, √7] has a minimum at t=1 of √6, a maximum at t=√(29/5) of √30, and then decreases to 2√6 at t=√7. Wait, but 2√6 is approximately 4.899, which is less than √30≈5.477, so the maximum is indeed at the critical point.Therefore, the range of f(t) on [1, √7] is [√6, √30]. But since the function is even, the range over the entire domain [-√7, -1] ∪ [1, √7] is the same, since f(-t) = f(t). Therefore, the overall range of f(x) is [√6, √30].But wait, hold on. Wait, when t is in [1, √7], the function f(t) ranges from √6 to √30. However, when t is in [-√7, -1], since the function is even, it also ranges from √6 to √30. Therefore, combining both intervals, the range is still [√6, √30].But let me confirm. Let's check a point in the left interval. Take t=-1, then f(-1) = 2√(1 -1) + √(7 -1) = 0 + √6 = √6. Similarly, take t=-√(29/5), which is approximately -2.408, but since t must be in [-√7, -1], and √(29/5) ≈2.408 < √7≈2.645, so t=-√(29/5) is in [-√7, -1]. Then f(-√(29/5)) = 2√(29/5 -1) + √(7 -29/5) = same as before, √30. Therefore, yes, the range is from √6 to √30.Therefore, the range of f(x) is [√6, √30].But wait, let me check when t approaches √7 from below. For example, t=2.6, which is less than √7≈2.6458. Compute f(t):t=2.6, t²=6.76.First term: 2√(6.76 -1)=2√5.76=2*2.4=4.8.Second term: √(7 -6.76)=√0.24≈0.489.Total≈4.8+0.489≈5.289. Which is less than √30≈5.477. So, yes, the maximum is indeed at t=√(29/5)≈2.408.Wait, but when t increases from 1 to √7, the first term 2√(t² -1) increases, while the second term √(7 - t²) decreases. So, the function f(t) is a combination of an increasing and a decreasing function. Therefore, there should be a single maximum in between, which we found at t=√(29/5). Therefore, the maximum value is √30 and the minimum is √6.But hold on, at t=1, the function is √6, and as t increases, the function first increases to √30 and then decreases to 2√6≈4.899. Wait, 2√6 is approximately 4.899, which is greater than √6≈2.449 but less than √30≈5.477. Therefore, the minimum value is √6, achieved at t=1 and t=-1 (i.e., x=3 and x=1 in the original variable). The maximum is √30, achieved at t=±√(29/5), which corresponds to x=2±√(29/5). Let me verify that.Wait, original substitution: t = x - 2. So, x = t + 2. So, when t=√(29/5), x=2 + √(29/5). Similarly, t=-√(29/5) gives x=2 - √(29/5). Are these within the original domain?Original domain for x is [2 - √7,1] ∪ [3, 2 + √7]. Let's compute 2 + √(29/5). Since √(29/5) ≈2.408, so 2 + 2.408≈4.408, which is less than 2 + √7≈4.6458. Similarly, 2 - √(29/5)≈2 -2.408≈-0.408, which is greater than 2 - √7≈-0.6458. So, yes, both x=2 ±√(29/5) are within the domain intervals.Therefore, the conclusion is that the range of f(x) is [√6, √30].But let me just confirm once more. Let's take another point in the domain, say x=2 (which is in the original domain? Wait, x=2: check domain.Original domain is [2 - √7,1] ∪ [3,2 + √7]. 2 - √7 ≈-0.6458, so 2 is not in [ -0.6458,1] nor in [3,4.6458]. Therefore, x=2 is not in the domain. So, okay, can't check that.Alternatively, take x=4, which is in [3, 4.6458]. Then t=4 -2=2.Compute f(4)=2√(16 -16 +3) + √(3 +16 -16)=2√3 + √3=3√3≈5.196. Wait, 3√3≈5.196 is less than √30≈5.477, which is consistent with the maximum being √30. Similarly, take x=3.5. Then t=1.5.Compute f(3.5)=2√(12.25 -14 +3) + √(3 +14 -12.25)=2√(1.25) + √(4.75)=2*(≈1.118)+≈2.179≈2.236+2.179≈4.415, which is between √6 and √30.So, seems consistent. Therefore, the range is from √6 to √30.Hence, the answer is [√6, √30]. In boxed form, that would be boxed{[sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]}.Final AnswerThe range of the function is boxed{[sqrt{6}, sqrt{30}]}.</think>To find the range of the function ( f(x) = 2 sqrt{x^2 - 4x + 3} + sqrt{3 + 4x - x^2} ), we start by determining the domain where the function is defined. 1.

The function becomes:[f(t) = 2 sqrt{t^2 - 1} + sqrt{7 - t^2}]with ( t in [-sqrt{7}, -1] cup [1, sqrt{7}] ). Due to the evenness of the function, we consider ( t in [1, sqrt{7}] ).We evaluate the function at critical points:- At ( t = 1 ): ( f(1) = sqrt{6} )- At ( t = sqrt{7} ): ( f(sqrt{7}) = 2sqrt{6} )- Finding the critical point by setting the derivative ( f'(t) = 0 ):  [  frac{2t}{sqrt{t^2 - 1}} - frac{t}{sqrt{7 - t^2}} = 0 implies t = sqrt{frac{29}{5}}  ]  Evaluating at ( t = sqrt{frac{29}{5}} ): ( fleft(sqrt{frac{29}{5}}right) = sqrt{30} )Thus, the function ( f(t) ) ranges from ( sqrt{6} ) to ( sqrt{30} ) on ( [1, sqrt{7}] ).

I need to figure out which set of conditions can determine that quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one step by step.First, let's recall what defines a rectangle. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles, and it's also a parallelogram, meaning opposite sides are equal and parallel. Additionally, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. So, to prove a quadrilateral is a rectangle, we can either show that all angles are 90 degrees, or that it's a parallelogram with one right angle, or that it's a parallelogram with equal diagonals.Now let's look at the options:Option A: Angle A + Angle B = 90 degrees. Hmm. If the sum of angles A and B is 90, that might not be enough. In a quadrilateral, the sum of all angles should be 360 degrees. If A + B = 90, then C + D would have to be 270. That doesn't necessarily mean any of the angles are right angles. For example, maybe angle A is 30 and angle B is 60, then angle C and D could be 135 each. So that wouldn't make it a rectangle. So A is probably not the correct answer.Option B: AB parallel to CD, AB = CD, and AC = BD. Let's parse this. AB parallel to CD and AB = CD suggests that ABCD is a parallelogram because one pair of opposite sides is both parallel and equal. Then, in a parallelogram, if the diagonals are equal (AC = BD), that does imply it's a rectangle. Because in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, and if they are equal, then all angles must be right angles. So if a parallelogram has equal diagonals, it's a rectangle. So this seems like a possible correct answer. Let me remember that.Option C: AB parallel to CD, AD = BC, AC = BD. Wait, AB parallel to CD again. If AB is parallel to CD, but AD = BC. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if AB is parallel to CD, then if AD is equal to BC, but is that necessarily a parallelogram? Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and AD is equal to BC, then that might not necessarily mean it's a parallelogram. Wait, for example, in an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal. But in that case, AD and BC would be the legs, which are equal. However, in an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are also equal. So if AB is parallel to CD, AD = BC, and diagonals equal, then that would be an isosceles trapezoid, not necessarily a rectangle. Wait, but the problem says quadrilateral ABCD. So if AB is parallel to CD, and AD equals BC, but also diagonals are equal, then maybe that would make it a rectangle? Wait, no. In an isosceles trapezoid, diagonals are equal. So if you have AB parallel to CD, AD = BC, and AC = BD, then it could be an isosceles trapezoid. But is there a case where it's not a rectangle? Wait, in a rectangle, both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, but in an isosceles trapezoid, only one pair is parallel. So if AB is parallel to CD, but maybe AD is not parallel to BC. So if you have AB || CD, AD = BC, and AC = BD, could it be a rectangle? If ABCD has AB || CD and AD || BC, then it's a parallelogram. If it's a parallelogram with equal diagonals, then it's a rectangle. But in option C, it only states AB || CD and AD = BC. So if AB || CD, but AD is not necessarily parallel to BC, then it's not necessarily a parallelogram. For example, it could be an isosceles trapezoid. So in that case, even with AC = BD, since isosceles trapezoid already has equal diagonals, so that would satisfy the conditions. So this might not uniquely determine a rectangle. So maybe option C is not correct.Option D: AC = BD, angle A = 90 degrees. If diagonals are equal and one angle is 90 degrees, does that make it a rectangle? Let's think. Suppose you have quadrilateral ABCD with AC = BD and angle A is 90 degrees. Let me try to imagine. If angle A is 90 degrees, but if the quadrilateral isn't a parallelogram, then even with diagonals equal, it might not be a rectangle. For example, you could have a quadrilateral where angle A is 90, and diagonals are equal, but the other angles aren't 90. Wait, how? Let me think. If we have a quadrilateral where angle A is right, and diagonals are equal. Maybe it's a rectangle, maybe not. For example, take a square, which is a rectangle, diagonals are equal and angles are 90. But if I take another quadrilateral, let's say, ABCD with angle A = 90, diagonals AC and BD equal. Suppose sides AB and AD are not equal. Then, if diagonals are equal, but the other angles are not 90. For example, suppose AB is longer than AD. Maybe it's a rectangle, but maybe not. Wait, no. If angle A is 90, and diagonals are equal. Hmm. Let me think in terms of coordinates. Let me set coordinates to model this.Let’s place point A at (0, 0). Since angle A is 90 degrees, sides AB and AD are perpendicular. Let's say AB is along the x-axis and AD is along the y-axis. Let AB = a, AD = b. Then, point B is (a, 0), point D is (0, b). Then point C can be determined based on the rest of the quadrilateral. Since diagonals AC and BD are equal. The diagonal AC goes from (0, 0) to (x, y), which is point C. The diagonal BD goes from (a, 0) to (0, b). The length of BD is sqrt(a² + b²). The length of AC is sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2). So if AC = BD, then sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(a² + b²), so x² + y² = a² + b². However, point C is determined by the sides BC and CD. Wait, but since we don't know if ABCD is a parallelogram, BC and CD could be anything. For example, suppose AB is (a, 0), AD is (0, b). Then, if ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB and AD as sides, then point C is (a, b) if it's a rectangle. But if it's not a rectangle, point C could be elsewhere. For example, if we have a kite shape. Wait, but angle at A is 90. Hmm. Wait, maybe another example. Let me choose specific numbers. Let’s set a = 3, b = 4. Then BD length is 5. So AC must also be 5. Let’s suppose point C is at (3, 4), so AC is 5. Then ABCD is a rectangle. But suppose point C is at (5, 0). Then AC would be 5, which equals BD. But angle at A is 90, but point C is (5, 0). Then ABCD would have points A(0,0), B(3,0), C(5,0), D(0,4). Wait, but angle at D would not be 90. In this case, the quadrilateral is not a rectangle. So even with diagonals equal and angle A = 90, it's not necessarily a rectangle. So option D might not be correct.So, going back:A: Not sufficient, as angles could be other than 90.B: AB parallel and equal to CD (so it's a parallelogram), and diagonals equal. Parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle. So B is correct.C: AB parallel to CD, AD = BC, diagonals equal. This might be an isosceles trapezoid, which also has equal diagonals, so not necessarily a rectangle.D: Diagonals equal and one right angle. Not necessarily a rectangle, as shown by example.Therefore, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>To determine which set of conditions can determine that quadrilateral (ABCD) is a rectangle, we need to recall the properties of a rectangle: it is a parallelogram with four right angles and equal diagonals.Option A: (angle A + angle B = 90^circ)  This condition is insufficient because the sum of angles (A) and (B) being (90^circ) does not necessarily imply that all angles are right angles. For example, angles (A) and (B) could be (30^circ) and (60^circ) respectively, leaving the other angles to sum to (270^circ), which does not form a rectangle.Option B: (AB parallel CD), (AB = CD), (AC = BD)  This condition states that (ABCD) is a parallelogram (since (AB parallel CD) and (AB = CD)) with equal diagonals. A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle. Therefore, this condition is sufficient.Option C: (AB parallel CD), (AD = BC), (AC = BD)  This could describe an isosceles trapezoid, which has one pair of parallel sides, equal non-parallel sides, and equal diagonals. An isosceles trapezoid is not necessarily a rectangle, so this condition is insufficient.Option D: (AC = BD), (angle A = 90^circ)  While a rectangle has equal diagonals and a right angle, this condition alone does not ensure the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. For example, a quadrilateral with a right angle and equal diagonals can be constructed without all angles being right angles, thus not forming a rectangle.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).,<think>Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given conditions (A, B, C, D) can determine that quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. Let me go through each option one by one and analyze them. Starting with Option A: ∠A + ∠B = 90°. Hmm, in a quadrilateral, the sum of all four angles is 360°. If ∠A + ∠B = 90°, then the remaining two angles ∠C + ∠D would have to be 270°. But in a rectangle, all angles are 90°, so each pair of adjacent angles should add up to 180°, right? Because in a rectangle, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, so if ∠A + ∠B = 90°, that's way less than 180°, so this can't be a rectangle. So Option A seems impossible for a rectangle. Therefore, A is out.Moving on to Option B: AB is parallel to CD, AB equals CD, and the diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let me recall that if a quadrilateral has both pairs of opposite sides parallel and equal, it's a parallelogram. Then, if the diagonals are equal in a parallelogram, that makes it a rectangle. So, if AB is parallel and equal to CD, that's one pair of sides. Wait, but does the problem mention the other pair? Like, AD and BC? If AB is parallel and equal to CD, and if we also have the diagonals equal, then yes, in a parallelogram, equal diagonals imply it's a rectangle. But wait, the problem states AB parallel to CD, AB equals CD, and diagonals AC and BD equal. So, if AB is parallel and equal to CD, but we don't know about the other pair of sides. Wait, but in a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal. If only one pair is given, then it's a trapezoid. Wait, no. If a quadrilateral has one pair of sides that are both parallel and equal, then it is a parallelogram. Wait, yes, I think that's a theorem. If one pair of sides is both parallel and equal, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So in Option B, AB parallel to CD and AB equals CD makes it a parallelogram. Then, in a parallelogram, if the diagonals are equal, then it's a rectangle. So yes, that should work. So Option B seems valid. Let me just verify. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and diagonals bisect each other. If the diagonals are equal, then all angles must be right angles, hence a rectangle. So B is a correct condition.Option C: AB parallel to CD, AD equals BC, and AC equals BD. Let's see. AB is parallel to CD. So again, if AB is parallel to CD, and if AD equals BC, which are the other pair of sides. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so AD should equal BC if it's a parallelogram, but if AB is only given as parallel to CD, and AD equals BC, is that enough to make it a parallelogram? Let me think. Suppose we have AB parallel to CD, and AD equals BC. But if AB is parallel to CD, and AD equals BC, does that make it a parallelogram? Not necessarily. For example, in an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal, right? So in an isosceles trapezoid, you have one pair of sides parallel (AB and CD), and the other pair of sides (AD and BC) equal. So if you have AB parallel to CD and AD equals BC, it could be an isosceles trapezoid. Then, if the diagonals are equal (AC = BD), but in an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are also equal. So this would satisfy all the conditions of Option C, but the shape would be an isosceles trapezoid, not a rectangle. Therefore, Option C is not sufficient to determine that the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Because both rectangles and isosceles trapezoids can satisfy those conditions. So C is not the answer.Option D: AC equals BD, and angle A is 90°. So the diagonals are equal and one angle is 90°. Let me think. If a quadrilateral has equal diagonals and one right angle, does that make it a rectangle? Hmm. Let's consider. For example, take a quadrilateral where angle A is 90°, and diagonals AC and BD are equal. Could this be a rectangle? Well, in a rectangle, all angles are 90°, and diagonals are equal. But does having one right angle and equal diagonals force the other angles to be right angles?Let me try to sketch such a quadrilateral. Suppose angle A is 90°, and diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let me imagine a quadrilateral ABCD with right angle at A, but maybe not at B, C, or D. For instance, if ABCD is a rectangle, then yes, but maybe there's another quadrilateral where angle A is 90°, diagonals are equal, but it's not a rectangle. For example, take a kite with one right angle. Wait, but in a kite, diagonals are not equal unless it's a square. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a trapezoid with angle A being 90°, and diagonals equal. For instance, a right trapezoid (with two adjacent right angles) might have equal diagonals. Let's see. Suppose we have a right trapezoid ABCD, with AB and CD parallel, angle A and angle D are right angles. If the legs AD and BC are of different lengths, but can the diagonals still be equal?Wait, in a right trapezoid, the diagonals can be equal. Let's see. Suppose AD is vertical, AB is horizontal, CD is parallel to AB, and BC is slanting. The diagonals AC and BD. Let me assign coordinates. Let A be at (0,0), D at (0, a), B at (b,0), and C at (c, a). Then, AC is from (0,0) to (c,a), length sqrt(c² + a²). BD is from (b,0) to (0,a), length sqrt(b² + a²). So for the diagonals to be equal, sqrt(c² + a²) = sqrt(b² + a²), so c² = b². Therefore, c = ±b. But since CD is parallel to AB, which is along the x-axis, then CD must also be horizontal. So if AB is from (0,0) to (b,0), then CD is from (c,a) to (d,a). Since CD is parallel to AB, which is horizontal, so CD must have the same y-coordinate, which it does. The length of CD is |d - c|. Since AB has length b. If it's a trapezoid, then AB and CD are the two bases. But in a right trapezoid, only one of the legs is perpendicular. So in this case, AD is perpendicular, but BC is not.But if we set c = b, then point C is at (b, a). Then CD would be from (b, a) to (d, a), so the length is |d - b|. If we set d = 0, then CD would be from (b, a) to (0, a), length b. Then AB is from (0,0) to (b,0), length b. So it would be a rectangle. Wait, but in this case, if c = b and d = 0, then point C is (b, a), and D is (0, a). Then ABCD would have coordinates A(0,0), B(b,0), C(b,a), D(0,a), which is a rectangle. But if c = -b, then point C is (-b, a), and CD would be from (-b, a) to (d, a). If we set d = something else, maybe. Let's say c = -b and d = something. Then CD length is |d - (-b)| = |d + b|. AB length is b. If we want CD to not be equal to AB, then set d + b ≠ b, so d ≠ 0. For example, let d = e, so CD length is |e + b|. Then, in this case, ABCD would have coordinates A(0,0), B(b,0), C(-b,a), D(e,a). Then, angle at A is 90°, diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let's check diagonals. AC is from (0,0) to (-b,a), length sqrt(b² + a²). BD is from (b,0) to (e,a), length sqrt((e - b)² + a²). For diagonals to be equal, sqrt((e - b)^2 + a²) = sqrt(b² + a²). Squaring both sides: (e - b)^2 + a² = b² + a² ⇒ (e - b)^2 = b² ⇒ e - b = ±b ⇒ e = b ± b ⇒ e = 2b or e = 0. If e = 2b, then point D is (2b, a). Then CD is from (-b,a) to (2b,a), length 3b. AB is length b. Then this would be a trapezoid with AB parallel to CD, but CD longer. However, in this case, angle at D would be angle between AD and CD. AD is from (0,0) to (2b,a), so that's a diagonal, not vertical. Wait, no. Wait, in my coordinate system, point D is (e,a). Wait, if e = 2b, then D is (2b, a). But in that case, AD is from (0,0) to (2b, a), which is a diagonal. Wait, but angle at A is between AB and AD. AB is along the x-axis, AD is from (0,0) to (2b, a). So angle at A is between AB (x-axis) and AD (slanted), which is 90°, but in this case, if AD is from (0,0) to (2b, a), the slope is a/(2b). For angle A to be 90°, AD must be vertical, but in this case, it's not. Wait, hold on, in my previous setup, angle A is 90°, which in the problem statement is given. So angle A is 90°, so AD must be perpendicular to AB. If AB is horizontal, then AD must be vertical. Therefore, in the coordinates, if AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (b,0), then AD must be along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0, a). Then, point D is (0, a). Then, if diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let's assign coordinates correctly with angle A being 90°.Let me redo the coordinate system properly. Let’s place point A at (0,0). Since angle A is 90°, sides AB and AD are perpendicular. Let’s let AB be along the x-axis to (b,0), and AD along the y-axis to (0,a). So points: A(0,0), B(b,0), D(0,a). Now, point C is somewhere. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the order is important. So ABCD connects A to B to C to D to A. So if AB is from (0,0) to (b,0), BC is from (b,0) to C, which is connected to D(0,a). Now, the diagonals AC and BD. Diagonal AC is from (0,0) to C, and BD is from (b,0) to (0,a). The problem states that diagonals AC and BD are equal. So let's find coordinates of C such that AC = BD.First, BD is from (b,0) to (0,a). The length of BD is sqrt(b² + a²). AC is from (0,0) to (x,y), which is point C. The length of AC is sqrt(x² + y²). For them to be equal, sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(b² + a²), so x² + y² = b² + a².But point C is determined by the quadrilateral. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So BC connects B(b,0) to C, and CD connects C to D(0,a). Now, if we don't have any other conditions, there are infinitely many points C such that AC = BD. But we need to see if such a quadrilateral with angle A = 90° and AC = BD must be a rectangle.But in a rectangle, all angles are 90°, and point C would be at (b,a). Then, AC would be the diagonal from (0,0) to (b,a), length sqrt(b² + a²), same as BD. So in that case, it's a rectangle.But can we have another quadrilateral where angle A is 90°, diagonals AC and BD are equal, but it's not a rectangle? Let's see. Suppose point C is not at (b,a). Let's say C is at (c,d), such that sqrt(c² + d²) = sqrt(b² + a²). So c² + d² = b² + a². But point C must also connect to D(0,a). So CD is from (c,d) to (0,a). The coordinates must satisfy that. Also, BC is from (b,0) to (c,d). So unless c = b and d = a, which makes it a rectangle, there might be other possibilities.For example, suppose b = a = 1 for simplicity. Then BD length is sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Then AC must also be sqrt(2). Let's place point C somewhere on the circle of radius sqrt(2) centered at A(0,0). Let me pick a point C not at (1,1). For example, C could be at (sqrt(2), 0), but then CD would be from (sqrt(2),0) to (0,1). But then BC is from (1,0) to (sqrt(2),0), which is along the x-axis, and CD is from (sqrt(2),0) to (0,1). But angle at C would be something, but does angle A being 90° and diagonals equal make it a rectangle? Wait, but in this case, if AB is (0,0) to (1,0), AD is (0,0) to (0,1), and C is (sqrt(2),0). Then, BD is from (1,0) to (0,1), which is length sqrt(2). AC is from (0,0) to (sqrt(2),0), which is length sqrt(2). So diagonals are equal. But the quadrilateral is A(0,0), B(1,0), C(sqrt(2),0), D(0,1). But connecting D to C would be from (0,1) to (sqrt(2),0), which is a diagonal. However, in this case, the quadrilateral is not a rectangle because point C is colinear with B on the x-axis, making BC and AB part of the same line, which actually might not be a simple quadrilateral. Wait, no. If points are A(0,0), B(1,0), C(sqrt(2),0), D(0,1), then connecting them in order would make ABCD with sides AB: (0,0)-(1,0), BC: (1,0)-(sqrt(2),0), CD: (sqrt(2),0)-(0,1), DA: (0,1)-(0,0). But in this case, CD is a diagonal line from (sqrt(2),0) to (0,1), and DA is vertical. This is a quadrilateral, but it's definitely not a rectangle. Moreover, angle at A is 90°, diagonals AC and BD are equal (sqrt(2)), but it's not a rectangle. Therefore, Option D is not sufficient to determine that the quadrilateral is a rectangle. So D is out.So, summarizing:- A: Doesn't work because angle sum is wrong.- B: Works because it defines a parallelogram with equal diagonals, which is a rectangle.- C: Doesn't work because it could be an isosceles trapezoid.- D: Doesn't work because you can have a non-rectangle with equal diagonals and one right angle.Therefore, the correct answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>To determine which set of conditions can determine that quadrilateral (ABCD) is a rectangle, we analyze each option:- Option A: (angle A + angle B = 90^circ). In a rectangle, consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to (180^circ)). This condition is insufficient as it implies the other two angles sum to (270^circ), which is impossible for a rectangle. Thus, A is incorrect.- Option B: (AB parallel CD), (AB = CD), (AC = BD). If (AB parallel CD) and (AB = CD), the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, equal diagonals ((AC = BD)) imply it is a rectangle. Thus, B is correct.- Option C: (AB parallel CD), (AD = BC), (AC = BD). This could describe an isosceles trapezoid (where non-parallel sides are equal and diagonals are equal) rather than a rectangle. Thus, C is incorrect.- Option D: (AC = BD), (angle A = 90^circ). A quadrilateral with equal diagonals and one right angle can be constructed without all angles being (90^circ). An example is a right trapezoid with equal diagonals. Thus, D is incorrect.The correct answer is (boxed{B}).]"},{"problem":"Given f(x) = (x+1)(x+a) is an even function, then a = （　　）A: -2B: -1C: 1D: 2","solution":"Since the function is an even function, we have f(1) = f(-1).

Analysis: Because the function is an even function, according to the definition of even functions, which is f(-x) = f(x), we can solve the equation to find a.","generations":"[<think>Okay, so I need to figure out the value of 'a' such that the function f(x) = (x+1)(x+a) is an even function. The options given are A: -2, B: -1, C: 1, D: 2. Let me start by recalling what an even function is. An even function satisfies the condition f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain. That means if I substitute -x into the function, it should be equal to the original function. First, let me write down the function again: f(x) = (x + 1)(x + a). Maybe I should expand this function to make it easier to compare f(x) and f(-x). Let's do that. Expanding (x + 1)(x + a) gives x² + ax + x + a. Combining like terms, that's x² + (a + 1)x + a. So f(x) = x² + (a + 1)x + a.Now, let's compute f(-x). To do that, substitute -x wherever there's an x in the function. So f(-x) = (-x)² + (a + 1)(-x) + a. Calculating each term: (-x)² is x², (a + 1)(-x) is - (a + 1)x, and the constant term is still a. Therefore, f(-x) = x² - (a + 1)x + a.Since f(x) is supposed to be even, f(x) must equal f(-x) for all x. That means:x² + (a + 1)x + a = x² - (a + 1)x + a.If I subtract x² and a from both sides, the equation simplifies to:(a + 1)x = - (a + 1)x.So, (a + 1)x + (a + 1)x = 0.Which simplifies to 2(a + 1)x = 0.This equation must hold true for all x in the domain of the function. The only way this can be true for all x is if the coefficient of x is zero. That is, 2(a + 1) = 0. Solving for a:2(a + 1) = 0  Divide both sides by 2: a + 1 = 0  Subtract 1 from both sides: a = -1.Wait, so according to this, a = -1. Let me check if that makes sense. Let me substitute a = -1 back into the original function and see if it becomes even.Original function: f(x) = (x + 1)(x + a). If a = -1, then f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1). That simplifies to x² - 1. Now, let's check if that's even. f(-x) = (-x)² - 1 = x² - 1, which is equal to f(x). So yes, when a = -1, the function becomes f(x) = x² - 1, which is indeed even. Therefore, the answer should be B: -1.But wait, let me cross-verify this another way in case I made a mistake. Let me check the original function without expanding. If f(x) is even, then (x + 1)(x + a) must equal (-x + 1)(-x + a). Let's set them equal:(x + 1)(x + a) = (-x + 1)(-x + a).Let me expand both sides to see if that gives the same result.Left side: x² + (a + 1)x + a (as before).Right side: (-x + 1)(-x + a). Multiply the two binomials:First term: (-x)(-x) = x²  Outer term: (-x)(a) = -a x  Inner term: (1)(-x) = -x  Last term: (1)(a) = a  Combine these: x² - a x - x + a = x² - (a + 1)x + a.Which is the same as the left side expansion: x² + (a + 1)x + a. Therefore, setting them equal gives:x² + (a + 1)x + a = x² - (a + 1)x + a.As before, subtracting x² and a from both sides gives (a + 1)x = - (a + 1)x, leading to 2(a + 1)x = 0. So indeed, the coefficient must be zero, so a + 1 = 0, which gives a = -1.Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. For the function to be even, it has to be symmetric about the y-axis. The given function is a quadratic. A quadratic function is a parabola. For a quadratic function to be even, it must be symmetric about the y-axis, which means its axis of symmetry is the y-axis (x = 0). The standard form of a quadratic is f(x) = ax² + bx + c, and its axis of symmetry is at x = -b/(2a). Wait, in our case, the quadratic is already given. Let's write the expanded form again: f(x) = x² + (a + 1)x + a. So here, the coefficient of x² is 1, coefficient of x is (a + 1), and the constant term is a. For the axis of symmetry to be x = 0, the formula -b/(2a) would be - (a + 1)/(2*1) = - (a + 1)/2. Setting this equal to 0 gives:- (a + 1)/2 = 0  Multiply both sides by 2: - (a + 1) = 0  Therefore, a + 1 = 0  Thus, a = -1.So that's another way to see it. The axis of symmetry must be at x = 0, so solving for a gives a = -1.This corroborates the previous result. So regardless of the method, expanding and equating coefficients, or considering the axis of symmetry, we arrive at a = -1. Therefore, the answer is B: -1.But wait, just to be thorough, let me check what happens if I plug in the other options. Let's see:If a was -2 (option A), then f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2) = x² - 2x + x - 2 = x² - x - 2. Then f(-x) = (-x)^2 - (-x) - 2 = x² + x - 2. Comparing f(x) and f(-x): x² - x - 2 vs. x² + x - 2. These are not the same because the linear terms have opposite coefficients. So f(-x) ≠ f(x), so a = -2 is not correct.If a was 1 (option C), then f(x) = (x + 1)(x + 1) = (x + 1)^2 = x² + 2x + 1. Then f(-x) = (-x + 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Comparing f(x) = x² + 2x +1 and f(-x) = x² -2x +1, they are not equal because of the middle term. Hence a = 1 is incorrect.If a was 2 (option D), then f(x) = (x + 1)(x + 2) = x² + 2x + x + 2 = x² + 3x + 2. Then f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 3*(-x) + 2 = x² -3x +2. Comparing to f(x) = x² +3x +2, again the linear terms differ, so not equal. Therefore a =2 is incorrect.So only when a = -1 does the function become even. Therefore, the correct answer is B: -1.Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognize that an even function satisfies f(x) = f(-x) for all x.2. Expand the given function f(x) and compute f(-x).3. Set them equal and compare coefficients.4. Solve for a, which gives a = -1.5. Verify by plugging a = -1 back into the original function and confirming it's even.6. Check other options to ensure they don't work, which they don't.Therefore, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given the function ( f(x) = (x+1)(x+a) ) is an even function, we need to find the value of ( a ).An even function satisfies the condition ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for all ( x ).First, we expand the given function:[f(x) = (x+1)(x+a) = x^2 + (a+1)x + a]Next, we compute ( f(-x) ):[f(-x) = (-x+1)(-x+a) = (-x)^2 + (a+1)(-x) + a = x^2 - (a+1)x + a]For ( f(x) ) to be even, we set ( f(x) = f(-x) ):[x^2 + (a+1)x + a = x^2 - (a+1)x + a]Subtracting ( x^2 ) and ( a ) from both sides, we get:[(a+1)x = - (a+1)x]This simplifies to:[2(a+1)x = 0]For this equation to hold for all ( x ), the coefficient must be zero:[2(a+1) = 0 implies a+1 = 0 implies a = -1]Verification by substituting ( a = -1 ) back into the original function:[f(x) = (x+1)(x-1) = x^2 - 1]This is indeed an even function since ( f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 1 = x^2 - 1 = f(x) ).Checking other options confirms they do not satisfy the even function condition. Thus, the correct answer is:[boxed{B}],<think>Okay, let's see. The problem says that the function f(x) = (x + 1)(x + a) is an even function, and we need to find the value of a from the options given. Alright, let's start by recalling what an even function is. An even function satisfies the condition f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain. So, that means if I plug in -x into the function, it should be the same as the original function. Let me write down the function again: f(x) = (x + 1)(x + a). Let's expand this first to make it easier to handle. Multiplying the two binomials, we get:f(x) = x^2 + (a + 1)x + aOkay, so expanded, it's a quadratic function. Now, for this function to be even, it has to satisfy f(x) = f(-x). Let's compute f(-x) and set it equal to f(x), then solve for a.First, compute f(-x):f(-x) = (-x + 1)(-x + a)Let me expand that as well:First, multiply the terms: (-x + 1)(-x + a) = (-x)(-x) + (-x)(a) + 1*(-x) + 1*aCalculating each term:(-x)(-x) = x^2(-x)(a) = -a x1*(-x) = -x1*a = aSo, combining all these terms:x^2 - a x - x + a = x^2 - (a + 1)x + aSo, f(-x) = x^2 - (a + 1)x + aNow, set f(x) equal to f(-x):Original f(x): x^2 + (a + 1)x + af(-x): x^2 - (a + 1)x + aSet them equal:x^2 + (a + 1)x + a = x^2 - (a + 1)x + aSubtract x^2 and a from both sides to simplify:(a + 1)x = - (a + 1)xBring all terms to one side:(a + 1)x + (a + 1)x = 0Combine like terms:2(a + 1)x = 0Now, this equation must hold true for all x in the domain of f. Since the equation is 2(a + 1)x = 0 for all x, the only way this can be true is if the coefficient of x is zero. That is:2(a + 1) = 0Divide both sides by 2:a + 1 = 0Therefore, solving for a gives:a = -1Hmm, so according to this, the answer is B: -1. Let me check if that makes sense. If a is -1, then the original function becomes f(x) = (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1. Which is indeed an even function because f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 1 = x^2 - 1 = f(x). So that works out. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in expanding the original function. Let's check again:f(x) = (x + 1)(x + a) = x^2 + a x + x + a = x^2 + (a + 1)x + a. That's correct.Then f(-x) = (-x + 1)(-x + a). Let's compute this again step by step:First, (-x + 1) times (-x + a). Multiply term by term:First term: (-x)*(-x) = x^2Outer term: (-x)*a = -a xInner term: 1*(-x) = -xLast term: 1*a = aCombine: x^2 -a x -x + a = x^2 - (a + 1)x + a. Correct.Set equal to original f(x): x^2 + (a + 1)x + a = x^2 - (a + 1)x + aSubtract x^2 and a: (a +1)x = - (a +1)xThen (a +1)x + (a +1)x = 0 => 2(a +1)x = 0Therefore, coefficient must be zero: 2(a +1) =0 => a= -1. So yes, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is B: -1.But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A: -2, B: -1, C: 1, D: 2. So B is -1, which is our answer. So I think that's correct.Alternatively, another way to think about even functions is that they are symmetric about the y-axis. So, if the function is even, then all the exponents of x must be even. However, in this case, the original function is a quadratic. Wait, but quadratic functions are not necessarily even unless their linear term is zero. Since the quadratic term is x^2, which is even, but the linear term is (a +1)x. For the entire function to be even, the linear term must be zero. Therefore, (a +1)x must be zero for all x, which again implies that a +1 =0, so a = -1. That's another way to see it.Yes, so in a quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c, the function is even if and only if the coefficient of the x term (b) is zero. So in our case, the coefficient is (a +1), so we set that to zero. Therefore, a = -1.So, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}</think>Given the function ( f(x) = (x+1)(x+a) ) is an even function, we need to find the value of ( a ).An even function satisfies the condition ( f(x) = f(-x) ) for all ( x ).
