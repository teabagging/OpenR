So, we have a line that passes through two points: (2023, 0) and (-2021, 2024). We need to find the value of c such that this line also passes through the point (1, c). First, I remember that to find the equation of a line when given two points, we can use the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form. But maybe the first step is to calculate the slope of the line. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me write that down.So, let&#39;s assign the points. Let&#39;s say point 1 is (2023, 0), so x1 = 2023, y1 = 0. Point 2 is (-2021, 2024), so x2 = -2021, y2 = 2024. Now, plugging into the slope formula: slope m = (2024 - 0)/(-2021 - 2023). That simplifies to 2024 divided by (-2021 - 2023). Let me compute the denominator: -2021 -2023. Hmm, that&#39;s like -(2021 + 2023). What&#39;s 2021 + 2023? Well, 2020 + 2020 is 4040, so 2021 + 2023 is 4044? Wait, no. Let me check: 2021 + 2023. 2021 + 2023 is 2021 + 2020 + 3 = 4041 + 3 = 4044? Wait, 2021 + 2023. 2021 + 2000 is 4021, then +23 is 4044. Yeah, so 2021 + 2023 = 4044. So the denominator is -4044. So the slope m is 2024 / (-4044). Let me simplify that fraction.First, see if both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4. 2024 divided by 4 is 506, and 4044 divided by 4 is 1011. So, m = -506/1011. Wait, is that reducible? Let me check if 506 and 1011 have any common factors. 506 divided by 2 is 253, which is a prime number? 253 is 11*23, right? 11*23 is 253. Let me check 11*23: 11*20=220, 11*3=33, so 220+33=253. Yes. So 506 is 2*11*23. Now, 1011 divided by 2 is 505.5, so not divisible by 2. Let&#39;s check 11: 1011 divided by 11. 11*91=1001, so 1011 - 1001=10, so remainder 10. Not divisible by 11. How about 23? 23*43=989, 23*44=1012, which is 1 more than 1011, so 23*43=989, 1011-989=22, so remainder 22. So not divisible by 23. So the fraction -506/1011 reduces to -253/505.5? Wait, no, that was after dividing numerator and denominator by 2. Wait, original fraction was 2024/-4044, which simplifies to 2024 divided by -4044. Let me check GCD of 2024 and 4044.Find GCD(2024, 4044). Let&#39;s apply the Euclidean algorithm. 4044 divided by 2024 is 1 with remainder 2020 (since 2024*1=2024, 4044-2024=2020). Then GCD(2024, 2020). 2024 divided by 2020 is 1 with remainder 4. Then GCD(2020, 4). 2020 divided by 4 is 505 with remainder 0. So GCD is 4. Therefore, 2024 and 4044 have GCD 4. Therefore, 2024/4044 reduces to 2024/4 = 506, and 4044/4 = 1011. So the simplified fraction is 506/1011, so with the negative sign, m = -506/1011. Wait, but 506 and 1011, as we saw earlier, GCD is 2? Wait, 506 is 2*253, and 1011 is 2*505.5? Wait, 1011 is odd. Wait, 1011 divided by 3 is 337, because 3*337=1011. Let me check: 3*300=900, 3*37=111, so 900+111=1011. Yes. So 1011=3*337. And 506 is 2*253. 253 is 11*23. So, GCD of 506 and 1011 is 1? Because 506 is 2*11*23, and 1011 is 3*337. Since 337 is a prime number (I think), and none of the primes in 506 are in 1011. So GCD is 1. Therefore, the slope is -506/1011, which cannot be simplified further. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The slope is (2024 - 0)/(-2021 - 2023). So 2024 divided by (-2021 -2023). Wait, -2021 -2023 is - (2021 + 2023). 2021 + 2023: 2021 + 2023. Since 2021 + 2023 = (2020 +1) + (2020 +3) = 2020*2 + 4 = 4040 +4=4044. So, the denominator is -4044. So, slope is 2024 / (-4044). Which reduces to -2024/4044. Then, as GCD is 4, divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2024/4=506, 4044/4=1011. So, slope is -506/1011. As 506 and 1011 have no common factors, that&#39;s the simplified form.Okay, so slope m = -506/1011. Now, with the slope known, we can write the equation of the line using point-slope form. Let&#39;s pick one of the points. Let&#39;s choose (2023, 0) since the numbers might be easier. Point-slope formula: y - y1 = m(x - x1). So, y - 0 = (-506/1011)(x - 2023). Therefore, the equation is y = (-506/1011)(x - 2023). Now, we need to find the value of c when x =1. So plug x=1 into the equation:y = (-506/1011)(1 - 2023) = (-506/1011)(-2022). Let&#39;s compute that. First, note that 1 - 2023 = -2022. So, multiply that by -506/1011:(-506/1011)*(-2022) = (506 * 2022)/1011.Now, let&#39;s compute 2022 divided by 1011. 1011*2=2022. Therefore, 2022/1011=2. So, this simplifies to 506*2=1012. Therefore, y=1012. Wait, that seems straightforward. So c=1012? Let me verify that again.So, plugging x=1 into the equation:y = (-506/1011)(1 - 2023) = (-506/1011)(-2022) = (506*2022)/1011. Since 2022 is 2*1011, we have 506*2*1011 / 1011. The 1011 cancels out, leaving 506*2=1012. Yes, that works. Alternatively, maybe we could have simplified the slope earlier. Let me see. Since we have m = -506/1011, which is equal to - (506/1011). But since 2022 = 2*1011, so when we compute the term (x -2023) when x=1, that&#39;s 1-2023=-2022, which is -2*1011, so multiplying by the slope:-506/1011 * (-2*1011) = (506*2*1011)/1011 = 506*2 =1012. So same result. Alternatively, maybe using the other point to find the equation. Let&#39;s check. Let&#39;s use point (-2021, 2024). So, using point-slope form: y - 2024 = (-506/1011)(x - (-2021)) =&gt; y - 2024 = (-506/1011)(x +2021). Then, plug in x=1:y - 2024 = (-506/1011)(1 +2021) = (-506/1011)(2022). Again, 2022=2*1011, so that&#39;s (-506/1011)*(2*1011)= -506*2= -1012. Then, y=2024 -1012=1012. Same answer. So that&#39;s consistent.Alternatively, maybe use the parametric equations. Let me see. The line can be parametrized as starting at (2023, 0) and moving towards (-2021, 2024). The vector between the two points is (-2021 -2023, 2024 -0) = (-4044, 2024). So parametric equations: x=2023 -4044t, y=0 +2024t, where t ranges from 0 to1. Now, we need to find t such that x=1. So 1=2023 -4044t. Solving for t:4044t =2023 -1=2022 =&gt; t=2022/4044= 1/2. So t=1/2. Then, y=2024*(1/2)=1012. So again, y=1012. Therefore, c=1012. Wow, three different methods give the same answer, so I think that must be correct. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of linear functions. Let&#39;s suppose the line is y= mx + b. We know two points, so we can find m and b. But I think that&#39;s essentially the same as finding the slope and then the equation. But since all methods are leading to c=1012, I think that&#39;s the answer. Let me just recap:1. Calculated slope between the two points: (2024 -0)/(-2021 -2023)=2024/(-4044)= -506/1011.2. Used point-slope form with (2023,0): y= -506/1011 (x -2023).3. Plugged in x=1: y= -506/1011*(1 -2023)= -506/1011*(-2022)=506*2022/1011=506*2=1012.Same result each time. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a way without computing the slope directly. For example, since the line passes through (2023,0) and (1,c), we can use the idea of similar triangles or the rate of change.But probably overcomplicating. The straightforward method seems solid. So, conclusion: c=1012.Final AnswerThe value of ( c ) is (boxed{1012}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of ( c ) such that the line passing through the points ((2023, 0)) and ((-2021, 2024)) also passes through ((1, c)), we start by calculating the slope of the line. The slope ( m ) between the points ((2023, 0)) and ((-2021, 2024)) is given by:[m = frac{2024 - 0}{-2021 - 2023} = frac{2024}{-4044} = -frac{506}{1011}]Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line with the point ((2023, 0)):[y - 0 = -frac{506}{1011}(x - 2023)]Simplifying, we get:[y = -frac{506}{1011}(x - 2023)]To find ( c ) when ( x = 1 ), we substitute ( x = 1 ) into the equation:[y = -frac{506}{1011}(1 - 2023) = -frac{506}{1011}(-2022)]Simplifying further:[y = frac{506 times 2022}{1011} = frac{506 times 2 times 1011}{1011} = 506 times 2 = 1012]Thus, the value of ( c ) is (boxed{1012}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of c such that the point (1, c) lies on the line passing through the points (2023, 0) and (-2021, 2024). Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that the equation of a line can be found using the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form. Since I have two points, maybe I should start by calculating the slope of the line. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me assign the points: let’s call (2023, 0) as (x1, y1) and (-2021, 2024) as (x2, y2). So plugging into the slope formula, that would be (2024 - 0)/(-2021 - 2023). Calculating the denominator first: -2021 - 2023. Hmm, that&#39;s -2021 -2023. Let me add those: 2021 + 2023 is 4044, so the denominator is -4044. The numerator is 2024 - 0, which is 2024. Therefore, the slope m is 2024 / (-4044). Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are even numbers, so divide numerator and denominator by 4: 2024 ÷ 4 is 506, and 4044 ÷ 4 is 1011. So that gives us -506/1011. Wait, is there a common factor here? Let me check. 506 divided by 2 is 253, which is a prime number (I think), and 1011 divided by 3 is 337. So maybe they don&#39;t have any common factors. Let me confirm: 506 is 2 × 11 × 23? Wait, 11 × 23 is 253, so 506 is 2 × 253. Then 1011 divided by 3 is 337, which is a prime number. So 506 and 1011 share no common factors. Therefore, the simplified slope is -506/1011. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me check again. Original slope was 2024/-4044. Let me see if 2024 and 4044 have a common factor. Let&#39;s check GCD of 2024 and 4044. Divide both numbers by 4: 2024 ÷ 4 = 506, 4044 ÷ 4 = 1011. Then check GCD of 506 and 1011. Using the Euclidean algorithm: GCD(1011, 506). 1011 divided by 506 is 1 with a remainder of 505. Then GCD(506, 505). 506 divided by 505 is 1 with a remainder of 1. Then GCD(505, 1) is 1. So GCD is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is -506/1011. So the slope is -506/1011. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should verify my calculations. Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way to approach this problem without dealing with such large numbers. Let me think. Another way to write the equation of a line passing through two points is using the two-point formula: (y - y1) = [(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)](x - x1). So maybe I can use that. Let&#39;s plug in the values. Let me use (x1, y1) as (2023, 0) and (x2, y2) as (-2021, 2024). So the equation would be (y - 0) = [(2024 - 0)/(-2021 - 2023)](x - 2023). Which simplifies to y = [2024/(-4044)](x - 2023). Which is the same as y = (-2024/4044)(x - 2023). That&#39;s the equation of the line. Now, we need to find c such that the point (1, c) is on this line. So substitute x = 1 into the equation and solve for y (which is c). So c = (-2024/4044)(1 - 2023). Let&#39;s compute 1 - 2023. That&#39;s -2022. So c = (-2024/4044)(-2022). Multiply those two numbers. First, let&#39;s note that both terms are negative, so their product will be positive. Now, 2024 times 2022 divided by 4044. Let me see. Let me try to simplify this fraction. Notice that 4044 is 2 * 2022. So 4044 = 2 * 2022. Therefore, 2022 is 4044 / 2. So substituting into the equation: c = (2024 * 2022) / 4044. But since 4044 is 2 * 2022, we can write this as (2024 * 2022) / (2 * 2022) = 2024 / 2 = 1012. Wait, that seems much simpler. Let me verify that step again. So c = [(-2024)/(-4044)] * (2022). Wait, actually, let me check the arithmetic again. The original equation is c = (-2024/4044)(-2022). Multiplying the two negatives gives a positive. So it&#39;s (2024 * 2022)/4044. Now, 2024 divided by 4044: 4044 is 2*2022. Therefore, 2024 / (2*2022) = (2024 / 2022)/2. But 2024 = 2022 + 2, so 2024/2022 = 1 + 2/2022 = 1 + 1/1011. Therefore, 2024 / 2022 = (2022 + 2)/2022 = 1 + 1/1011. So then, (1 + 1/1011)/2. Hmm, but that might not help. Alternatively, let me see if 2024 and 4044 have common factors. We know that 4044 is 2*2022. 2024 is 2022 + 2. So 2024 = 2022 + 2. Therefore, 2024 = 2*1011 + 2*1 = 2*(1011 + 1) = 2*1012. Wait, that&#39;s not correct. Wait, 2022 is 2*1011, so 2024 is 2022 + 2 = 2*1011 + 2 = 2*(1011 +1) = 2*1012. Oh! So 2024 is 2*1012. Therefore, 2024 = 2*1012. Then 2024 divided by 4044 is (2*1012)/(2*2022) = 1012/2022. Then 1012 and 2022: let&#39;s see if they have a common factor. 2022 divided by 2 is 1011, which is a prime number (I think). 1012 divided by 2 is 506. 506 is 2*253. 253 is 11*23. So 1012 is 2*2*11*23. 2022 is 2*3*337. So GCD of 1012 and 2022 is 2. Therefore, 1012/2022 = (2*506)/(2*1011) = 506/1011. So going back, c = (2024 * 2022)/4044 = (2*1012 * 2022)/(2*2022) = 1012. Wait, that&#39;s a better way. Since 4044 is 2*2022, and the numerator is 2024*2022, then:c = (2024 * 2022) / 4044 = (2024 * 2022) / (2 * 2022) ) = 2024 / 2 = 1012. Oh! Because 2022 cancels out, and 2024 divided by 2 is 1012. That&#39;s much simpler. So the answer is 1012. Wait, so I overcomplicated it initially, but then by breaking down the numbers, I saw that 4044 is 2*2022, which cancels with the 2022 in the numerator. So that simplifies to 2024/2 = 1012. That makes sense. So c = 1012. Let me just verify this with another approach to be sure. Let&#39;s use the parametric equations or another form. Alternatively, the equation of the line can be parametrized. Let’s say we move from point (2023, 0) to (-2021, 2024). The vector between these two points is (-2021 - 2023, 2024 - 0) = (-4044, 2024). So the direction vector is (-4044, 2024). So parametric equations are x = 2023 - 4044*t, y = 0 + 2024*t. We need to find t such that x = 1. So set 2023 - 4044*t = 1. Solving for t: 4044*t = 2023 -1 = 2022. So t = 2022 / 4044 = 2022 / (2*2022) = 1/2. Therefore, t = 1/2. Then substituting into y: y = 2024*(1/2) = 1012. Therefore, c = 1012. Perfect, that confirms it. So regardless of the method, the answer is 1012. Alternatively, using the concept of linear functions. The difference in x between the two points is (-2021 - 2023) = -4044, and the difference in y is 2024 - 0 = 2024. So the slope is 2024 / (-4044) = -506/1011 as before. Then, using point-slope form from (2023, 0):y - 0 = (-506/1011)(x - 2023)So plug in x =1:y = (-506/1011)(1 - 2023) = (-506/1011)(-2022) = (506 * 2022)/1011But 2022 is 2*1011, so:(506 * 2 * 1011)/1011 = 506 * 2 = 1012. So again, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, c = 1012. I think that settles it. The answer is 1012. Final AnswerThe value of ( c ) is boxed{1012}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of ( c ) such that the point ( (1, c) ) lies on the line passing through the points ( (2023, 0) ) and ( (-2021, 2024) ), we start by calculating the slope of the line.

And there are two parts to the problem. The first one is to find the interval where the function is monotonically decreasing. The second part is to find the equation of the tangent line at the point (-2, f(-2)). Let me tackle each part one by one.Starting with the first part: finding where the function is monotonically decreasing. I remember that to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing, we need to look at its first derivative. If the first derivative is positive on an interval, the function is increasing there, and if it&#39;s negative, the function is decreasing. So, I need to compute f&#39;(x) first.Let me compute the derivative. The derivative of -x³ is -3x², right? Then the derivative of 3x² is 6x. The derivative of 9x is 9, and the derivative of the constant 1 is 0. So putting it all together, f&#39;(x) = -3x² + 6x + 9. Now, to find where the function is decreasing, I need to find where f&#39;(x) &lt; 0. So, let&#39;s solve the inequality -3x² + 6x + 9 &lt; 0. Hmm, quadratic inequalities can be tricky, but let me recall the steps. First, maybe I can factor the quadratic or find its roots to determine the intervals where it&#39;s positive or negative.Let me start by simplifying the inequality. Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of x² positive. However, I have to remember that multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So:-3x² + 6x + 9 &lt; 0  Multiplying both sides by -1:  3x² - 6x - 9 &gt; 0Now, the inequality is 3x² -6x -9 &gt; 0. Let&#39;s factor this quadratic if possible. First, factor out a 3:3(x² - 2x - 3) &gt; 0Now, factor the quadratic inside the parentheses. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1. So:x² - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1)Therefore, the inequality becomes:3(x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0Since 3 is a positive constant, we can divide both sides by 3 without changing the inequality:(x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0Now, we need to solve (x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0. To do this, we can find the critical points where the expression equals zero, which are x = 3 and x = -1. These points divide the number line into three intervals:1. x &lt; -12. -1 &lt; x &lt; 33. x &gt; 3We need to test each interval to see the sign of the product (x - 3)(x + 1).For interval 1 (x &lt; -1): Let&#39;s pick x = -2. Then (-2 - 3) = -5 and (-2 + 1) = -1. The product is (-5)(-1) = 5, which is positive.For interval 2 (-1 &lt; x &lt; 3): Let&#39;s pick x = 0. Then (0 - 3) = -3 and (0 + 1) = 1. The product is (-3)(1) = -3, which is negative.For interval 3 (x &gt; 3): Let&#39;s pick x = 4. Then (4 - 3) = 1 and (4 + 1) = 5. The product is (1)(5) = 5, which is positive.So the inequality (x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0 is satisfied in intervals x &lt; -1 and x &gt; 3. Therefore, going back to the original inequality after multiplying by -1, which was 3(x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0. But wait, this was equivalent to the original derivative being less than 0. So f&#39;(x) &lt; 0 when x is in (-∞, -1) or (3, ∞). But wait, no, hold on. Let me check.Wait, original inequality was -3x² +6x +9 &lt;0. Then after multiplying by -1, we had 3x² -6x -9 &gt;0. Then we factored and found that (x -3)(x +1) &gt;0, which is true for x &lt; -1 or x &gt;3. Therefore, the original derivative f&#39;(x) is negative (since we reversed the inequality) when x is in (-∞, -1) or (3, ∞). Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on those intervals.But wait, that doesn&#39;t seem right. Let me confirm. If the derivative is negative in (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞), then the function is decreasing there, and increasing in between (-1, 3). Let me check with a test point. For example, take x = 0, which is in (-1,3). Then f&#39;(0) = -3(0)^2 +6(0) +9 = 9, which is positive, so the function is increasing there. Then, take x = -2: f&#39;(-2) = -3(4) +6(-2) +9 = -12 -12 +9 = -15, which is negative. So decreasing at x=-2. Similarly, x=4: f&#39;(4) = -3(16) +6(4) +9 = -48 +24 +9 = -15, which is negative. So yes, decreasing at x=4. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the function is monotonically decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). But the problem asks for the interval where it&#39;s decreasing. Wait, maybe they want both intervals? But sometimes, depending on the function, there might be a single interval, but in this case, it&#39;s two intervals. Let me check if I made a mistake in the derivative.Wait, the original function is a cubic, so the derivative is a quadratic. The quadratic opens downward because the coefficient is -3. Wait, no, the original derivative is f&#39;(x) = -3x² +6x +9, which is a quadratic with a negative coefficient on x², so it opens downward. So the graph of the derivative is a downward-opening parabola. Therefore, it has a maximum at its vertex. The roots of the derivative (where f&#39;(x)=0) are at x = -1 and x = 3. So the derivative is positive between -1 and 3, and negative outside. Therefore, the original function f(x) is increasing on (-1, 3) and decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). Therefore, the answer for part 1 is (-∞, -1) ∪ (3, ∞). But let me check the problem statement again: it says &quot;the interval&quot; but it might have two intervals. So we need to write both.But let me check if the problem uses interval notation. Yes, so the answer is two intervals. So part 1&#39;s answer is (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). But since they are separate, we can write them in interval notation as (-∞, -1) ∪ (3, ∞). Okay, that&#39;s part 1.Now moving on to part 2: finding the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at the point (-2, f(-2)). To find the equation of a tangent line, I need two things: the slope of the tangent at that point and a point through which the tangent passes. They already gave the point (-2, f(-2)), so I need to compute f(-2) to get the exact coordinates, and then compute the derivative at x = -2 to get the slope.First, let&#39;s compute f(-2). The function is f(x) = -x³ +3x² +9x +1. Plugging in x = -2:f(-2) = -(-2)^3 + 3(-2)^2 +9(-2) +1  First, compute each term:  -(-2)^3 = -(-8) = 8  3(-2)^2 = 3(4) =12  9(-2) = -18  1 is just 1  Adding them up: 8 +12 -18 +1 = (8 +12) + (-18 +1) = 20 -17 = 3So f(-2) = 3. Therefore, the point is (-2, 3).Next, compute the derivative at x = -2 to get the slope. We already found the derivative earlier: f&#39;(x) = -3x² +6x +9. Plugging in x = -2:f&#39;(-2) = -3(-2)^2 +6(-2) +9  Calculate each term:  -3(-2)^2 = -3(4) = -12  6(-2) = -12  9 is 9  Adding them up: -12 -12 +9 = (-24) +9 = -15So the slope of the tangent line at x = -2 is -15.Now, using the point-slope form of the equation of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point and m is the slope.Plugging in x1 = -2, y1 = 3, and m = -15:y - 3 = -15(x - (-2))  Simplify:  y - 3 = -15(x + 2)Now, let&#39;s convert this into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) if needed. Distribute the -15:y - 3 = -15x -30  Add 3 to both sides:  y = -15x -30 +3  y = -15x -27So the equation of the tangent line is y = -15x -27.Let me double-check the calculations to be sure. For f(-2):-(-2)^3 is -(-8) which is +8. Correct. 3*(-2)^2 is 3*4=12. Correct. 9*(-2)=-18. Correct. 8 +12 is 20, 20 -18 is 2, 2 +1 is 3. Yes, f(-2)=3.For f&#39;(-2):-3*(-2)^2 is -3*4=-12. Correct. 6*(-2)=-12. Correct. So -12 -12 +9 is indeed -15. Correct.Then the equation: y -3 = -15(x +2). Expanding that gives y = -15x -30 +3 = -15x -27. Correct.So part 2&#39;s answer is y = -15x -27.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the equation of the tangent line&quot;. They might accept either form, but usually, slope-intercept is preferred unless specified otherwise. So y = -15x -27 is fine.Therefore, summarizing both parts:1. The function is monotonically decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞).  2. The tangent line at (-2, 3) has the equation y = -15x -27.I think that&#39;s it. Let me quickly recap to make sure I didn&#39;t skip any steps.For part 1, computed derivative, found where it was negative by solving the inequality, correctly handled multiplying by -1 and reversing the inequality, tested intervals, confirmed with test points. All looks good.For part 2, computed f(-2) correctly, derivative at -2 correctly, used point-slope form and converted to slope-intercept. All steps seem solid.So yeah, that&#39;s the solution.Final Answer1. The interval where f(x) is monotonically decreasing is boxed{(-infty, -1) cup (3, infty)}.2. The equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = -15x - 27}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine where the function ( f(x) = -x^3 + 3x^2 + 9x + 1 ) is monotonically decreasing, we first find its derivative:[ f&#39;(x) = -3x^2 + 6x + 9 ]We need to solve the inequality ( f&#39;(x) &lt; 0 ):[-3x^2 + 6x + 9 &lt; 0]Multiplying by -1 and reversing the inequality:[3x^2 - 6x - 9 &gt; 0]Factoring the quadratic expression:[3(x^2 - 2x - 3) &gt; 0 implies 3(x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0]Solving the inequality ( (x - 3)(x + 1) &gt; 0 ) gives the intervals ( x &lt; -1 ) and ( x &gt; 3 ). Therefore, the function is monotonically decreasing on:[(-infty, -1) cup (3, infty)]For the tangent line at the point ((-2, f(-2))):First, compute ( f(-2) ):[f(-2) = -(-2)^3 + 3(-2)^2 + 9(-2) + 1 = 8 + 12 - 18 + 1 = 3]The point is ((-2, 3)). Next, find the derivative at ( x = -2 ):[f&#39;(-2) = -3(-2)^2 + 6(-2) + 9 = -12 - 12 + 9 = -15]Using the point-slope form of the tangent line equation:[y - 3 = -15(x + 2)]Converting to slope-intercept form:[y = -15x - 27] Final Answer1. The interval where ( f(x) ) is monotonically decreasing is (boxed{(-infty, -1) cup (3, infty)}).2. The equation of the tangent line is (boxed{y = -15x - 27}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, we have the function f(x) = -x³ + 3x² + 9x + 1. There are two parts: first, finding the interval where the function is monotonically decreasing, and second, finding the equation of the tangent line at the point (-2, f(-2)). Let&#39;s start with the first part.For the first part, I remember that to find where a function is increasing or decreasing, we need to look at its first derivative. If the first derivative is positive on an interval, the function is increasing there; if it&#39;s negative, the function is decreasing. So, first things first, let&#39;s find f&#39;(x).Differentiating f(x):f(x) = -x³ + 3x² + 9x + 1The derivative term by term:- The derivative of -x³ is -3x².- The derivative of 3x² is 6x.- The derivative of 9x is 9.- The derivative of the constant term 1 is 0.So putting it all together:f&#39;(x) = -3x² + 6x + 9Alright, so now we have f&#39;(x) = -3x² + 6x + 9. To find where the function is decreasing, we need to find where f&#39;(x) &lt; 0.Let&#39;s solve the inequality -3x² + 6x + 9 &lt; 0.First, maybe factor the quadratic if possible. Let me factor out a -3 first to make it simpler:-3(x² - 2x - 3) &lt; 0So, the inequality becomes:-3(x² - 2x - 3) &lt; 0Dividing both sides by -3 (but remember, dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign):x² - 2x - 3 &gt; 0Now, factor the quadratic inside the parentheses:x² - 2x - 3Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, factors of -3 are 1 and -3. So, 1 and -3 multiply to -3 and add to -2. So, yes:x² - 2x - 3 = (x + 1)(x - 3)So, the inequality becomes:(x + 1)(x - 3) &gt; 0Now, to solve (x + 1)(x - 3) &gt; 0, we need to find the intervals where this product is positive. The critical points are x = -1 and x = 3, which divide the real line into three intervals:1. x &lt; -12. -1 &lt; x &lt; 33. x &gt; 3Now, let&#39;s test each interval.1. For x &lt; -1: Let&#39;s pick x = -2. Plugging into (x + 1)(x - 3): (-2 +1)(-2 -3) = (-1)(-5) = 5 &gt; 0. So positive here.2. For -1 &lt; x &lt; 3: Let&#39;s pick x = 0. (0 +1)(0 -3) = (1)(-3) = -3 &lt; 0. Negative here.3. For x &gt; 3: Let&#39;s pick x = 4. (4 +1)(4 -3) = (5)(1) = 5 &gt; 0. Positive here.So, the inequality (x + 1)(x - 3) &gt; 0 holds when x &lt; -1 or x &gt; 3. But remember that our original inequality after dividing by -3 was x² - 2x - 3 &gt; 0, which corresponds to f&#39;(x) &lt; 0.Therefore, f&#39;(x) &lt; 0 when x &lt; -1 or x &gt; 3. But wait, this is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient (after factoring out the -3, we had x² - 2x - 3, which is a parabola opening upwards). The inequality x² - 2x - 3 &gt; 0 is satisfied outside the roots, so as we found, x &lt; -1 or x &gt; 3. Therefore, f&#39;(x) &lt; 0 on those intervals, which means the function f(x) is decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞).Wait a second, but the original problem asks for the interval where f(x) is monotonically decreasing. So, since f&#39;(x) &lt; 0 on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞), those are the intervals where the function is decreasing. But we need to write the answer as intervals. Depending on the problem&#39;s context, sometimes they might want the union of these intervals, but usually, for monotonically decreasing, it&#39;s either one interval or multiple. In this case, it&#39;s two separate intervals. Let me check the derivative again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify. Let&#39;s confirm with test points.Original derivative: f&#39;(x) = -3x² + 6x + 9.Let me plug in x = -2 (which is in the interval x &lt; -1):f&#39;(-2) = -3*(-2)^2 + 6*(-2) + 9 = -3*4 + (-12) + 9 = -12 -12 +9 = -15. Which is negative, so f is decreasing there.Now, x = 0 (which is in -1 &lt; x &lt;3):f&#39;(0) = -3*(0)^2 +6*0 +9 = 9. Positive. So increasing here.x = 4 (in x &gt;3):f&#39;(4) = -3*(16) +6*4 +9 = -48 +24 +9 = -15. Negative, so decreasing here.Therefore, the function is decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). So, the answer is the union of these two intervals. But let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;the interval where f(x) is monotonically decreasing&quot;. However, if there are two separate intervals, we need to mention both. But maybe the problem expects a single interval? Wait, the original function is a cubic, so its derivative is a quadratic, which can have two intervals where it&#39;s negative. So, it&#39;s correct that the function decreases on two intervals. So, the answer for part 1 is (-∞, -1) ∪ (3, ∞).Hmm. Let me check again. Maybe not. Wait, another way: the critical points are x = -1 and x =3. The derivative is a quadratic opening downward because the coefficient of x² in f&#39;(x) is -3. Wait, actually, wait: f&#39;(x) is -3x² +6x +9, which is a quadratic with a = -3, which opens downward. So the graph of f&#39;(x) is a downward opening parabola. So, the parabola has a maximum at its vertex, and it crosses the x-axis at x = -1 and x =3. Therefore, the derivative is positive between -1 and 3, and negative outside. Wait, but hold on, if the parabola opens downward, then between the roots, the quadratic is positive, and negative outside. So f&#39;(x) &gt;0 in (-1, 3) and f&#39;(x) &lt;0 in (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). So yes, that&#39;s consistent with our previous conclusion. Therefore, the function is increasing on (-1, 3) and decreasing elsewhere. Therefore, the answer for part 1 is the intervals where it&#39;s decreasing: (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). So, writing as two intervals separated by union.Now, moving to part 2: Find the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at the point (-2, f(-2)).To find the equation of the tangent line at a point, we need two things: the slope of the tangent line at that point, which is f&#39;(-2), and the coordinates of the point, which are given as (-2, f(-2)). Then we can use the point-slope form to write the equation.First, let&#39;s compute f(-2). Let&#39;s plug x = -2 into f(x):f(-2) = -(-2)^3 + 3*(-2)^2 +9*(-2) +1Calculating term by term:- (-2)^3 = -(-8) = 8- 3*(-2)^2 = 3*4 = 12- 9*(-2) = -18- 1 remains 1So, adding them up:8 + 12 -18 +1 = (8+12) + (-18 +1) = 20 -17 = 3Therefore, f(-2) = 3. So the point is (-2, 3).Next, compute the derivative at x = -2, which is f&#39;(-2). We already found f&#39;(x) = -3x² +6x +9.So f&#39;(-2) = -3*(-2)^2 +6*(-2) +9 = -3*4 + (-12) +9 = -12 -12 +9 = -15. Wait, earlier when we tested x = -2, we found f&#39;(-2) = -15. So the slope of the tangent line is -15.Now, using the point-slope form. The general formula is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point and m is the slope.So here, x1 = -2, y1 = 3, m = -15.Plugging into the formula:y - 3 = -15(x - (-2)) =&gt; y - 3 = -15(x + 2)Expanding this:y = -15(x + 2) + 3Let&#39;s distribute the -15:y = -15x -30 +3 =&gt; y = -15x -27Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = -15x -27.Let me double-check these calculations.First, f(-2):- (-2)^3 is -8, but with a negative sign in front: -(-8) = 8. Correct.3*(-2)^2: (-2)^2 is 4, 3*4=12. Correct.9*(-2)= -18. Correct.So 8 +12 -18 +1: 8+12=20; -18+1=-17; 20-17=3. Correct.Then f&#39;(-2):-3*(-2)^2: (-2)^2=4, times -3: -126*(-2)= -12Sum: -12 -12 +9 = (-24) +9 = -15. Correct.So slope is -15. Point is (-2,3). So equation:y -3 = -15(x +2). Expanding:y = -15x -30 +3 =&gt; y = -15x -27. Correct.Alternatively, maybe write it as y = -15x -27. That seems right.So, to recap:1. The function is decreasing on (-∞, -1) and (3, ∞). So, in interval notation, we can write (-∞, -1) ∪ (3, ∞).2. The tangent line at (-2, 3) has equation y = -15x -27.Wait, just to make sure, is there any possibility that part 1 is expecting a single interval? But since the derivative is a quadratic, and since it&#39;s negative on two intervals, it&#39;s decreasing on two intervals. So the answer should be both intervals. So unless there&#39;s a mistake in my calculation, which I don&#39;t see.Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting an interval where it&#39;s decreasing only in a certain region. Wait, let me check the derivative again.Wait, if the derivative is negative left of x=-1 and right of x=3, then the function is decreasing on those intervals, so the answer is two intervals. Therefore, the answer for part 1 is (-∞, -1) union (3, ∞). So that&#39;s correct.Okay, seems like both parts are sorted.Final Answer1. The interval where ( f(x) ) is monotonically decreasing is (boxed{(-infty, -1) cup (3, infty)}).2.

So, we have a circus arena with n different spotlights. Each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. The conditions are:1. If any one spotlight is turned off, the arena is still fully illuminated.2. If any two spotlights are turned off, the arena is no longer fully illuminated.We need to figure out for which values of n this is possible. Hmm.First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand. Each spotlight covers a convex region. The union of all these regions is the entire arena. But if you remove any one spotlight, the remaining ones still cover the arena. However, if you remove any two, there&#39;s some part of the arena that&#39;s not covered. So each spotlight is redundant in the sense that it&#39;s not necessary on its own, but any two are necessary. That seems similar to some concepts in set theory or linear algebra where elements are redundant but necessary in pairs. Maybe like a basis or something?But here, we&#39;re dealing with convex sets. The key is that each spotlight&#39;s coverage is a convex set, and their union is the entire arena. The conditions are about coverage when subsets are removed.Let me think about the properties of convex sets. The union of convex sets isn&#39;t necessarily convex, but here the arena itself is a convex shape? Wait, the problem says the arena is illuminated by the spotlights, but it doesn&#39;t specify the arena&#39;s shape. But each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. Hmm. The arena could be any shape, but the union of the spotlights&#39; convex regions must cover the arena. Wait, maybe the arena is a convex polygon? Because if the arena is a regular polygon, but the problem says &quot;Regular Polygons&quot; under the tags. Maybe that&#39;s a hint?Wait, the problem is categorized under &quot;Pairings and Groups; Bijections,&quot; &quot;Regular Polygons,&quot; &quot;Examples and Counterexamples. Constructions.&quot; So perhaps the answer relates to regular polygons and their properties? Maybe the spotlights correspond to sides or vertices of a regular polygon?But let&#39;s think more generally first. The problem is about coverage redundancy. If each spotlight is redundant (i.e., removing any one still leaves full coverage), but any two spotlights are not redundant (i.e., removing any two leaves some area uncovered). So the system is 1-redundant but not 2-redundant. In covering problems, this is similar to saying the covering number is n, and the redundancy is 1. But the exact conditions here are a bit specific.In terms of convex sets, Helly&#39;s theorem comes to mind. Helly&#39;s theorem states that for a finite number of convex sets in R^d, if the intersection of every d+1 of them is non-empty, then the whole collection has a non-empty intersection. But we&#39;re dealing with a covering problem rather than an intersection problem. However, maybe there&#39;s a dual concept here.Alternatively, maybe think about the spotlights as covering the arena such that every point in the arena is covered by at least two spotlights. Because if you remove one, the remaining still cover everything, so each point must be covered by at least two spotlights. But if you remove two, then some point is only covered by those two, so there exists a point that&#39;s only covered by those two. Wait, that might not hold. Let me think again.If removing any single spotlight still leaves the arena covered, then every point in the arena must be covered by at least two spotlights. Because if there was a point covered by only one spotlight, then turning off that spotlight would leave that point uncovered, contradicting the first condition. Therefore, every point is covered by at least two spotlights. Then, if you remove two spotlights, there must be some point that was only covered by those two. Because otherwise, even after removing two spotlights, all points would still be covered by at least one remaining spotlight. Therefore, for every pair of spotlights, there exists a point that is only covered by those two. Therefore, each pair of spotlights has a unique region that is only covered by them. Hmm.So, translating the problem into set terms: the family of convex sets (spotlights) covers the arena (the union is the entire arena). Moreover, the intersection of the complements of any two spotlights is non-empty (since removing those two leaves some part uncovered), but the intersection of the complement of any single spotlight is empty (since removing one still leaves everything covered). So, in terms of complements, the complement of each spotlight is a region not covered by that spotlight, but the intersection of any two complements is non-empty. Wait, but the entire arena is covered by all spotlights, so the intersection of all complements is empty. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.Alternatively, think of each spotlight as a set S_i. The union of all S_i is the arena. For any S_i, the union of S_j for j ≠ i is still the arena. So S_i is contained in the union of the others. But for any two S_i and S_j, there exists a point not in the union of the others, so S_i ∪ S_j does not cover the arena. Wait, no: if you remove two spotlights, the remaining don&#39;t cover the arena. So the union of all S_k where k ≠ i,j is not the arena. Therefore, there exists a point that is not in any S_k for k ≠ i,j, meaning that point is only in S_i and S_j. So for any pair i,j, there exists a point p_{i,j} that is only covered by S_i and S_j. Therefore, each pair of spotlights uniquely covers some point. But each point is covered by at least two spotlights.So, in combinatorics terms, this is similar to a covering design where each pair of sets covers a unique point. But in our case, each pair must cover at least one unique point not covered by any other set. Wait, but not necessarily unique, just that for each pair, there&#39;s a point covered only by them. So each pair has a unique &quot;witness&quot; point that is only covered by them. Therefore, the number of such witness points would be at least the number of pairs of spotlights, which is C(n,2). But each spotlight is a convex set. So each pair&#39;s witness point must lie in the intersection of S_i and S_j but not in any other S_k.So, if we have n convex sets in the plane (assuming the arena is a planar convex set, maybe a regular polygon), such that each pair&#39;s intersection contains a point not in any other set, and each point is in at least two sets. Wait, but how does this relate to the values of n?But in the plane, convex sets have the property that the intersection of two convex sets is convex. Also, if you have multiple convex sets, their intersections can be complicated. But if each pair has a unique witness point, then those points must be distinct for each pair. However, in the plane, arranging convex sets such that each pair has a unique point not shared with any other set might be possible only for certain n.Wait, maybe think about the dual problem. If each pair of spotlights has a unique point that only they cover, then those points must be arranged such that each point is in exactly two convex sets. So it&#39;s like an incidence structure where points are covered by exactly two sets, and each pair of sets covers exactly one point. That&#39;s similar to a projective plane or a block design, specifically a (v, k, λ) design where v is the number of points, b is the number of sets (spotlights), each point is in r sets, each set contains k points, and each pair of sets intersects in λ points. But here, we have each pair of sets (spotlights) intersecting in exactly one point (the witness point), and each point is in exactly two sets. That&#39;s a symmetric (v, k, λ) design with λ = 1 and k = 2. Wait, no, in our case, the sets are the spotlights, which are convex sets (so they can contain infinitely many points), but each pair of sets has a unique witness point. However, in design theory, a projective plane of order q has parameters (v, k, λ) = (q^2 + q + 1, q + 1, 1), with each pair of lines intersecting in one point, and each point lying on q + 1 lines. But here, each point lies on exactly two lines (spotlights), and each pair of lines (spotlights) intersect in one point. That would be a different design.Wait, if each pair of spotlights intersects in exactly one point, and each point is on exactly two spotlights, then the number of points would be C(n, 2), since each pair defines a point, and each point is defined by one pair. The number of incidences would be 2 * C(n, 2) = n(n - 1). But in design terms, each point is in two spotlights, so the total number of incidences is also 2v, where v is the number of points. Thus, v = C(n, 2). However, in such a design, each spotlight must cover exactly n - 1 points (since each spotlight is paired with n - 1 others, each contributing one point). But in our problem, the spotlights are convex sets in the plane (assuming the arena is planar). So each convex set (spotlight) must cover (n - 1) distinct points, each shared with another spotlight. However, convex sets in the plane can&#39;t have too many points in convex position unless n is small.Wait, if each spotlight is a convex set containing n - 1 points, each of which is shared with another spotlight, then the arrangement of these points must be such that each pair of spotlights shares exactly one point. But in the plane, if you have a convex set, all the points it contains must lie within its convex hull. So, for each spotlight, the n - 1 points it shares with others must lie inside its convex shape. But if those points are also part of other convex sets, their positions are constrained.Alternatively, maybe think of the spotlights as sides of a regular polygon. For example, in a regular n-gon, each side is a line segment. But the entire polygon is covered by its sides? No, the sides are just the edges; the interior is the actual polygon. Wait, maybe not sides, but something else. Wait, if the arena is a regular polygon, maybe the spotlights are arranged such that each spotlight covers a certain region.Wait, maybe consider the spotlights as the sides of the polygon. If each spotlight is a side, then turning off a side would leave the polygon still illuminated because the other sides cover the edges. But the problem states that the spotlights illuminate convex shapes. If the arena is the polygon itself, then each spotlight needs to cover a convex region. If the spotlights are the sides, but sides are line segments, which are convex, but their union is just the boundary, not the entire polygon. So that doesn&#39;t work. Maybe the spotlights are the angles or something else.Alternatively, think of each spotlight as a triangle covering one vertex and the center. Wait, if you have a regular polygon, maybe each spotlight is a sector corresponding to a vertex. For example, in a regular n-gon, each spotlight could be a sector from the center to each vertex, forming a triangle. Then, each sector is convex. If you remove one sector, the remaining sectors still cover the entire polygon because the missing sector&#39;s area is covered by adjacent sectors. Wait, but in a regular polygon, the sectors (if they are like slices) would each cover a 360/n degree angle. If you remove one sector, the remaining would cover 360 - 360/n degrees. But that leaves a gap. Wait, no, if the sectors are overlapping. Maybe if the sectors are wider.Alternatively, each spotlight could be a convex region covering all but one edge of the polygon. Then, if you remove one spotlight, the remaining spotlights still cover the entire polygon. But if you remove two, then two edges are missing. Wait, but edges are just lines; the arena is the polygon&#39;s interior. Hmm.Alternatively, each spotlight is a convex region that covers the entire polygon except for a small segment near each vertex. But if you remove one spotlight, the others cover the entire polygon. Wait, maybe not.Wait, let&#39;s take a simple case. Let&#39;s start with small n and see if it&#39;s possible.Case n = 2: Two spotlights. If you turn off one, the other must still cover the arena. But if you turn off both, obviously it&#39;s not covered. But the problem states that if any two are turned off, it&#39;s not covered. But with n=2, turning off two spotlights would mean turning off both, which is not covered. But the first condition is that turning off any one still leaves it covered. So each spotlight alone must cover the arena. But the problem says that each spotlight is a convex shape whose union with the others covers the arena. If n=2, both spotlights individually cover the arena. Then their union is obviously the arena. But if you turn off one, the other still covers it, and if you turn off both, it&#39;s dark. But the problem states &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;, which would be satisfied here. But &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; For n=2, that&#39;s also satisfied. But does this meet the problem&#39;s initial condition? Wait, the problem says &quot;Each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape.&quot; So if each spotlight alone can illuminate the entire arena, then their union is redundant. But the problem says &quot;It is known that if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;, which is satisfied here. But the problem is asking for which n this is possible, so n=2 is possible. Wait, but the problem says &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; For n=2, turning off both spotlights (which are the only two) would result in no light, so that&#39;s okay. So n=2 is possible. But maybe the answer is all n ≥ 2? But that seems unlikely. Wait, let&#39;s check n=3.Case n=3: Three spotlights. Each one individually can be turned off, and the remaining two cover the arena. But if you turn off any two, the remaining one does not. So each pair of spotlights must cover the arena, but any single one does not. Wait, no: the problem states that if you turn off one, the remaining cover the arena. So each spotlight is redundant. But if you turn off two, the remaining one does not cover the arena. Therefore, each single spotlight is not sufficient, but any two are sufficient. Wait, that&#39;s different from the initial problem. Wait, the problem says: &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; So with n=3, if you turn off one, the remaining two still cover the arena. If you turn off two, the remaining one does not. Therefore, each spotlight is redundant (since removing it leaves two which cover the arena), but two spotlights are necessary. So for n=3, is this possible? Let&#39;s see.Suppose the arena is a triangle. Let each spotlight be a convex region covering two edges of the triangle. For example, each spotlight covers one side and the opposite vertex. Wait, if you have three spotlights:- Spotlight 1 covers side BC and vertex A.- Spotlight 2 covers side AC and vertex B.- Spotlight 3 covers side AB and vertex C.Each spotlight is a convex set (a line segment from the vertex to the opposite side, plus the side). Wait, but the union of all three would be the entire triangle. If you turn off spotlight 1, then spotlights 2 and 3 cover sides AC, AB, and vertices B and C. But does that cover the entire triangle? Vertex A is only covered by spotlight 1, so if we turn off spotlight 1, vertex A is not covered. Therefore, that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe each spotlight is a region near each vertex. For example, each spotlight is a small circle around each vertex. The union of the three circles covers the triangle. If you remove one circle, the other two still cover the triangle? Probably not, since the third vertex&#39;s circle is removed, leaving that vertex uncovered. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, think of the spotlights as three rectangles covering different parts of the triangle. But it&#39;s tricky to ensure that any two cover the entire arena. Maybe an easier approach is to use Helly&#39;s theorem. Helly&#39;s theorem says that for convex sets in R^d, if the intersection of every d+1 sets is non-empty, then the whole intersection is non-empty. But here we have a covering problem. Maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, consider that the intersection of the complements. If the arena is not covered when two spotlights are off, that means the intersection of the complements of two spotlights is non-empty. But if one spotlight is off, the complement of that spotlight is empty (since the union of the rest covers the arena). So for each spotlight, the complement is empty when considering the union of others. But the intersection of two complements is non-empty. So in terms of set theory, for each i, the complement of S_i is contained in the union of the complements of the other S_j. Wait, no, that might not hold.Wait, if removing any one spotlight leaves the arena covered, that means that the complement of S_i is covered by the union of the other S_j. So, the complement of S_i is a subset of the union of the other S_j&#39;s complements. Because if a point is not in S_i, it must be in some other S_j. Therefore, the complement of S_i is equal to the union of the complements of S_j intersected with the complement of S_i. Hmm, getting confused here.Alternatively, using set theory notation:Let U be the arena, and S_1, ..., S_n be the convex sets covering U. The conditions are:1. For every i, U = union_{j ≠ i} S_j. So, every point in U is in at least one S_j for j ≠ i.2. For every pair i, j, U ≠ union_{k ≠ i,j} S_k. So, there exists a point in U not in any S_k for k ≠ i,j, meaning that point is only in S_i and S_j.Therefore, each pair S_i, S_j has a unique witness point p_{i,j} that is only in S_i and S_j.Therefore, each S_i must contain all p_{i,j} for j ≠ i. Because p_{i,j} is in S_i and S_j. So, for each S_i, it contains n - 1 points p_{i,j} (for each j ≠ i). Additionally, S_i must be convex. So all the points p_{i,j} must lie within S_i.But in the plane, a convex set containing multiple points must contain their convex hull. Therefore, the convex hull of all p_{i,j} for j ≠ i must lie within S_i. But if the points p_{i,j} are arranged such that their convex hull is the entire arena, then S_i must be the entire arena, which contradicts the requirement that S_i is a convex set whose union with others is the arena but not individually.Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me think again.Suppose each S_i is a convex set that contains all the points p_{i,j} for j ≠ i. If these points are arranged such that their convex hull is the entire arena, then S_i would have to be the entire arena, which can&#39;t be because then turning off S_i would not affect the coverage. But the problem states that turning off two spotlights leaves the arena not fully covered, which requires that each S_i is not the entire arena. Therefore, the points p_{i,j} must not form a convex hull covering the entire arena. But how?Alternatively, maybe arrange the points p_{i,j} on the boundary of the arena. For example, if the arena is a convex polygon, and each p_{i,j} is a vertex of the polygon. Then each S_i is a convex set containing all but one vertex. Wait, if the arena is a polygon with n vertices, and each spotlight S_i is the convex hull of all vertices except the i-th one. Then the union of all S_i would be the entire polygon because each vertex is included in all S_i except one. If you remove one S_i, the remaining S_j still include all vertices except the i-th one, but the convex hulls might not cover the entire polygon. Wait, no. For example, in a triangle, each S_i would be an edge opposite the i-th vertex. Then the union of the three edges is just the boundary, not the entire triangle. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if each S_i is a triangle missing one vertex. But again, their union might not cover the entire polygon.Wait, perhaps consider the problem in dual terms. If each S_i must contain all p_{i,j} for j ≠ i, and each p_{i,j} is a point only in S_i and S_j. Then, for n=3, each S_i must contain two points: p_{i,j} and p_{i,k}. These points must also be in S_j and S_k respectively. If we arrange three points in a triangle, each S_i could be the edge opposite to the point p_{i,j}. But again, the union would just be the edges.Wait, maybe think in terms of the Radon&#39;s theorem or other convex geometry theorems. Radon&#39;s theorem states that any set of d+2 points in R^d can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls intersect. But not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, think about the maximum number of convex sets that can satisfy the given conditions. For the problem to hold, each pair of convex sets must have a unique witness point. In the plane, if you have n convex sets, the number of such witness points is C(n, 2). Each witness point lies in exactly two convex sets. Additionally, each convex set must contain n - 1 witness points. Now, in the plane, if you have a convex set containing m points, the convex hull of those points must be within the convex set. Therefore, for each S_i, the convex hull of its n - 1 witness points must lie within S_i. If all the witness points are in convex position, then each S_i must contain the convex hull of n - 1 points. But if the entire arena is the convex hull of all C(n, 2) witness points, then each S_i only contains a subset of these points, but their union must cover the entire arena. This seems challenging.Alternatively, consider that the entire arena is a convex polygon, and the witness points are placed at the vertices. For example, if the arena is a regular n-gon, and each pair of spotlights corresponds to a vertex. Wait, but n spotlights would correspond to n vertices, but we need C(n, 2) witness points. That doesn&#39;t align.Wait, perhaps the minimal case where the arena is a triangle. Let&#39;s try n=3. If the arena is a triangle, and we need three convex sets (spotlights) such that each pair has a unique witness point (a vertex?), but each spotlight must cover two vertices. Wait, if each spotlight is a side of the triangle, then the union of the sides is just the perimeter, not the entire triangle. If each spotlight is a region covering two vertices and the edge between them, then the union of three such regions would cover the entire triangle. For example, each spotlight is a trapezoid covering one edge and extending inward. Then, turning off one spotlight, the other two trapezoids still cover the entire triangle? Maybe not, because the central area might only be covered by all three. Hmm.Alternatively, use the concept of the Venn diagram. For three sets, a Venn diagram has regions representing all possible intersections. But with convex sets, it&#39;s difficult to have three convex sets with all possible intersections. However, in our case, we need that every pair of sets has a unique region (point) that is only their intersection, not covered by the third set. So, three convex sets where each pair overlaps in a unique region not covered by the third. Is this possible?Suppose we have three convex sets in the plane such that each pair intersects in a distinct region, and those regions are not covered by the third set. For example, three convex polygons arranged such that each pair overlaps in a specific area. If those overlapping areas are points, then each pair intersects at a unique point, and those points are not in the third set. Then, the union of all three sets would cover everything except those three points. Wait, no, if each pair&#39;s intersection is a point not in the third set, then those three points would each be in two sets. So, the union would include all three points. But if you remove two sets, the third set doesn&#39;t cover the intersection points of the other two. Wait, let me think.Suppose we have three convex sets S1, S2, S3. Each pair S1∩S2, S1∩S3, S2∩S3 contains a unique point not in the third set. So:- p12 is in S1 and S2, but not in S3.- p13 is in S1 and S3, but not in S2.- p23 is in S2 and S3, but not in S1.Then, the union S1∪S2∪S3 includes all three points p12, p13, p23. If we remove S3, then S1∪S2 still covers p12 and p13 (wait, p13 is in S1 and S3, but S3 is removed, so p13 is only in S1). But if p13 is only in S1, then removing S3 doesn&#39;t affect p13&#39;s coverage. Wait, no, if p13 is in S1 and S3, but not in S2. So if you remove S3, p13 is still covered by S1. Similarly, p12 is covered by S1 and S2. So actually, in this case, removing any one set still leaves all points covered. Wait, but according to the problem&#39;s first condition, the entire arena must still be covered. So maybe the rest of the arena is covered by all three sets. But the problem states that when you remove two sets, some part is uncovered. The parts that would be uncovered are the points p12, p13, p23, but those are single points. However, the problem says the arena is no longer fully illuminated, which could include points or regions. But in reality, the problem states that each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. If those convex shapes are such that their union is the entire arena, and the only parts not covered by the union of n-2 spotlights are single points, then technically, the arena is not fully illuminated. But in reality, single points not being covered might not violate the &quot;fully illuminated&quot; condition if &quot;fully illuminated&quot; is interpreted as covering the entire area except for negligible sets. But the problem seems to require that the entire arena is illuminated, so even a single point being unlit would violate it.Therefore, to satisfy the problem&#39;s conditions, when two spotlights are turned off, there must be at least one region (not just a point) that is unlit. So maybe the witness regions for each pair are actual regions, not just points. However, the problem states that each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. So if two spotlights are turned off, the remaining spotlights fail to cover a convex region? Or maybe a non-convex region? But the unlit region could be non-convex.Alternatively, consider that when two spotlights are off, the intersection of their complements is non-empty, which is a region not covered by the remaining spotlights. Since the complements are non-convex (since the union of convex sets can be non-convex), but the intersection of two complements (which are convex, as complements of convex sets) would be convex? Wait, no. The complement of a convex set is not necessarily convex. For example, if the spotlight is a convex shape, its complement is the rest of the arena, which could be non-convex.Wait, the arena itself is a convex set? The problem doesn&#39;t specify, but each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. If the arena is convex, then the complement of each spotlight within the arena would also be convex? No, because the complement of a convex set within a convex arena can be non-convex. For example, if the arena is a square and the spotlight is a triangle covering half the square, the complement is the other half, which is convex. But if the spotlight is a strip through the center, the complement could be two separate regions, hence non-convex. So the complement of a convex set within a convex arena can be convex or non-convex depending on the shape.But if the intersection of two complements (i.e., the region not covered by either of two spotlights) must be non-empty for the second condition. That region is the intersection of two complements, which is the complement of the union of two convex sets. The union of two convex sets is not necessarily convex, so their complement can be complex.But perhaps we can model this with convex polygons. Suppose the arena is a regular n-gon, and each spotlight is a convex region that covers all but one edge. For example, each spotlight S_i covers the polygon except for a small segment near edge e_i. Then, if you remove one spotlight, the remaining spotlights cover all edges except possibly one, but if the segments are arranged such that each edge is excluded by exactly two spotlights, then removing two spotlights would leave two edges uncovered. Wait, but in a polygon, if two edges are uncovered, the area between them might still be covered by other spotlights. This is getting too vague.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of n=3. Suppose the arena is a triangle, and we have three spotlights. Each spotlight is a convex set that covers two edges of the triangle. For example, each spotlight is a lens-shaped region covering two edges and their common vertex. If you remove one spotlight, the other two cover all three edges (since each covers two edges, and the two together cover all three edges). But the entire triangle would be covered? Maybe not, because the central area might be covered by all three spotlights. If you remove two spotlights, the remaining one covers two edges but maybe not the center. Wait, but convex sets that cover two edges would likely cover the entire triangle. For example, if each spotlight is a quadrilateral covering two edges and their adjacent regions. Hmm.Alternatively, use the concept of the art gallery problem. In the art gallery problem, you need to place guards such that the entire polygon is covered. But this is different. However, maybe some insights can be borrowed. For example, a triangle requires one guard, but if we&#39;re talking about coverage with convex regions, maybe each guard is a convex region.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider n=3. If we can construct three convex sets in the plane (the arena) such that each two cover the entire arena, but each one alone does not. Wait, but the problem states that removing one still leaves it covered. Wait, no, in the problem, each spotlight is part of a covering where removing any one still leaves the arena covered, but removing any two does not. So for n=3, each single spotlight is redundant, but any two are not. So, three convex sets where each pair&#39;s union is the entire arena, but each single set is not. Then, the intersection of all three sets is non-empty? Wait, if the intersection of all three is non-empty, then any two sets would also have that intersection, so their union might not necessarily cover the entire arena. Hmm.Alternatively, if the three convex sets are such that each pair&#39;s union is the entire arena, but each set alone is not. For example, imagine three overlapping half-planes. Let the arena be a square. Let S1 be the left half, S2 the right half, and S3 the top half. Then, the union of any two is three-quarters of the square. So that doesn&#39;t work. Alternatively, S1 is the left two-thirds, S2 the middle two-thirds, and S3 the right two-thirds. Then, the union of any two is the entire square. But each alone is two-thirds. So here, n=3 is possible. Wait, yes! If the arena is a line segment, and each spotlight is a closed interval covering all but a unique point. Then, the union of any two intervals covers the entire segment, but each interval alone misses a point. But in one dimension, convex sets are intervals. So in 1D, for n=3, you can have three intervals each missing a different point, such that any two intervals cover the entire segment. For example, the segment [0, 3], and the intervals S1 = [0, 2], S2 = [1, 3], S3 = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3]. Wait, no, S3 is not convex in 1D (it&#39;s two disjoint intervals). Convex in 1D must be an interval. So, S1 = [0, 2], S2 = [1, 3], S3 = [0, 1.5] ∪ [2.5, 3] – no, still not convex. It seems in 1D, you can&#39;t have three intervals where each two cover the entire segment but each one alone does not. Because with two intervals, say [0, 2] and [1, 3], their union is [0, 3]. To have a third interval that, when combined with either, still covers [0, 3], it would have to cover the gaps. But if each interval alone must not cover [0, 3], then each must miss some part. But with three intervals, each missing a different part, but any two covering the entire segment. In 1D, this is possible if the length is divided such that each interval covers all but one of three equal parts. For example, the segment [0, 3], and each interval S1 = [0, 2], S2 = [1, 3], S3 = [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3]. Wait, but S3 is not convex. So in 1D, it&#39;s not possible. Therefore, maybe in 2D it is possible.In 2D, for n=3, consider three convex sets (like three overlapping rectangles) arranged such that each pair&#39;s union is the entire arena, but each alone is not. For example, let the arena be a square. Divide the square into three vertical strips. Each spotlight is a convex set covering two adjacent strips. Then, the union of any two spotlights would cover all three strips, hence the entire square. But each spotlight alone only covers two strips. Wait, but in this case, the spotlights are overlapping. But each is a convex set. For example, S1 covers the left two-thirds, S2 the middle two-thirds, and S3 the right two-thirds. Then, S1 and S2 together cover the entire square, as do S2 and S3, and S1 and S3? Wait, no. If S1 is left two-thirds, S3 is right two-thirds, their union covers all but the middle third between left two-thirds and right two-thirds, which might overlap. Wait, if the square is [0, 3] in x-axis, S1 is [0, 2], S2 is [1, 3], S3 is... Hmm, actually in 2D, extending this, S1 could be a vertical strip from x=0 to x=2, S2 from x=1 to x=3, and S3 could be a horizontal strip covering y=0 to y=2. Wait, no, then S1 and S2&#39;s union would cover x=0 to 3, but S3 covers y=0 to 2. The union of S1 and S3 would cover x=0-2 and y=0-2, plus x=1-3. Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe a better approach.Let the arena be a triangle. Let each spotlight be a set that covers two edges. For instance, each spotlight is a convex set that contains two edges but excludes the third. If we can arrange three convex sets, each covering two edges but missing the third, such that the union of any two covers all three edges. For example, if S1 covers edges AB and BC, S2 covers BC and CA, S3 covers CA and AB. Then, the union of any two spotlights covers all three edges. But does the union also cover the interior? If each spotlight is a &quot;wedge&quot; near two edges, their union might cover the entire triangle. For example, S1 is the region near AB and BC, S2 near BC and CA, S3 near CA and AB. If designed properly, the union of any two would cover the entire triangle. However, each individual spotlight would leave the opposite region uncovered. But in reality, convex sets near two edges would have overlapping regions, and their union might indeed cover the entire triangle. For example, if each spotlight is a rectangle extending from one vertex along two edges, their union might cover the triangle. This might work.But to verify, suppose the triangle has vertices A, B, C. S1 is the region containing edges AB and AC, but not BC. Wait, no. Each spotlight should cover two edges. So S1 covers AB and BC, S2 covers BC and CA, S3 covers CA and AB. If each S_i is the union of two edges and the area near them. However, convexity is important. If S1 is the convex hull of AB and BC, which would be the triangle itself. So that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, S1 is a convex set that includes AB and BC but not CA. But in a triangle, the convex hull of AB and BC is the entire triangle, so that&#39;s impossible. Therefore, maybe each S_i is a convex set that is very close to two edges but does not reach the third edge. For example, S1 is a strip along AB and BC, not reaching CA. Similarly for S2 and S3. Then, the union of S1 and S2 would cover strips along AB, BC, and CA, but might miss the center. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, use three overlapping convex sets arranged so that each pair&#39;s union is the entire arena. For example, three overlapping circles in a triangle formation, where each pair of circles covers the entire arena. But in practice, two circles can&#39;t cover the entire arena unless their centers are close. Maybe not.Alternatively, take the arena as a disk, and each spotlight as a sector of 240 degrees, arranged such that each pair of sectors covers the entire disk. For example, three sectors each offset by 120 degrees, each spanning 240 degrees. Then, any two sectors would cover 240 + 240 - 120 = 360 degrees, thus covering the entire disk. Each sector alone is 240 degrees, so doesn&#39;t cover the entire disk. Therefore, for n=3, this works. So in this case, n=3 is possible. Similarly, can this be extended to higher n?Wait, for a disk, if you have n sectors each spanning (360 - 360/n) degrees, arranged at regular intervals. Then, the union of any n-1 sectors would cover the entire disk, but the union of any n-2 sectors would leave a gap. Wait, let&#39;s check for n=4. If each sector is 270 degrees, spaced at 90-degree intervals. Then, removing one sector, the remaining three sectors each cover 270 degrees. The union of three 270-degree sectors spaced 90 degrees apart would cover the entire circle. Because each subsequent sector covers the gap of the previous ones. Wait, no. If you have four sectors at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, each spanning 270 degrees. If you remove the 0° sector, the remaining sectors are at 90°, 180°, 270°, each spanning 270 degrees. The 90° sector covers from 90° - 135° to 90° + 135°, i.e., -45° to 225°. The 180° sector covers 45° to 315°, and the 270° sector covers 135° to 405° (which is 135° to 45° after modulo 360). The union would be from -45° to 315°, plus 135° to 45°, which covers the entire circle. Similarly, removing any one sector, the remaining three cover the entire circle. However, if you remove two sectors, say 0° and 90°, the remaining two sectors at 180° and 270° each cover 270 degrees. The 180° sector covers 45° to 315°, and the 270° sector covers 135° to 45°. Their union covers 45° to 315°, plus 135° to 45°, which is 135° to 315°, missing the 315° to 135° arc (which is 180°). Wait, no: 45° to 315° is 270°, and 135° to 45° is also 270°, but their union is 135° to 315°, which is 180°, so half the circle is missing. Therefore, removing two sectors leaves half the circle uncovered. Therefore, this satisfies the problem&#39;s condition: removing one leaves it covered, removing two leaves it uncovered. Therefore, for n=4, this works.Similarly, for any n ≥ 2, arranging n sectors each spanning (360 - 360/n) degrees at regular intervals. Then, the union of any n-1 sectors would cover the entire disk, but the union of any n-2 sectors would not. Therefore, this construction works for any n ≥ 2.But wait, the problem specifies that each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. In the case of a disk arena, a sector of 240 degrees (for n=3) is a convex set, yes. Similarly, a 270-degree sector is convex. In general, a sector of angle (360 - 360/n) degrees is a convex set. Therefore, this construction works for any n ≥ 2.But the problem mentions a circus arena, which is likely a 2D shape, so the disk example is valid. However, the problem is tagged under &quot;Regular Polygons&quot;. Maybe the arena is a regular polygon, and the spotlights are arranged similarly. In a regular polygon with n sides, you can divide it into n regions, each covering all but one side, but arranged such that any n-1 regions cover the entire polygon. But similar to the disk case, if each spotlight is a convex region covering all but a 360/n degree segment, then any n-1 spotlights would cover the entire polygon.Wait, but in a regular polygon, arranging sectors like in the disk case might not work because the polygon has edges. However, if the arena is a regular polygon and each spotlight is a convex set covering all but one edge, then similar logic applies. For example, in a regular triangle, each spotlight covers two edges and the opposite region. If you remove one spotlight, the other two cover all three edges. But I need to ensure the entire area is covered. This might require a more careful construction.Alternatively, if the arena is a regular n-gon, and each spotlight is a convex set obtained by removing a small triangle near each vertex. If each spotlight S_i is the polygon minus a triangle near vertex v_i. Then, the union of all S_i is the entire polygon minus nothing, because each triangle is removed by one S_i, but covered by all others. Therefore, the union is the entire polygon. If you remove one S_i, then the triangle near v_i is not covered by the remaining S_j (j ≠ i), so the arena is not fully lit. Wait, but the problem states that removing one spotlight should still leave the arena fully lit. This contradicts. Therefore, this approach is flawed.Wait, going back to the disk example. If we model the arena as a disk and the spotlights as overlapping sectors, then the construction works for any n ≥ 2. Therefore, the answer would be &quot;for all n ≥ 2&quot;. But the problem is categorized under regular polygons, so maybe the answer is different. Wait, in the disk example, using sectors, it&#39;s possible for any n ≥ 2, but maybe for regular polygons, the answer is only possible when n is the number of sides of the polygon, or something else.But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the arena is a regular polygon, only that the tag includes regular polygons. Maybe the intended answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥ 2, using the disk/sector construction, and the regular polygon tag is a hint towards rotational symmetry.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a restriction when using regular polygons. For example, in a regular polygon with m sides, you can only have n spotlights if n divides m or something. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the arena is a regular polygon, just that the tag includes regular polygons. So perhaps the construction involves regular polygons.Alternatively, the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥ 2, because the disk/sector construction works. However, the problem might be in a planar arena with convex spotlights. In 2D, the sector example works for any n ≥ 2. Therefore, the answer is all positive integers n ≥ 2.But I need to confirm. Let&#39;s take n=4. Four sectors each spanning 270 degrees, placed at 90-degree intervals. Removing any one leaves three sectors whose union is the entire disk. Removing any two leaves two sectors whose union is half the disk. Therefore, this works. Similarly, n=5, five sectors each spanning 288 degrees, etc. So yes, this seems to work for any n ≥ 2.Therefore, the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all integers n ≥ 2.But the problem is in the context of a circus arena, which is likely a circle, so this construction works. However, the problem didn&#39;t specify the arena is a circle, but the tag includes regular polygons, which might suggest the arena is a regular polygon. However, even if the arena is a regular polygon, the sector construction (adapted to the polygon) would still work. For example, in a regular n-gon, each spotlight is a convex region covering all but one vertex&#39;s adjacent area. If arranged such that any n-1 spotlights cover the entire polygon, but any n-2 leave a region uncovered. This is possible using a similar sector-like approach. Therefore, regardless of the arena&#39;s shape (as long as it&#39;s convex), the construction is possible for any n ≥ 2.However, I recall that Helly&#39;s theorem might impose restrictions. For example, in Helly&#39;s theorem, if the intersection of every n-1 sets is non-empty, then the whole intersection is non-empty. But in our problem, it&#39;s about unions. But there&#39;s a dual Helly theorem for unions: if the union of any n-1 sets covers the whole space, then the union of all n sets also covers it. Which is trivial. But our problem is stronger: not only does the union of n-1 sets cover the space, but the union of n-2 does not. However, Helly&#39;s theorem doesn&#39;t directly apply here.Another thought: in the plane, the maximum number of convex sets you can have such that the union of any n-1 is the whole plane, but the union of any n-2 is not, is unbounded. The sector example shows that you can have any n. Therefore, the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥ 2.But to confirm, let&#39;s check n=2. Two spotlights. Each must cover the entire arena when combined. If one is turned off, the other must still cover the arena. But the problem states that if any two are turned off, the arena is dark. But with n=2, turning off both leaves nothing, which is correct. But in this case, each spotlight individually must cover the arena. So if each spotlight alone covers the arena, then their union trivially does too, and turning off one still leaves the other. But the problem states that &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; For n=2, turning off both is the only way, which indeed leaves it dark. So n=2 is possible.But wait, in the sector example for n=2, each sector would be a half-disk (180 degrees). Their union is the entire disk. Each half-disk alone covers half the disk. Wait, but the problem says that if one spotlight is turned off, the arena is still fully illuminated. But if each spotlight is a half-disk, turning off one leaves only the other half-disk, which only covers half the arena. So this contradicts. Therefore, my previous sector example for n=2 doesn&#39;t work.Wait, this is a problem. In the sector example for n=2, two half-disks: if each is a semicircle, their union is the whole disk, but each alone is a semicircle. Therefore, turning off one leaves a semicircle, so the arena is only half illuminated. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s first condition. Therefore, my previous reasoning was flawed for n=2.Wait, so maybe n=2 is not possible? Let&#39;s check.If n=2, we need two convex sets whose union is the arena. Additionally, turning off one leaves the other, which must still cover the arena. Therefore, each convex set alone must cover the arena. Therefore, their union is redundant. Therefore, n=2 is possible only if each spotlight alone covers the arena, which is trivial. For example, two identical spotlights each covering the entire arena. But then, turning off one still leaves the other, so the arena is lit. Turning off both leaves it dark. Therefore, n=2 is possible if both spotlights individually cover the arena. But the problem states &quot;Each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape.&quot; If &quot;illuminates a certain convex shape&quot; means that the union of all spotlights is the arena, but each individually is a convex shape. If they are both the entire arena, then yes. But the problem says &quot;It is known that if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; So if n=2, turning off one still leaves it fully lit, which requires that each spotlight alone covers the arena. Then, turning off two (both) makes it dark. So yes, n=2 is possible. For example, two spotlights both covering the entire arena. But then, each is redundant. However, in that case, the problem&#39;s second condition is trivially satisfied because there&#39;s no case of turning off two spotlights except both. But technically, it works.However, in the problem statement, it says &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;. So if the spotlights are both covering the entire arena, then yes. Therefore, n=2 is possible. However, in the sector example for n=2, it doesn&#39;t work, but that&#39;s a different construction. The key is that for n=2, you can have two spotlights that each individually cover the entire arena. Therefore, n=2 is possible.But the problem says &quot;it is known that if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; So for n=2, turning off both is the only way to turn off two, which results in darkness, so it&#39;s okay. So n=2 is possible.For n=3, as per the previous example with three sectors of 240 degrees in a circle, each covering 240 degrees. Then, the union of any two covers the entire circle. Each individual sector covers 240 degrees, so removing one sector leaves the union of the other two, which cover the entire circle. Removing two sectors leaves one sector covering 240 degrees, so part of the circle is dark. However, wait, if each spotlight is a 240-degree sector, then individually, they cover 240 degrees. The union of two 240-degree sectors, offset by 120 degrees, covers 240 + 240 - 120 = 360 degrees. Yes, so their union is the entire circle. Therefore, n=3 is possible. Similarly, for n=4, four 270-degree sectors, each pair&#39;s union covers the entire circle.But in the case of n=2, if each spotlight is the entire arena, then the union is the entire arena. Removing one still leaves the entire arena lit by the other. Removing both makes it dark. So that&#39;s okay. However, the problem might be looking for a non-trivial case where each spotlight is not the entire arena. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that. It just says each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape. If the convex shape can be the entire arena, then n=2 is possible.But maybe the problem implies that the spotlights are non-trivial, i.e., none of them individually cover the entire arena. Because if they do, then the problem becomes trivial for any n. For example, if you have n spotlights, each covering the entire arena, then turning off any n-1 still leaves at least one, which covers the arena. Turning off all n makes it dark. But the problem says &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; Which would not hold, because if you have more than two spotlights, turning off two still leaves others. Therefore, the problem implicitly requires that each spotlight is necessary in the sense that the union of all except one covers the arena, but the union of all except two does not. Therefore, each spotlight is redundant (you can remove one), but not two.Therefore, in this case, for n=2, if both spotlights individually cover the arena, then turning off one still leaves it lit, turning off both makes it dark. Therefore, n=2 is possible, but in this case, the spotlights are trivial (each covers the entire arena). For n≥3, the spotlights need to be non-trivial. The sector example works for n≥3, where each spotlight is a proper subset of the arena.But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the spotlights must be proper subsets. Therefore, technically, n=2 is possible with each spotlight being the entire arena. For n≥3, you can have both trivial and non-trivial solutions. However, the problem might be intending non-trivial solutions where each spotlight is a proper subset. In that case, n=2 would not be possible, because two proper subsets whose union is the arena would require that each subset covers more than half the arena. But in the case of convex sets, if two convex sets cover the arena, then their intersection is non-empty by Helly&#39;s theorem (for two sets, the intersection is non-empty if their union is the entire space and they are convex). Wait, Helly&#39;s theorem requires more sets. Wait, in Helly&#39;s theorem, for two convex sets, if their union is the whole space and they are disjoint, then they can&#39;t both be convex. Therefore, if two convex sets cover the plane, they must intersect. But in our case, the arena is a bounded convex set. If two convex sets cover a bounded convex arena, they must intersect. Therefore, for n=2, if you have two convex sets covering the arena, their intersection is non-empty. But each convex set individually does not cover the arena. However, the problem states that removing one leaves the arena still lit, which would require that the remaining convex set covers the arena. Therefore, for n=2, it&#39;s impossible to have two non-trivial convex sets where each individually covers the arena. Because if two convex sets cover the arena and their union is the arena, then each must individually cover the arena. Otherwise, their union cannot be the arena. Wait, no. For example, in 1D, two intervals [0,1] and [0.5, 1.5] cover [0, 1.5]. Each individually does not cover the entire interval, but their union does. But in this case, their intersection is [0.5, 1], so they overlap. However, in higher dimensions, two convex sets can cover a space without either individually covering it. For example, two overlapping squares covering a larger square. Each individually is a smaller square, but together they cover the larger square.Wait, but in the problem&#39;s case, the arena is the entire space being considered. If the arena is a larger square, and the two convex sets are two smaller squares whose union is the larger square, then each individually does not cover the arena. However, in this case, the problem&#39;s first condition is that removing one leaves the arena still covered. But if the two sets are the only ones, removing one leaves the other, which does not cover the arena. Therefore, this contradicts. Therefore, for n=2, you cannot have two non-trivial convex sets where each is necessary for coverage. Because if their union is the arena, then removing one leaves the other, which is not the arena. Therefore, n=2 is only possible if both convex sets individually cover the arena, making them trivial.Therefore, the problem&#39;s answer depends on whether trivial spotlights (each covering the entire arena) are allowed. If they are, then any n ≥ 2 is possible. If not, then n must be ≥3, but with non-trivial convex sets. However, the problem does not specify this restriction. In mathematics problems, unless specified, trivial solutions are usually considered valid. Therefore, the answer would be all n ≥ 2. But wait, let&#39;s double-check.If n=2 is allowed with trivial spotlights, then yes. But in the problem&#39;s second condition, &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated&quot;. For n=2, turning off both (the only two) results in darkness. So it&#39;s okay. However, the problem might be more interesting if considering non-trivial spotlights. But since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, we have to consider both possibilities.But let&#39;s think again about the sector example for n=3. In that case, each spotlight is a non-trivial convex set (a 240-degree sector), and the conditions are satisfied. For n=2, the trivial solution works. But is there a non-trivial solution for n=2? As above, in 1D, it&#39;s not possible. In 2D, imagine two overlapping convex sets whose union is the arena, but neither individually covers it. But according to Helly&#39;s theorem, if two convex sets cover a convex arena, their intersection must be non-empty. However, that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t cover the arena. For example, two overlapping rectangles covering a larger rectangle. Each individually is a smaller rectangle, but their union is the larger one. However, in this case, removing one leaves the other, which doesn&#39;t cover the arena. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s first condition. Therefore, for n=2, non-trivial spotlights cannot satisfy the problem&#39;s conditions. Therefore, n=2 is only possible with trivial spotlights.But the problem says &quot;Each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify that the convex shape must be a proper subset. Therefore, if spotlights can illuminate the entire arena, then n=2 is possible. However, the problem might be expecting spotlights to be non-trivial. If so, then n=2 is impossible, and the answer is n ≥3. But how to determine which is the case?Looking back at the problem statement: &quot;It is known that if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; For n=2, the only way to satisfy the first condition is if each spotlight alone covers the arena. Therefore, the problem allows for n=2. However, the second condition is only about turning off two spotlights, which for n=2 means turning off both, resulting in darkness. Therefore, according to the problem&#39;s wording, n=2 is possible.Similarly, for higher n, using the sector example, you can have non-trivial spotlights. Therefore, the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥ 2. However, I need to verify this with the regular polygon tag.The problem is categorized under &quot;Regular Polygons&quot;. If the arena is a regular polygon, then the spotlights must be convex sets within it. For a regular polygon, constructing non-trivial spotlights for n=2 might not be possible. For example, in a regular polygon, two convex sets whose union is the entire polygon, but each individually does not cover it. As above, in 2D, two overlapping convex sets can cover a convex arena without either individually covering it. For example, two overlapping rectangles covering a larger rectangle. Each individually is a smaller rectangle, but their union is the larger one. However, if the arena is the larger rectangle, then this is possible. But in a regular polygon, say a hexagon, two convex sets can cover the hexagon if they are arranged appropriately. However, the key is that removing one leaves the other, which does not cover the arena. Therefore, this would not satisfy the problem&#39;s first condition. Therefore, in the case of a regular polygon arena, n=2 is impossible with non-trivial spotlights. However, if the spotlights are allowed to be trivial (each covering the entire arena), then n=2 is possible. But the problem might be intending the arena to be a regular polygon and the spotlights to be non-trivial convex subsets, making n=2 impossible.This is getting quite complicated. The key issue is whether trivial spotlights are allowed. Since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, but in mathematical problems, usually, non-trivial solutions are sought unless stated otherwise. However, in the absence of such a specification, we must consider both.But given that the problem states &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;, for n=2, this implies that each spotlight alone must cover the arena, hence they are trivial. Therefore, for non-trivial spotlights, n must be ≥3. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify non-triviality. Therefore, technically, the answer is all integers n ≥2.But I need to reconcile this with the problem&#39;s tags: Pairings and Groups; Bijections, Regular Polygons, Examples and Counterexamples. Constructions. The mention of Regular Polygons might hint that the solution involves regular polygons, and the answer is related to the number of sides. For example, in a regular n-gon, you can have n spotlights arranged such that each corresponds to a side or vertex, and the conditions are met. But how?Alternatively, consider that each spotlight corresponds to a vertex of a regular n-gon, and the coverage is such that each spotlight&#39;s region is the polygon minus a region near its corresponding vertex. Then, the union of all spotlights covers the entire polygon (since each vertex&#39;s region is covered by all spotlights except the one corresponding to it). If you remove one spotlight, the remaining n-1 spotlights cover all vertices, hence the entire polygon (assuming the regions near the vertices are small). If you remove two spotlights, the regions near their corresponding vertices are uncovered. But this requires that the regions near the vertices are only covered by their corresponding spotlights. However, if the spotlights are convex, then the regions near the vertices must be convex, which might not be possible if they are small and near a vertex.Alternatively, each spotlight is a convex set that covers all but one edge of the polygon. Then, the union of all spotlights covers the entire polygon (since each edge is covered by all spotlights except one). If you remove one spotlight, the remaining spotlights cover all edges (since each edge is only excluded by one spotlight). However, the union of convex sets covering all edges would not necessarily cover the entire polygon&#39;s interior. For example, in a triangle, if each spotlight covers two edges, their union might leave the center uncovered. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, each spotlight is a triangle formed by two adjacent edges and a diagonal. But ensuring convexity and coverage is tricky.Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the lack of progress on connecting it to regular polygons, I think the sector example in a circular arena (which is a regular polygon with infinite sides) works for any n ≥2. Therefore, the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥2. However, the problem&#39;s mention of regular polygons might imply that the answer is related to regular polygons&#39; properties, such as n being the number of sides. For example, in a regular n-gon, such a configuration is possible only if n is a prime number or something else. But I can&#39;t think of a reason why.Alternatively, in a regular n-gon, the minimal number of convex sets needed to cover it such that each set is redundant is n. But I don&#39;t know.Wait, another angle: the problem requires that the intersection of any two spotlights&#39; complements is non-empty. In other words, for any two spotlights, there&#39;s a point not covered by either. But in a regular polygon, how many such points can you have? For n spotlights, you need C(n,2) such points. But in a regular n-gon, the number of vertices is n. So unless C(n,2) ≤ n, which implies n ≤3. But C(3,2)=3, which equals the number of vertices. For n=4, C(4,2)=6 &gt;4. Therefore, if the arena is a regular n-gon, the number of witness points needed is C(n,2), which exceeds the number of vertices for n ≥4. Therefore, this suggests that it&#39;s only possible for n=3 if the arena is a triangle. For n=3, the three witness points can be the three vertices. Each pair of spotlights excludes one vertex. Therefore, the union of all three spotlights covers all vertices, and removing one spotlight leaves two, which still cover all vertices (since each vertex is excluded by only one spotlight). However, as before, covering the vertices doesn&#39;t ensure covering the entire polygon. If each spotlight covers two edges but not the third vertex, their union might not cover the entire triangle.But if the arena is a triangle and each spotlight is a convex set covering two edges and the opposite vertex, then each spotlight is a set containing two edges and the opposite vertex. The union of all three spotlights would be the entire triangle. Removing one spotlight leaves two, which cover all three edges (each spotlight covers two edges, two spotlights cover four edges, but the triangle only has three edges). Therefore, the union of two spotlights covers all three edges. But does it cover the entire triangle? If each spotlight is the union of two edges and the opposite vertex, then their union would cover the edges and the vertices, but the interior might not be covered. For example, the centroid might not be covered. Therefore, this approach might not work.Given the time I&#39;ve invested and the lack of a definitive connection to regular polygons, I think the correct answer is that it&#39;s possible for all n ≥2, based on the sector example in a circular arena. The tags might be misleading, or the regular polygon reference might be a red herring. Alternatively, the answer is that it&#39;s possible only for n ≥3, considering that for n=2, the spotlights must be trivial, which might not be in the spirit of the problem. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify non-triviality.Given the problem&#39;s statement and standard mathematical problem conventions, I think the answer is that it&#39;s possible for all integers n ≥2. Therefore, the final answer is:boxed{n geq 2}Final AnswerThe possible values of ( n ) are all integers greater than or equal to 2, so the answer is boxed{n geq 2}.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the values of ( n ) for which a circus arena can be illuminated by ( n ) different spotlights, each covering a convex shape, such that turning off any one spotlight still fully illuminates the arena, but turning off any two spotlights does not.Key steps and reasoning:1. Understanding the Conditions:   - If one spotlight is turned off, the remaining ( n-1 ) spotlights must still cover the entire arena.   - If two spotlights are turned off, the remaining ( n-2 ) spotlights do not cover the entire arena.2. Convex Sets and Coverage:   - Each spotlight illuminates a convex shape.   - The union of all ( n ) spotlights covers the entire arena.   - Each point in the arena must be covered by at least two spotlights to satisfy the first condition.   - For any two spotlights, there must be a point covered only by those two, ensuring the second condition.3. Example Construction:   - Consider the arena as a disk and the spotlights as sectors of the disk.   - For ( n ) spotlights, each sector spans ( 360 - frac{360}{n} ) degrees.   - The union of any ( n-1 ) sectors covers the entire disk, but the union of any ( n-2 ) sectors leaves a gap.4. Verification for Different ( n ):   - ( n = 2 ): Each spotlight covers the entire arena. Turning off one leaves the other, which still covers the arena. Turning off both leaves it dark.   - ( n geq 3 ): Using the sector construction, each pair of sectors covers the entire arena when combined, but removing two leaves a gap.5. Conclusion:   - The construction works for any ( n geq 2 ) using sectors in a circular arena or similar convex shapes in a regular polygon setup.   - The problem does not restrict the arena to a specific shape, allowing the use of convex sets like sectors.Final Answer:[boxed{n geq 2}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a circus arena with n different spotlights. Each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. The key conditions here are:1. If any one spotlight is turned off, the arena is still fully illuminated.2. If any two spotlights are turned off, the arena is no longer fully illuminated.We need to figure out for which values of n this setup is possible.First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Each spotlight covers a convex region. The union of all these regions covers the entire arena. If we remove any one spotlight, the union of the remaining regions still covers the entire arena. But if we remove any two spotlights, there&#39;s at least some part of the arena that isn&#39;t covered. So, each spotlight is somehow &quot;critical&quot; in the sense that losing one is okay, but losing two isn&#39;t.This reminds me of redundancy in covering sets. Each individual spotlight is redundant because the others can cover for it, but pairs of spotlights are not redundant. So, the system is 1-redundant but not 2-redundant. In covering problems, this relates to concepts like covering numbers and redundancy. But since each set here is convex, there might be some geometric constraints.Now, convex sets have the property that the intersection of convex sets is also convex. However, the union of convex sets is not necessarily convex. But in this case, the entire arena is illuminated, which might be a convex or non-convex region. But the arena is just a region; the problem doesn&#39;t specify it&#39;s convex. Wait, actually, a circus arena is typically a circle or some regular shape, maybe convex. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm. However, each spotlight illuminates a convex shape. So, regardless of the arena&#39;s shape, the union of convex sets must cover it.But maybe the arena itself is convex? Let me check the problem statement again. It says the spotlights illuminate &quot;the arena,&quot; which is a &quot;circus arena.&quot; A circus arena is usually a circular area, which is convex. So, perhaps the arena is a convex region, and the spotlights are convex regions whose union is the arena. But the key is that each spotlight is a convex set, and their union is the entire arena.Given that, the problem reduces to: Find n convex subsets of a convex region (the arena) such that every n-1 subsets cover the entire arena, but every n-2 subsets do not. So, we need such a configuration.I need to find for which n this is possible. The question is asking for possible n. So, maybe there&#39;s a minimal n, or n has to be within certain numbers.First, let&#39;s think of small n and see if they are possible.n=1: If there&#39;s only one spotlight, then turning it off would leave the arena dark. But the problem says that if one is turned off, the arena is still illuminated. So n=1 is impossible.n=2: With two spotlights. If we turn off one, the other should illuminate the arena. But if we turn off both, obviously it&#39;s dark. However, the problem states that if any two are turned off, it&#39;s not illuminated, which in this case, n=2, turning off two spotlights would leave none. So technically, yes, but the first condition says that turning off one still leaves it illuminated. But for n=2, each spotlight alone must cover the entire arena. Because if you turn off one, the other must cover it. Therefore, both spotlights individually cover the entire arena. But then, their union is redundant, but actually, each is sufficient. So, if you have two spotlights each covering the entire arena, then turning off one still leaves the other. But then, turning off two spotlights (which are both) would leave the arena dark. So, n=2 is possible? Wait, but the problem says that each spotlight illuminates a &quot;certain convex shape&quot;. If each convex shape is the entire arena, then yes. But the problem says &quot;different&quot; spotlights. Does different mean that their illuminated regions are different? If so, then if each is the entire arena, they are not different. Hmm. Wait, the problem states &quot;n different spotlights&quot;. Maybe &quot;different&quot; just means distinct, but they could still cover the same area. But in typical mathematical problems, different usually implies distinct in some meaningful way. If the problem allows spotlights with identical coverage, then n=2 is possible, but if &quot;different&quot; implies their illuminated regions are different, then perhaps n=2 is not possible. Hmm, the problem says &quot;different spotlights&quot;, but maybe it just means distinct spotlights, not necessarily that their illuminated regions are different. The problem doesn&#39;t specify. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous.Wait, the problem says &quot;each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape&quot;. It doesn&#39;t say that the shapes are different. So, perhaps the spotlights can have overlapping or even identical shapes. But in reality, different spotlights would be in different positions, so their illuminated regions would be different. But maybe in the problem&#39;s abstraction, they can be the same. Hmm. The problem states &quot;n different spotlights&quot;, which might just mean n distinct spotlights, but their illuminated regions could be the same or different.But if the illuminated regions can be the same, then n=2 is possible: just have two spotlights each covering the entire arena. Then, turning off one leaves the other, which still covers the arena. Turning off both makes it dark. However, the problem says &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated&quot;. So, for n=2, turning off both spotlights (which are the only two) would leave the arena dark, so that&#39;s okay. But in that case, each spotlight alone covers the arena, so their intersection is the entire arena. But in that case, each is redundant. However, the problem states that the arena is illuminated by n different spotlights, each illuminating a convex shape. If all n spotlights individually cover the entire arena, then turning off any n-1 would still leave at least one spotlight, which covers the arena. But turning off n would leave none. Wait, but in the problem, when you turn off two, you need the arena not to be illuminated. For n=2, turning off two spotlights (i.e., all) leaves the arena dark. So, technically, that satisfies the conditions. However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s required that &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated&quot;. For n=2, there&#39;s only one pair of spotlights to turn off, which are both, resulting in darkness. So, n=2 might be possible.But wait, the problem might be intending that when you turn off two spotlights, there are still others left. So, perhaps n must be at least 3? Because for n=2, turning off two leaves zero, but maybe the problem wants that even with some remaining spotlights, the coverage is incomplete. Hmm. The problem states: &quot;if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated&quot;. So, if you have n spotlights, turning off any two, the remaining n-2 spotlights do not cover the arena. For n=2, turning off two leaves zero, which is not covering, so n=2 is okay. For n=3, turning off two leaves one, which must not cover the arena. So, each single spotlight cannot cover the arena. But in the problem statement, when you turn off one spotlight, the remaining n-1 must cover the arena. So, for n=3, each pair of spotlights must cover the arena, but each single spotlight does not. Therefore, for n=3, each spotlight alone does not cover the arena, but any two together do. Similarly, for n=4, each trio covers the arena, but any two do not.Wait, this is starting to sound like a covering problem where the covering number is n-1, meaning you need at least n-1 sets to cover the arena, but n-2 are insufficient. So, such a covering has covering number n-1. So, in covering theory, the covering number is the minimum number of sets needed to cover the space. Here, the covering number would be n-1, but given that the entire n sets cover it, but each n-1 also cover it. Wait, but no. Wait, the problem says that if you remove one, it&#39;s still covered (so covering number is at most n-1), and if you remove two, it&#39;s not covered (so covering number is exactly n-1). Therefore, the covering number is n-1. So, such a system exists if and only if the covering number of the space by these convex sets is n-1, and the space cannot be covered by fewer than n-1 sets. However, we need to find for which n this is possible.But in the plane (assuming the arena is 2-dimensional), how do convex sets interact in terms of covering numbers? This might relate to Helly&#39;s theorem, which deals with intersections of convex sets. Helly&#39;s theorem states that for a finite number of convex sets in R^d, if the intersection of every d+1 of them is non-empty, then the whole intersection is non-empty. But here, we are dealing with unions, not intersections. There is a dual concept called the &quot;covering problem,&quot; but I don&#39;t recall a direct theorem for that.Alternatively, maybe think in terms of examples. Let&#39;s try to construct such a system for small n.For n=2: As discussed, if both spotlights individually cover the entire arena, then turning off one still leaves the other. But if you turn off both, it&#39;s dark. However, does this satisfy the problem&#39;s conditions? The problem states that &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;, which is true here. &quot;But if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated&quot;, which is also true. So, n=2 is possible.But wait, if each spotlight alone covers the arena, then they are redundant. But the problem allows for that. However, in some interpretations, maybe the problem implies that each spotlight is necessary in the sense that their union is the arena, but individually they are not. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t state that. It just says that the union of all spotlights covers the arena, and the union of any n-1 also covers it, but the union of any n-2 does not. So, if n=2, union of both is the arena, union of either one is the arena, union of none is not. But in that case, n=2 is possible. However, maybe the problem wants that each spotlight is necessary for the coverage when combined with others, but individually they might not cover the arena. Wait, but in the n=2 case, each spotlight alone does cover the arena. So, perhaps the answer includes n=2. But maybe the problem&#39;s phrasing is slightly different. Let me check again.The problem says: &quot;It is known that if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two arbitrary spotlights are turned off, the arena will no longer be fully illuminated.&quot; So, in the n=2 case, turning off one leaves one, which still illuminates the arena. Turning off two leaves none, which doesn&#39;t. So, it satisfies both conditions. Therefore, n=2 is possible.Similarly, for n=3, we need that any two spotlights cover the arena, but any single one does not. So, for n=3, each spotlight alone does not cover the arena, but any two together do. Is such a configuration possible with convex sets?Let&#39;s think in 2D. Suppose the arena is a square. Let&#39;s divide it into three convex regions such that each region alone does not cover the entire square, but any two together do. How?One approach is to have each spotlight cover the square minus a different small triangle. But convexity is important. If we remove a triangle from the square, the remaining set is not convex. So, that approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe arrange three convex sets such that each is a strip covering the square but missing a different part. For example, three rectangles arranged vertically, horizontally, and diagonally? Wait, but overlapping in such a way that any two cover the entire square.Alternatively, think of three sectors of a circle. If the arena is a circle, and each spotlight illuminates a 240-degree sector. Then, any single sector would miss a 120-degree portion, but any two sectors would cover the entire circle. Wait, let&#39;s check:If each spotlight covers a 240-degree sector, then the intersection of two such sectors would be 240 + 240 - 360 = 120 degrees. Wait, no. The union of two 240-degree sectors would cover the entire circle only if their arcs overlap sufficiently. If the three sectors are arranged at 120-degree angles from each other, then each pair would cover 240 + 240 - 120 (overlap) = 360 - 120 = 240? Wait, no. Let&#39;s visualize.Imagine a circle divided into three 120-degree arcs. Each spotlight covers two of these arcs, i.e., 240 degrees. Then, each spotlight alone misses one 120-degree arc. However, any two spotlights would cover all three arcs, because each spotlight covers two arcs, and the two spotlights together would cover all three. For example, spotlight A covers arcs 1 and 2, spotlight B covers arcs 2 and 3, spotlight C covers arcs 1 and 3. Then, any two spotlights would cover all three arcs. So, their union is the entire circle. But each alone misses one arc. So, this seems to work.Moreover, each spotlight&#39;s coverage is a convex set because in a circle, a 240-degree sector is convex (any two points in the sector can be connected by a line segment within the sector). So, this configuration satisfies the conditions for n=3.Similarly, for n=4, can we have four convex sets where any three cover the arena, but any two do not? Let&#39;s try to extend the previous idea. If we have four spotlights, each missing a different 90-degree arc (since the circle is 360 degrees). Each spotlight covers 270 degrees. Then, any three spotlights would cover 270*3 - overlaps. Wait, but if each is missing a different 90-degree arc, then the union of three would cover all arcs except possibly the intersection of their missing arcs. Wait, no. If each spotlight misses a unique 90-degree arc, then the union of three spotlights would miss only the one 90-degree arc that&#39;s missed by all three. But since each misses a different arc, the union of three would miss none? Wait, no. Let me think.If there are four different 90-degree arcs, each missed by one spotlight. If I take three spotlights, each misses one of the four arcs. So, the three spotlights together would miss the one arc that is not missed by any of the three. Wait, if there are four arcs, each missed by one spotlight, then three spotlights would cover all arcs except the one that&#39;s missed by the fourth spotlight, which is not among the three. Wait, no. Let me try to clarify.Suppose the circle is divided into four 90-degree arcs: A, B, C, D. Each spotlight misses one arc:- Spotlight 1 misses A- Spotlight 2 misses B- Spotlight 3 misses C- Spotlight 4 misses DThen, the union of spotlights 1, 2, 3 would cover A (from 2,3,4?), no. Wait:Wait, spotlight 1 covers B, C, DSpotlight 2 covers A, C, DSpotlight 3 covers A, B, DSpotlight 4 covers A, B, CSo, if we take spotlights 1, 2, 3:- Spotlight 1 covers B, C, D- Spotlight 2 covers A, C, D- Spotlight 3 covers A, B, DTogether, they cover A (from 2,3), B (from 3), C (from 1,2), D (from all). So, yes, the union is the entire circle. Similarly, any three spotlights would cover the entire circle. But if we take two spotlights, say 1 and 2:- Spotlight 1 covers B, C, D- Spotlight 2 covers A, C, DTogether, they cover A, B, C, D. Wait, that&#39;s the entire circle. Hmm, so this doesn&#39;t work. The union of two spotlights already covers everything. So, this approach doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition that two spotlights turned off would leave the arena not fully illuminated.Wait, so this method doesn&#39;t work for n=4. Maybe another approach is needed.Alternatively, if we have each spotlight missing two different arcs? But then the coverage would be smaller. Wait, perhaps if the arena is divided into more arcs. Let&#39;s say we divide the circle into n arcs, each missed by one spotlight. For n=3, as before, each misses one 120-degree arc, and any two cover everything. For n=4, if we divide the circle into four 90-degree arcs, but each spotlight misses two arcs. Wait, but then the coverage is 270 degrees, but if each misses two arcs, that&#39;s 180 degrees. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, maybe use convex polygons. If the arena is a square, perhaps arrange four spotlights as rectangles each covering three sides but missing one. But similar to the circle idea, but in a square. However, in such a case, the union of two might still cover the entire square.Alternatively, think in terms of hyperplanes. In higher dimensions, convex sets can be half-spaces. But in 2D, half-planes. If we cover the arena (a convex polygon) with half-planes. For example, if the arena is a polygon, and each spotlight corresponds to a half-plane. The intersection of all half-planes is the arena. Wait, but the problem is about unions, not intersections. So, using half-planes as spotlights whose union is the arena.But half-planes are convex, and their union can be the entire plane, but if the arena is a bounded region, then maybe arranging half-planes such that their union covers the arena. However, turning off one half-plane might still leave the rest covering the arena. But it&#39;s tricky.Alternatively, think of the spotlights as triangles covering the arena. If you have n triangles whose union is the arena, such that any n-1 also cover it, but n-2 do not. However, constructing such triangles would require careful arrangement.Wait, perhaps using the idea of &quot;covering the circle with arcs&quot; as a model. For n=3, it worked by having each spotlight miss a unique arc, and any two covering the whole circle. For higher n, maybe similar ideas can be extended. But in the previous attempt with n=4, dividing the circle into four arcs and each spotlight missing one arc resulted in two spotlights still covering the whole circle. So, that approach doesn&#39;t work. Perhaps instead, each spotlight must miss more than one arc, but how?Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem in terms of set theory. Each spotlight corresponds to a convex set. The union of all n sets is the arena. The union of any n-1 sets is also the arena. The union of any n-2 sets is not the arena.This is similar to the concept of a &quot;critical hypergraph&quot; where each edge is critical for the covering. In our case, each pair of spotlights is critical in the sense that their removal destroys the covering.But how does this relate to convex sets? Maybe in the plane, we can have such configurations only up to a certain n. For example, in 2D, Helly&#39;s theorem says that if the intersection of every three sets is non-empty, then the whole intersection is non-empty. But we are dealing with unions.Wait, there&#39;s a theorem related to covering numbers with convex sets. I recall that for a family of convex sets in the plane, if every three of them have a point in common, then there&#39;s a point common to all. But again, that&#39;s about intersections, not unions.Alternatively, think about the dual problem: instead of covering the arena with convex sets, consider the points not covered by the spotlights. If the union of all spotlights is the arena, then the intersection of their complements is empty. The condition that removing any one spotlight still leaves the arena covered means that the complement of each spotlight is contained in the union of the other spotlights. Similarly, removing any two spotlights leaves some part of the arena uncovered, which means that the intersection of the complements of those two is not contained in the union of the remaining spotlights.But this seems abstract. Let me formalize:Let S_1, S_2, ..., S_n be convex sets covering the arena A (a convex set). The conditions are:1. For every i, S_1 ∪ ... ∪ S_{i-1} ∪ S_{i+1} ∪ ... ∪ S_n = A.2. For every i ≠ j, S_1 ∪ ... ∪ S_{i-1} ∪ S_{i+1} ∪ ... ∪ S_{j-1} ∪ S_{j+1} ∪ ... ∪ S_n ≠ A.In terms of complements within A:Let C_i = A  S_i. Then:1. For every i, the intersection of all C_j for j ≠ i is empty. Because if you remove S_i, the remaining S_j cover A, so there&#39;s no point in A that&#39;s not in any S_j for j ≠ i. Thus, the intersection of all C_j for j ≠ i is empty.2. For every i ≠ j, there exists a point in C_i ∩ C_j that is not in any other C_k. Because if you remove S_i and S_j, the remaining S_k do not cover A, so there exists a point in A not covered by any S_k with k ≠ i,j, i.e., a point in C_i ∩ C_j that is not in any other C_k.This resembles the concept of a &quot;k-fold covering&quot; but in reverse. However, the conditions here are about the complements forming an (n-1)-wise empty intersection but with pairs having non-empty intersections not covered by others.This structure is similar to the concept of a &quot;sperner family&quot; or &quot;antichain,&quot; but again, in a geometric setting.Alternatively, consider that the complements C_i must satisfy:- Every (n-1) of the C_i have empty intersection.- Every (n-2) of the C_i have a non-empty intersection, which is not contained in the union of the remaining two C_k&#39;s.Wait, maybe not exactly. Let&#39;s see. If we take n-2 complements C_{i1}, ..., C_{i(n-2)}, their intersection should contain a point not in any of the remaining two C_j&#39;s. That is, there exists a point in ∩_{k=1}^{n-2} C_{ik} that is not in C_j for j ≠ i1, ..., i(n-2). But since the union of all S_j covers A, the complements C_j must cover the entire space outside A, but within A, the union of S_j is A, so the intersection of all C_j (within A) is empty.This is getting too abstract. Maybe think of an example.For n=3, as we discussed earlier, the complements C_i are each a 120-degree arc. The intersection of any two C_i&#39;s is empty, because if you take two C_i&#39;s, each is a 120-degree arc, but arranged such that their union is 240 degrees, and the third S_i covers the remaining 120. Wait, no. Wait, in the previous example, each C_i is a 120-degree arc. The intersection of two C_i&#39;s would be the overlap of two 120-degree arcs. If the arcs are arranged such that each C_i is a different 120-degree arc, then two C_i&#39;s would be adjacent or not? Wait, no. If the circle is divided into three 120-degree arcs, each C_i is one of those arcs. Then, the intersection of any two C_i&#39;s is empty because each C_i is a distinct arc. Wait, that can&#39;t be. If the circle is divided into three arcs, and each C_i is one arc, then the intersection of two C_i&#39;s would be empty, since they are distinct arcs. But in our earlier reasoning, we said that the union of two S_i&#39;s (each being the complement of C_i) would cover the entire circle. But if each S_i is the circle minus a 120-degree arc, then the union of two S_i&#39;s would be the circle minus the intersection of the two C_i&#39;s. But if the two C_i&#39;s are disjoint, then their intersection is empty, so the union of the two S_i&#39;s would be the entire circle. Wait, but if the three C_i&#39;s are three different 120-degree arcs, then any two C_i&#39;s are disjoint, so their intersection is empty. Therefore, the union of two S_i&#39;s is the entire circle minus the intersection of two C_i&#39;s, which is empty, so the union is the entire circle. Hence, that works.But in this case, the complements C_i are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, their intersections are empty. Therefore, the first condition is satisfied: the intersection of any n-1=2 C_i&#39;s is empty. Because each C_i is a distinct arc, and any two are disjoint. Then, the union of the other two S_i&#39;s covers the entire circle. Similarly, for n=3, this works.But if we try to extend this to n=4, we need four C_i&#39;s such that any three have empty intersection, but any two have non-empty intersection. Wait, but if the C_i&#39;s are pairwise disjoint, then any two have empty intersection, which contradicts the requirement. So, this approach doesn&#39;t extend.Alternatively, maybe make the C_i&#39;s overlap in a controlled way. For n=4, we need that the intersection of any three C_i&#39;s is empty, but the intersection of any two C_i&#39;s is non-empty and not contained in the union of the remaining two C_j&#39;s. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s formalize the general case. For the problem, the requirements translate to:1. For every i, the intersection of all C_j for j ≠ i is empty. (Because the union of S_j for j ≠ i covers A, so there&#39;s no point in A that&#39;s in all C_j for j ≠ i.)2. For every i ≠ j, there exists a point x in C_i ∩ C_j that is not in any C_k for k ≠ i,j. (Because when you remove S_i and S_j, the remaining S_k don&#39;t cover x, so x is in C_i ∩ C_j and not in any other C_k.)This structure is similar to a &quot;2-wise intersecting&quot; family where every pair of sets intersects, but no three sets have a common intersection. Moreover, each pair&#39;s intersection is unique in some way.In combinatorics, this is analogous to a family of sets where every pair has a unique point of intersection, and no point is in more than two sets. This is similar to a Steiner system, specifically S(2, k, v), but not exactly. However, in our case, the sets are the C_i&#39;s, which are subsets of A (the arena). Each pair of C_i&#39;s must intersect in at least one point not covered by any other C_k. If we can assign a unique point to each pair of C_i&#39;s, then this would satisfy the conditions. However, since we&#39;re dealing with convex sets in the plane, there are geometric constraints.In the plane, if the C_i&#39;s are closed convex sets, then their intersections are also convex. If each pair of C_i&#39;s must intersect in at least one point, but no three C_i&#39;s intersect, this is similar to the concept of &quot;kissing&quot; convex sets, where each pair touches at a single point. However, arranging multiple convex sets in the plane such that each pair intersects at a unique point, and no three have a common intersection, is challenging.For example, consider four convex sets in the plane. Can we arrange them such that each pair intersects in a unique point, and no three intersect? Yes, but they have to be arranged carefully. For instance, four convex polygons each sharing a common edge with another, but arranged so that each pair intersects only at a single point. However, convexity complicates this.Alternatively, think of four triangles arranged such that each pair shares a different vertex, but no three share a vertex. But in the plane, with four triangles, it&#39;s hard to avoid three-way intersections.Alternatively, use line segments. If each C_i is a line segment, but in the plane, two line segments can intersect at most once. If we arrange four line segments such that each pair intersects at a unique point, and no three intersect at the same point. This is possible, but line segments are 1-dimensional, and their complements would be the rest of the arena. However, the problem requires the C_i&#39;s to be the parts not covered by the spotlights, which are convex. If the spotlight regions are convex, then their complements (within the arena) are also convex only if the spotlight regions are half-planes. Wait, no. The complement of a convex set in the arena is not necessarily convex. For example, if the arena is a square and a spotlight illuminates a triangle inside it, the complement is the square minus the triangle, which is not convex.Therefore, the C_i&#39;s (complements of the spotlights) are not necessarily convex, unless the spotlight regions are half-planes. So, if we model the spotlights as half-planes, their complements would also be half-planes (the opposite side). But arranging half-planes such that their union is the entire arena (a convex set), and the conditions hold.Suppose the arena is the entire plane. Wait, but the arena is a circus arena, which is bounded. Let&#39;s assume the arena is a convex polygon. If we use half-planes as spotlights, each half-plane covers an infinite region, but their intersection with the arena would be a convex set (a half-plane intersected with a convex polygon is convex). However, the union of several half-planes can cover the entire arena.For example, if the arena is a square, and each spotlight is a half-plane that covers all but one edge of the square. If we have four half-planes, each missing one edge, then the union of all four covers the entire square. If you remove one half-plane, the remaining three still cover the square (since each covers three edges). If you remove two half-planes, the remaining two might not cover the square. Wait, let&#39;s check:Suppose each spotlight is a half-plane that includes three edges of the square but excludes one. For example:- Spotlight 1 excludes the top edge.- Spotlight 2 excludes the right edge.- Spotlight 3 excludes the bottom edge.- Spotlight 4 excludes the left edge.Each spotlight alone covers the square minus one edge. The union of all four covers the entire square. If we remove one spotlight, say Spotlight 1, the remaining three cover the square minus the top edge, but Spotlight 2, 3, and 4: does their union cover the top edge? Spotlight 2 excludes the right edge, so it includes the top, left, and bottom. Spotlight 3 excludes the bottom edge, so it includes the top, right, and left. Spotlight 4 excludes the left edge, so it includes the top, right, and bottom. Together, their union includes the top edge (from Spotlights 2,3,4), right edge (from 3,4), bottom edge (from 2,4), and left edge (from 2,3). So yes, the union of three spotlights covers the entire square. Similarly, any three spotlights cover the entire square. But if we remove two spotlights, say 1 and 2, then the remaining two are 3 and 4. Spotlight 3 covers top, right, left; Spotlight 4 covers top, right, bottom. Together, they cover top, right, left, bottom. Wait, that&#39;s the entire square. So, this doesn&#39;t work. Removing two spotlights still covers the square. Hence, this approach fails.Alternatively, maybe use more spotlights. Suppose each spotlight is a half-plane that excludes a different vertex of the square. For example, each spotlight covers the square minus a small triangle near a vertex. But these complements are not convex. Hence, this approach is invalid.Alternatively, use spotlights that are convex sets within the square such that each excludes a different edge. But as before, the union of three might still cover the square.Hmm, this is tricky. Let&#39;s consider that in the plane, the maximum n for which such a configuration is possible is 3. Because for n=3, we can use three 240-degree sectors as spotlights, each missing a 120-degree arc, and their pairwise unions cover the circle. For n=4, we tried to extend this idea but ran into issues where two spotlights already cover the arena. Maybe in the plane, due to the nature of convex sets, you can&#39;t have more than three sets with this property.Wait, but Helly&#39;s theorem says that for a family of convex sets in R^d, if the intersection of every d+1 sets is non-empty, then the whole intersection is non-empty. But we are dealing with unions. However, there is a theorem related to unions of convex sets. I recall that if the union of a family of convex sets in R^d is convex, then the nerve of the family is acyclic. But I&#39;m not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, consider that in the plane, if you have four convex sets, their union covering the arena, and such that any three also cover it, but any two do not. Is this possible?Suppose the arena is a square. Let&#39;s try to construct four convex sets.Each convex set must miss a different part of the square. Let&#39;s divide the square into four regions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Each spotlight covers three of these regions but misses one. However, convexity complicates this.For example, if a convex set misses the top-left corner, it must be entirely below or to the right of some line. But such a set would also miss other parts. Wait, perhaps each spotlight is a quadrant. For instance:- Spotlight 1: everything except the top-left quadrant.- Spotlight 2: everything except the top-right quadrant.- Spotlight 3: everything except the bottom-left quadrant.- Spotlight 4: everything except the bottom-right quadrant.Each of these is a convex set (since they are the union of three quadrants, which is convex?). Wait, no. The union of three quadrants is not convex. For example, everything except the top-left quadrant would be the union of the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants. However, connecting a point in the top-right to a point in the bottom-left would pass through the top-left quadrant, which is not included. Hence, this set is not convex. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, use half-planes. Suppose each spotlight is a half-plane that cuts off a corner of the square. For example, four half-planes each shaving off a different corner. Then, the union of all four half-planes would cover the entire square except the four corners. Wait, but we need the union to cover the entire square. So, this is not helpful.Alternatively, think of four convex sets, each covering three edges of the square but missing one. But as before, the union of three might still cover the square.Wait, maybe a different approach. Suppose each spotlight is a triangle covering most of the square but missing a different small triangle. For example, each spotlight is a large triangle with a small triangular hole. However, the complement (the hole) would not be convex, but the spotlight&#39;s illuminated area is the square minus the hole. If the hole is convex, then the illuminated area is not convex. Hence, this is invalid.Alternatively, each spotlight illuminates a convex region that covers all but a different line segment on the boundary of the square. For example, each spotlight excludes a different edge. But as discussed earlier, the union of three such spotlights would still cover the entire square.This suggests that in the plane, it might not be possible to have n ≥ 4. Because arranging four convex sets such that any three cover the arena, but any two do not, is geometrically impossible. However, I need to verify this.Suppose we have four convex sets S1, S2, S3, S4 covering the arena A. Suppose that any three of them cover A, but any two do not. So, for any pair Si, Sj, there is a point p_{ij} in A not covered by Si or Sj, but covered by the other two. But in the plane, the points p_{ij} must lie in the intersections of the complements of Si and Sj. However, since each p_{ij} is covered by the other two spotlights, it must lie in Sk ∩ Sl for some k, l ≠ i,j.But with four spotlights, how many such points p_{ij} are there? For four spotlights, there are six pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4). Each pair (i,j) has a point p_{ij} not covered by Si or Sj, but covered by the other two. So, p_{12} must be in S3 ∩ S4, p_{13} must be in S2 ∩ S4, p_{14} must be in S2 ∩ S3, p_{23} must be in S1 ∩ S4, p_{24} must be in S1 ∩ S3, p_{34} must be in S1 ∩ S2.Now, consider the points p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}. These points are in S3 ∩ S4, S2 ∩ S4, S2 ∩ S3 respectively. Similarly, other points are in different intersections.But in the plane, the intersection of convex sets is convex. So, S3 ∩ S4 is a convex set containing p_{12}, S2 ∩ S4 is a convex set containing p_{13}, etc. However, arranging six such points in the intersections of pairs of convex sets, ensuring that no three convex sets share a common point (since if they did, that point would be covered by three spotlights, contradicting the requirement that removing two spotlights leaves it uncovered). Wait, no. The points p_{ij} are covered by exactly two spotlights, so they must lie in exactly two sets.But if we have four convex sets in the plane, it&#39;s possible that their pairwise intersections are non-empty, but no three have a common intersection. This is similar to the earlier idea. In fact, such a configuration is possible. For example, arrange four convex sets such that each pair intersects but no three have a common intersection. This is called a &quot;3-Helly&quot; family, where every three sets have an empty intersection, but each pair intersects. Such families exist in the plane.For example, consider four convex polygons arranged such that each pair overlaps, but no three overlap. Then, their union covers the entire arena. If we define the arena as the union of these four sets, then any three sets cover the arena (since their union is the same as the union of all four), but this contradicts the requirement. Wait, no. If the union of all four is the arena, then the union of any three is a subset of the arena, but not necessarily the entire arena. However, if the four convex sets are such that each is necessary for the coverage, then removing one would leave a part uncovered. But the problem states that removing one still leaves it covered. So, this is the opposite.Wait, no. The problem says that removing one leaves it covered (union of n-1 covers the arena), but removing two leaves it uncovered (union of n-2 does not cover). So, for n=4, the union of any three convex sets must cover the arena, but the union of any two does not. So, similar to n=3 case but with one more set.However, in the plane, can we have four convex sets where any three cover the arena, but any two do not?This seems challenging. Let&#39;s think of an example. Suppose the arena is a square. Let&#39;s define four convex sets:1. S1: covers the entire square except a small triangle near the top-left corner.2. S2: covers the entire square except a small triangle near the top-right corner.3. S3: covers the entire square except a small triangle near the bottom-left corner.4. S4: covers the entire square except a small triangle near the bottom-right corner.Each S_i is convex because it&#39;s the square minus a triangle, but wait, the complement of a triangle in a square is not convex. For example, if you remove a triangle from the square, the remaining set is not convex. Therefore, S_i would not be convex. Hence, this approach is invalid.Alternatively, make each S_i a convex region that misses a different corner. For instance, use four convex sets each shaped like a rectangle covering three sides of the square but missing a corner. However, such a set would not be convex. For example, a rectangle missing a corner is not convex because you can connect two points around the missing corner with a line that goes through the missing area.Alternatively, use four convex sets each missing a different edge. For example, each S_i is a vertical or horizontal strip covering most of the square but missing an edge. But as before, the union of three such strips might still cover the entire square.Alternatively, think of four convex sets arranged like a cross. Each set covers three arms of the cross but misses one. However, ensuring convexity here is difficult.Wait, here&#39;s an idea inspired by the n=3 case. Suppose the arena is a circle, and we use four convex sets, each missing a different 90-degree arc. Then, each S_i is a 270-degree sector. The union of all four S_i&#39;s covers the entire circle. If we remove one S_i, the remaining three S_j&#39;s each cover 270 degrees, but since the missing arcs are 90 degrees each, do three S_j&#39;s cover the entire circle?Let&#39;s see. Suppose each S_i misses a unique 90-degree arc. Then, the union of three S_i&#39;s would cover the circle minus the intersection of the three missing arcs. But if each S_i misses a different arc, the intersection of three missing arcs is empty. Therefore, the union of three S_i&#39;s would cover the entire circle. However, the union of two S_i&#39;s would cover the circle minus the intersection of their two missing arcs. If the missing arcs are arranged such that any two missing arcs overlap by 45 degrees, then the union of two S_i&#39;s would miss 45 degrees. But if the missing arcs are non-overlapping, then the union of two S_i&#39;s would miss 90 + 90 - overlap = 180 degrees if adjacent, or 180 degrees if opposite. Wait, no. If the four missing arcs are each 90 degrees, spaced every 90 degrees around the circle, then each S_i covers 270 degrees. The union of two S_i&#39;s would cover 270 + 270 - overlap. The overlap between two S_i&#39;s is 270 + 270 - 360 = 180 degrees. So, the union of two S_i&#39;s covers 270 + 270 - 180 = 360 degrees. Wait, that can&#39;t be right. Let me calculate:The formula for the union of two sets is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.If each S_i is a 270-degree arc, then the intersection of two S_i&#39;s is 270 + 270 - 360 = 180 degrees. Therefore, the union is 270 + 270 - 180 = 360 degrees. So, two S_i&#39;s already cover the entire circle. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work for n=4, because turning off two spotlights would still leave the arena covered. Hence, this method fails.This suggests that the circle sector approach works for n=3 but not for higher n. Therefore, perhaps the maximal n for which this is possible is 3. But wait, what about higher dimensions? The problem doesn&#39;t specify the arena is 2D. If the arena is 3D, maybe we can have higher n. But the problem mentions a circus arena, which is typically 2D. However, the problem doesn&#39;t explicitly restrict it to 2D. But since spotlights illuminate convex shapes, which in 3D would be convex bodies. However, the problem might be intended for 2D.Assuming 2D, based on the above attempts, n=2 and n=3 are possible, but n=4 is not. To confirm this, let&#39;s consider n=4 in 2D. Suppose we have four convex sets where any three cover the arena, but any two do not. For each pair of spotlights, there&#39;s a region covered only by the other two. In 2D, this would require that each pair of spotlights has a unique region that only the other two cover. However, with four spotlights, there are six such pairs, each requiring a unique region. But in 2D, arranging four convex sets such that each pair has a unique region not covered by them seems difficult due to the planar geometry constraints. This is similar to the problem of finding four convex sets in the plane where each pair has a unique intersection point not shared by any other pair, which is known to be impossible due to the combinatorial explosion of required regions.In graph theory terms, if each pair of spotlights corresponds to a unique region, the number of regions grows quadratically with n, but the number of possible regions arranged by convex sets in the plane is limited. For n=4, we would need six unique regions, each corresponding to a pair of spotlights, which is not feasible with convex sets in the plane.Therefore, the conclusion is that such configurations are possible only for n=2 and n=3 in 2D. However, we saw that for n=2, the spotlights can each individually cover the arena, but the problem allows that as long as they are different spotlights. However, the problem states &quot;each spotlight illuminates a certain convex shape&quot;. If &quot;different&quot; spotlights are required to have different illuminated regions, then for n=2, both spotlights would need to cover the entire arena, making their illuminated regions identical. If &quot;different&quot; spotlights implies different regions, then n=2 would not be possible unless the two spotlights have different convex regions whose union is the arena, but each alone also covers the arena. This would require that both spotlights individually cover the arena, which is possible if their regions are the entire arena. However, if &quot;different&quot; implies that their illuminated regions are different, then it&#39;s impossible, as the only way for two different convex sets to each cover the arena is if their union is also the arena, but their individual sets must be different. However, two different convex sets can both cover the arena. For example, two overlapping rectangles covering the entire arena but shifted slightly. However, in such a case, each rectangle alone covers the arena, so turning off one still leaves the other. But their illuminated regions are different. Therefore, n=2 is possible if &quot;different&quot; allows their regions to be different but both covering the arena.However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s stated that &quot;if one arbitrary spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated&quot;. This can happen even if the spotlights have different regions, as long as each region alone covers the arena. Therefore, for n=2, having two different spotlights each covering the entire arena satisfies the conditions. Hence, n=2 is possible.For n=3, we can use the circle sectors as described, which are different convex sets, each missing a different 120-degree arc, but any two covering the entire circle. This satisfies the conditions.For n=4, as discussed, constructing such convex sets seems impossible in 2D. Therefore, the possible values of n are 2 and 3.Wait, but wait. Let me check for n=3 again. If we have three convex sets in the plane where each two cover the entire arena, but each single one does not. This is possible with the circle sectors. Now, what about n=4? Is it possible in 3D? Suppose the arena is a 3D sphere, and each spotlight illuminates a hemisphere. Then, any three hemispheres cover the entire sphere, but any two leave a circle uncovered. However, hemispheres are convex in 3D. But the problem mentions a circus arena, which is typically 2D. However, if we consider a 3D arena, then yes, n=4 is possible. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify the dimension. However, since spotlights in a circus arena are typically mounted above and illuminate a 2D area, it&#39;s safer to assume 2D.Therefore, in 2D, possible n are 2 and 3, but in 3D, higher n might be possible. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify, and considering standard circus arenas are 2D, we can conclude that n=2 and n=3 are possible.Wait, but wait. In the 2D case, n=3 is possible, but what about higher n? Maybe using a different configuration. For example, using convex polygons arranged such that each is a half-plane missing a different part. However, as we saw earlier, in 2D, two half-planes can cover the entire space, so n=4 would require a different approach.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the dual hypergraph. Each spotlight corresponds to a hyperedge covering all points except those in its complement. The conditions require that the hypergraph is such that every n-1 hyperedges cover the entire set, but no n-2 do. This is similar to a covering code or a certain type of incidence structure. However, without a specific structure theorem, it&#39;s hard to say.Another angle: think of the problem as each spotlight&#39;s complement being a minimal set with respect to inclusion. For the union of any n-1 spotlights to cover the arena, the complement of each spotlight must be contained in the intersection of the other n-1 spotlights&#39; complements. Wait, no. Actually, the complement of each spotlight (the part not illuminated by it) must be covered by the union of the other spotlights. So, for each i, C_i ⊆ ∪_{j≠i} S_j. But since the arena is covered by ∪_{j≠i} S_j, C_i is contained within that union, which means C_i ⊆ ∪_{j≠i} S_j. But since C_i is the part not covered by S_i, and the union of the other S_j covers C_i, that makes sense.For the second condition, when removing two spotlights, there exists a point not covered by the remaining n-2. So, for each pair i,j, there exists x in C_i ∩ C_j not covered by any S_k with k≠i,j. Therefore, x ∈ C_i ∩ C_j and x ∉ S_k for any k≠i,j. But since x ∈ C_i, it&#39;s not in S_i, and similarly not in S_j. But x must be in the arena, so x must be in the arena but not in any S_k for k≠i,j. Therefore, such an x exists only if the union of S_k for k≠i,j does not cover the arena, which is the second condition.This structure is similar to the concept of a &quot;critical&quot; family in covering problems, where each element is critical in the sense that its removal destroys the covering property. However, here, it&#39;s pairs of elements that are critical.In geometry, there&#39;s a concept called &quot;k-coverings&quot;, where every point is covered by at least k sets. Here, it&#39;s slightly different because we&#39;re dealing with union covers rather than intersection covers. But if we think in terms of redundancy, the system is 1-redundant (can tolerate one failure) but not 2-redundant.In coding theory, this resembles codes with certain redundancy properties. However, the connection is tenuous.Returning to the original question: For which n is this possible? From the examples and attempts above, in 2D, n=2 and n=3 are possible. For n=4, it&#39;s not possible due to geometric constraints. Therefore, the answer is n=2 and n=3.But wait, let&#39;s verify n=3 again. Suppose we have three convex sets (spotlights) in the plane, such that any two cover the arena, but any single one does not. As we discussed, three 240-degree sectors in a circular arena missing 120-degree arcs each. This works. Similarly, in a square arena, we can arrange three convex sets each missing a different third of the square. For example, divide the square into three vertical strips, each spotlight covering two strips. But each strip is a rectangle, which is convex. If each spotlight covers two adjacent strips, then any two spotlights would cover all three strips. But each single spotlight would miss one strip. However, the union of two spotlights would cover the entire square. Therefore, this also works. Hence, n=3 is possible.For example, divide the square into three vertical strips: left, middle, right. Each spotlight covers two adjacent strips:- S1 covers left and middle.- S2 covers middle and right.- S3 covers left and right.Wait, but S3 covers left and right, missing the middle. But if the middle is a strip, then S3 would be two disconnected parts, which is not convex. Therefore, this approach fails.Alternatively, arrange the three convex sets as horizontal half-planes, vertical half-planes, and another orientation. But it&#39;s difficult.Alternatively, use three convex sets arranged like a Venn diagram. For example, three overlapping rectangles arranged such that each pair&#39;s union covers the entire square, but each single rectangle does not. However, ensuring that each single rectangle does not cover the entire square is possible if each rectangle is missing a different part. For example, each rectangle covers three sides of the square but misses one. But as before, ensuring convexity and that the union of any two covers the square.Alternatively, three large triangles arranged such that each covers most of the square but misses a corner. However, the union of any two triangles would cover the square. But each triangle alone would miss a corner. However, the complement (the missed corner) is not convex, but the spotlight&#39;s coverage is convex. For example, each triangle is a convex set covering the square minus a corner. However, the union of two triangles would cover the entire square. For example, triangle1 covers all but the top-left corner, triangle2 covers all but the top-right corner, triangle3 covers all but the bottom-left corner. The union of triangle1 and triangle2 covers all but the bottom-left and bottom-right corners. Wait, no. Each triangle covers three corners. So, the union of two triangles would cover five corners? Wait, no. A square has four corners. Each triangle covers three, so the union of two triangles covers all four corners. Wait, no. If triangle1 covers three corners (say, top-left, top-right, bottom-right), missing the bottom-left. Triangle2 covers three corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left), missing the bottom-right. Their union covers all four corners. However, the entire square is the convex hull of the four corners, so if the union of two triangles covers all four corners, does it cover the entire square? Yes, because any point in the square is a convex combination of the corners, which are covered by the union. However, the union of two convex sets covering the corners may not necessarily cover the entire square. For example, consider two triangles covering three corners each but missing different ones. The union might not cover the entire square because the line segments connecting the corners might not be fully covered.For instance, if triangle1 covers top-left, top-right, bottom-right (missing bottom-left), and triangle2 covers top-left, top-right, bottom-left (missing bottom-right), then the union of triangle1 and triangle2 covers all four corners. However, the center of the square is covered by both triangles, but the line segment from bottom-left to bottom-right is partially covered: the segment from bottom-left to center is covered by triangle2, and from center to bottom-right is covered by triangle1. Therefore, the entire bottom edge is covered. Similarly, other edges are covered. Therefore, the union of the two triangles covers the entire square. Hence, this configuration works. Each triangle is convex, any two cover the square, and each alone misses a corner. Therefore, n=3 is possible.For n=4, attempting a similar approach with four triangles each missing a different corner fails because the union of three triangles would cover all four corners, hence the entire square, but we need the union of any three to cover the square, which it does, but the union of any two must not cover the square. However, in this case, the union of two triangles does cover the square, as shown above. Hence, this approach doesn&#39;t work.Therefore, in 2D, n=2 and n=3 are possible, but n=4 is not. Hence, the answer is that such configurations are possible for n=2 and n=3.Final AnswerThe values of ( n ) for which this is possible are boxed{2} and boxed{3}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the values of ( n ) for which it is possible to illuminate a circus arena with ( n ) different spotlights such that turning off one spotlight still fully illuminates the arena, but turning off two spotlights does not, we analyze the problem as follows:1. Understanding the Problem:   - Each spotlight illuminates a convex shape.   - The union of all spotlights covers the entire arena.   - Removing any one spotlight leaves the arena fully illuminated.   - Removing any two spotlights leaves the arena not fully illuminated.2. Key Insights:   - The system must be 1-redundant (each spotlight is redundant) but not 2-redundant.   - This relates to covering the arena with convex sets where each set is critical in pairs.3. Case Analysis:   - ( n = 2 ):     - Two spotlights each covering the entire arena. Turning off one leaves the other, which still covers the arena. Turning off both leaves the arena dark. This satisfies the conditions.   - ( n = 3 ):     - Three convex sets (e.g., 240-degree sectors of a circle) where each pair covers the entire arena, but each single set does not. This configuration works and satisfies the conditions.   - ( n geq 4 ):     - Constructing such configurations in 2D becomes geometrically challenging. The union of three sets would cover the arena, but pairs would not. This is shown to be infeasible due to the constraints of convex sets in the plane.4. Conclusion:   - In 2D, the problem constraints can be satisfied for ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ). Higher values of ( n ) are not feasible due to geometric limitations. Final AnswerThe values of ( n ) for which this is possible are boxed{2} and boxed{3}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8b13bc3f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8b13bc3f><span class="icon" data-v-8b13bc3f>🔑:</span>For n=2 this is obviously possible.

All the smaller circles are pairwise tangent to each other and also tangent to the large circle. Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. There&#39;s a big circle, and inside it, there are three smaller circles. Two of them have radius r, one has radius 2r. They all touch each other and the big circle. I need to figure out how their centers are arranged and use that to find the ratio.First, since all three smaller circles are tangent to the large circle, their centers must lie inside the large circle, each at a distance of R minus their own radius from the center of the large circle. So, for the circle with radius 2r, the distance from the center of the large circle to its center would be R - 2r. Similarly, for the two circles with radius r, their centers would be at a distance of R - r from the center of the large circle.Now, the three smaller circles are also pairwise tangent to each other. That means the distance between the centers of any two smaller circles should be equal to the sum of their radii. Let&#39;s denote the centers of the three smaller circles as A (radius 2r), B (radius r), and C (radius r). The distances between each pair of centers should be:- Distance between A and B: 2r + r = 3r- Distance between A and C: 2r + r = 3r- Distance between B and C: r + r = 2rSo, the centers A, B, and C form a triangle where two sides (AB and AC) are each 3r, and the third side (BC) is 2r. Additionally, each of these centers is located at a distance from the center of the large circle (let&#39;s call that center O). So, points O, A, B, C all have some geometric relationship.Wait, since all three smaller circles are inside the large circle and tangent to it, their centers lie on the same plane, and their positions relative to the center of the large circle must form some sort of symmetric arrangement? Let&#39;s think. If two of the small circles are radius r and one is 2r, maybe the two radius r circles are symmetric with respect to the line joining the center of the large circle and the center of the 2r circle?Alternatively, maybe all three centers form a triangle (as above) and this triangle is positioned such that each vertex is at a certain distance from O. Since OA = R - 2r, OB = R - r, OC = R - r. So points B and C are both at a distance of R - r from O, and point A is at a distance of R - 2r from O.So, we have triangle ABC with sides AB = 3r, AC = 3r, BC = 2r, and points A, B, C located in the plane such that OA = R - 2r, OB = OC = R - r. Hmm, perhaps we can model this with coordinate geometry.Let me try to place the centers in a coordinate system. Let&#39;s set the center O of the large circle at the origin (0,0). Let&#39;s place center A (radius 2r) along the x-axis at (d, 0), where d = R - 2r. Then centers B and C (each radius r) will be located somewhere in the plane such that their distance from O is R - r, and their distance from A is 3r, and their distance from each other is 2r.Since the problem is symmetric with respect to the x-axis (assuming we place center A on the x-axis), centers B and C should be mirror images across the x-axis. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates of center B as (x, y) and center C as (x, -y). Then, we can write the following equations:1. Distance from O to B: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = R - r2. Distance from A to B: sqrt((x - d)^2 + y^2) = 3r3. Distance from B to C: sqrt((x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2) = 2r =&gt; sqrt( (2y)^2 ) = 2r =&gt; 2|y| = 2r =&gt; |y| = rSo from equation 3, y = r or y = -r. But since we placed B at (x, y) and C at (x, -y), we can take y = r.So now, we can substitute y = r into equations 1 and 2.Equation 1: sqrt(x^2 + r^2) = R - rEquation 2: sqrt((x - d)^2 + r^2) = 3rWe also know that d = R - 2r.So let&#39;s substitute d into equation 2.Equation 2 becomes sqrt((x - (R - 2r))^2 + r^2) = 3rLet me square both sides of equations 1 and 2 to eliminate the square roots.From equation 1:x^2 + r^2 = (R - r)^2Expanding the right side:x^2 + r^2 = R^2 - 2Rr + r^2Subtract r^2 from both sides:x^2 = R^2 - 2RrTherefore, x = sqrt(R^2 - 2Rr)But since we are dealing with coordinates, and considering the center B should be to the left or right of center A. Hmm, if center A is at (d, 0) = (R - 2r, 0), then center B is at (x, r). Depending on the value of x, this could be to the left or right. Let&#39;s proceed.From equation 2, after squaring:(x - (R - 2r))^2 + r^2 = 9r^2Simplify:(x - R + 2r)^2 + r^2 = 9r^2Subtract r^2 from both sides:(x - R + 2r)^2 = 8r^2Take square roots:x - R + 2r = ±sqrt(8) r = ±2√2 rTherefore, x = R - 2r ± 2√2 rBut let&#39;s think about the physical placement. The center A is at (R - 2r, 0). The centers B and C are at (x, r) and (x, -r). If x is greater than R - 2r, then center B would be to the right of center A, but since all centers must be inside the large circle, maybe that&#39;s possible. But let&#39;s check both possibilities.Case 1: x = R - 2r + 2√2 rCase 2: x = R - 2r - 2√2 rBut from equation 1, x^2 + r^2 = (R - r)^2So let&#39;s substitute x from Case 1 into equation 1.Case 1:x = R - 2r + 2√2 rThen x^2 = [R - 2r + 2√2 r]^2= [R + r(-2 + 2√2)]^2= R^2 + 2R * r(-2 + 2√2) + r^2(-2 + 2√2)^2So plug into equation 1:x^2 + r^2 = R^2 - 2Rr + r^2Therefore,[R^2 + 2R * r(-2 + 2√2) + r^2(-2 + 2√2)^2] + r^2 = R^2 - 2Rr + r^2Simplify the left side:R^2 + 2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r^2[(-2 + 2√2)^2 + 1] = R^2 - 2Rr + r^2Subtract R^2 from both sides:2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r^2[(-2 + 2√2)^2 + 1] = -2Rr + r^2Let&#39;s compute (-2 + 2√2)^2:= (-2)^2 + (2√2)^2 + 2*(-2)*(2√2)= 4 + 8 - 8√2= 12 - 8√2So, (-2 + 2√2)^2 + 1 = (12 - 8√2) + 1 = 13 - 8√2Therefore, left side becomes:2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r^2(13 - 8√2) = -2Rr + r^2Bring all terms to left side:2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r^2(13 - 8√2) + 2Rr - r^2 = 0Factor terms:2Rr[(-2 + 2√2) + 1] + r^2[(13 - 8√2) - 1] = 0Simplify coefficients:For Rr term:(-2 + 2√2) + 1 = -1 + 2√2For r^2 term:13 - 8√2 - 1 = 12 - 8√2Thus:2Rr(-1 + 2√2) + r^2(12 - 8√2) = 0Divide both sides by r (assuming r ≠ 0):2R(-1 + 2√2) + r(12 - 8√2) = 0Solve for R:2R(-1 + 2√2) = -r(12 - 8√2)Multiply both sides by -1:2R(1 - 2√2) = r(12 - 8√2)Then:R = [r(12 - 8√2)] / [2(1 - 2√2)]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: 12 - 8√2 = 4(3 - 2√2)Denominator: 2(1 - 2√2) = 2(1 - 2√2)So:R = [4(3 - 2√2) r] / [2(1 - 2√2)]Simplify 4/2 = 2:R = [2(3 - 2√2) r] / (1 - 2√2)Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:Denominator: 1 - 2√2Conjugate: 1 + 2√2Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + 2√2):R = [2(3 - 2√2)(1 + 2√2) r] / [(1 - 2√2)(1 + 2√2)]Compute denominator:(1)^2 - (2√2)^2 = 1 - 8 = -7Numerator:2*(3 - 2√2)(1 + 2√2)First compute (3 - 2√2)(1 + 2√2):= 3*1 + 3*2√2 - 2√2*1 - 2√2*2√2= 3 + 6√2 - 2√2 - 4*(√2)^2= 3 + 4√2 - 4*2= 3 + 4√2 - 8= -5 + 4√2Multiply by 2:2*(-5 + 4√2) = -10 + 8√2Thus,R = (-10 + 8√2) r / (-7)Multiply numerator and denominator by -1:R = (10 - 8√2) r / 7Therefore,R = (10 - 8√2)/7 * rTherefore, r/R = 7/(10 - 8√2)Again, rationalize the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by (10 + 8√2):r/R = 7*(10 + 8√2) / [(10 - 8√2)(10 + 8√2)]Denominator:10^2 - (8√2)^2 = 100 - 64*2 = 100 - 128 = -28Numerator:7*(10 + 8√2) = 70 + 56√2Thus,r/R = (70 + 56√2)/(-28)Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 14*(5 + 4√2)Denominator: -28Simplify 14/-28 = -1/2Therefore,r/R = - (5 + 4√2)/2But this is a negative value, which doesn&#39;t make sense because radii are positive. So, this suggests that Case 1 might not be feasible. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the sign or the direction. Let&#39;s check Case 2.Case 2: x = R - 2r - 2√2 rSo x = R - 2r - 2√2 r = R - r(2 + 2√2)Then, x^2 = [R - r(2 + 2√2)]^2Plug into equation 1:x^2 + r^2 = (R - r)^2So:[R - r(2 + 2√2)]^2 + r^2 = (R - r)^2Expand the left side:= R^2 - 2Rr(2 + 2√2) + r^2(2 + 2√2)^2 + r^2Right side:= R^2 - 2Rr + r^2Subtract right side from left side:[R^2 - 2Rr(2 + 2√2) + r^2(2 + 2√2)^2 + r^2] - [R^2 - 2Rr + r^2] = 0Simplify:-2Rr(2 + 2√2) + r^2(2 + 2√2)^2 + r^2 + 2Rr - r^2 = 0Simplify term by term:First term: -2Rr(2 + 2√2)Second term: r^2*(2 + 2√2)^2Third term: + r^2Fourth term: +2RrFifth term: - r^2Combine like terms:-2Rr(2 + 2√2) + 2Rr + r^2*( (2 + 2√2)^2 + 1 - 1 )Wait, actually, the terms:Third term + fifth term: r^2 - r^2 = 0Second term: r^2*(2 + 2√2)^2Fourth term: +2RrFirst term: -2Rr(2 + 2√2)So overall:-2Rr(2 + 2√2) + 2Rr + r^2*(2 + 2√2)^2 = 0Factor Rr and r^2 terms:Rr[ -2(2 + 2√2) + 2 ] + r^2*(2 + 2√2)^2 = 0Compute inside the brackets:-2(2 + 2√2) + 2 = -4 - 4√2 + 2 = -2 -4√2Thus,Rr(-2 -4√2) + r^2*(2 + 2√2)^2 = 0Compute (2 + 2√2)^2:= 4 + 8√2 + 8 = 12 + 8√2Therefore,Rr(-2 -4√2) + r^2*(12 + 8√2) = 0Factor out r:r[ R(-2 -4√2) + r(12 + 8√2) ] = 0Since r ≠ 0,R(-2 -4√2) + r(12 + 8√2) = 0Solve for R:R(-2 -4√2) = -r(12 + 8√2)Multiply both sides by -1:R(2 +4√2) = r(12 + 8√2)Thus,R = r(12 + 8√2)/(2 +4√2)Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: 12 +8√2 = 4*(3 + 2√2)Denominator: 2 +4√2 = 2*(1 + 2√2)So,R = [4*(3 + 2√2) r] / [2*(1 + 2√2)] = [2*(3 + 2√2) r]/(1 + 2√2)Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 - 2√2):R = [2*(3 + 2√2)(1 - 2√2) r] / [(1 + 2√2)(1 - 2√2)]Denominator:1 - (2√2)^2 = 1 - 8 = -7Numerator:2*(3 + 2√2)(1 - 2√2)First compute (3 + 2√2)(1 - 2√2):= 3*1 - 3*2√2 + 2√2*1 - 2√2*2√2= 3 -6√2 + 2√2 - 4*(√2)^2= 3 -4√2 -8= -5 -4√2Multiply by 2:= -10 -8√2Thus,R = (-10 -8√2) r / (-7)Simplify negatives:R = (10 +8√2)/7 * rTherefore,r/R = 7/(10 +8√2)Again, rationalize the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by (10 -8√2):r/R = 7*(10 -8√2) / [ (10 +8√2)(10 -8√2) ]Denominator:10^2 - (8√2)^2 = 100 - 64*2 = 100 -128 = -28Numerator:7*(10 -8√2) =70 -56√2Thus,r/R = (70 -56√2)/(-28) = - (70 -56√2)/28 = (-70 +56√2)/28Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 14:= (-5 +4√2)/2But this gives a negative value again? Wait, hold on. (-70 +56√2)/28 can be written as (-70/28) + (56√2)/28 = (-5/2) + 2√2.But 2√2 is approximately 2.828, and 5/2 is 2.5, so (-2.5 + 2.828) ≈ 0.328, which is positive. Wait, let me check:Wait, (-70 +56√2)/28. Let&#39;s compute 56√2 ≈56*1.414≈79.184. So -70 +79.184≈9.184. Then divide by 28≈0.328. So positive. But when we expressed it as (-5 +4√2)/2, that&#39;s (-5 +5.656)/2≈0.656/2≈0.328. So positive.But algebraically:(-70 +56√2)/28 = (-70)/28 + (56√2)/28 = -5/2 + 2√2 = (2√2 -5/2)Which is positive because 2√2 ≈2.828&gt;2.5=5/2. So 2.828 -2.5=0.328&gt;0. So actually, it&#39;s positive. Thus,r/R = ( -5 +4√2 ) / 2 = (4√2 -5)/2 ≈0.328/2≈0.164But let me write it as:r/R = (4√2 -5)/2Alternatively, factor out the numerator:= (4√2 -5)/2But let&#39;s check if this is correct. Let&#39;s verify with numbers.Suppose R=1, then r=(4√2 -5)/2≈(5.656-5)/2≈0.656/2≈0.328.Check if with R=1 and r≈0.328, whether the distances hold.First, center A (radius 2r≈0.656) is located at distance R -2r≈1 -0.656≈0.344 from O.Centers B and C (radius≈0.328) are located at distance R - r≈1 -0.328≈0.672 from O.Coordinates of B: (x, r≈0.328). x is computed as R -2r -2√2 r≈1 -0.656 -2*1.414*0.328≈1 -0.656 -0.928≈1 -1.584≈-0.584. So center B is at (-0.584, 0.328). Then distance from O to B: sqrt( (-0.584)^2 +0.328^2 )≈sqrt(0.341 +0.108)≈sqrt(0.449)≈0.67≈R -r≈0.672, which is close (approximation due to rounding).Distance from A to B: A is at (0.344, 0). B is at (-0.584, 0.328). The distance is sqrt( (0.344 +0.584)^2 + (0 -0.328)^2 )≈sqrt(0.928² +0.328²)≈sqrt(0.861 +0.108)=sqrt(0.969)=≈0.984. Which should be 3r≈0.984. 3*0.328≈0.984. So that checks out.Distance between B and C: Since they are at (x, r) and (x, -r), the distance is 2r≈0.656. Which matches.So even though algebraically it looked like a negative, due to the way we expanded, the actual value is positive. So the correct ratio is (4√2 -5)/2. But let&#39;s write it as (4√2 -5)/2.Alternatively, we can write it as:(4√2 -5)/2 = (4√2)/2 -5/2 = 2√2 -5/2. But I think the first form is better.Wait, but (4√2 -5)/2 is equivalent to (4√2 -5)/2. Let me check if this can be simplified further. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects it in another form.Wait, going back to R = (10 +8√2)/7 *r. So r/R =7/(10 +8√2). Then, when rationalizing, we have 7*(10 -8√2)/(-28) = (70 -56√2)/(-28) = (-70 +56√2)/28 = (56√2 -70)/28 = 14*(4√2 -5)/28 = (4√2 -5)/2. So yes, simplified, it&#39;s (4√2 -5)/2.But wait, that&#39;s approximately (5.656 -5)/2≈0.656/2≈0.328, which is the decimal we saw earlier. So (4√2 -5)/2 is the exact value. Alternatively, if we factor numerator and denominator differently, but that&#39;s probably the simplest form.But let me check if that&#39;s equivalent to 7/(10 +8√2). Let&#39;s compute 7/(10 +8√2). Multiply numerator and denominator by (10 -8√2):7*(10 -8√2)/(100 - (8√2)^2)=7*(10 -8√2)/(100 -128)=7*(10 -8√2)/(-28)= -(10 -8√2)/4= (-10 +8√2)/4= (8√2 -10)/4= (4√2 -5)/2. Yes, same result. So both forms are equivalent.Therefore, the ratio r/R is (4√2 -5)/2. Let me confirm with the problem statement once again. The three smaller circles are pairwise tangent and tangent to the large circle. Their radii are 2r, r, r. So the answer is (4√2 -5)/2. But maybe it&#39;s presented differently. Let me check.Alternatively, is there another approach using Descartes Circle Theorem?Descartes Circle Theorem relates the curvatures (reciprocals of radii) of four mutually tangent circles. The formula is:k4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2√(k1k2 +k2k3 +k3k1)Where ki = 1/ri.But in this case, the large circle is containing the three smaller circles, so its curvature would be negative (as it&#39;s externally tangent). Let&#39;s see.Let me recall Descartes&#39; Theorem:If four circles are mutually tangent, their curvatures k1, k2, k3, k4 satisfy:k4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2√(k1k2 + k2k3 +k3k1)Curvature is positive if the circle is externally tangent and negative if internally tangent. So in this case, the large circle is enclosing the three smaller circles, so its curvature would be negative. Let&#39;s denote:k1 = 1/(2r)k2 = 1/rk3 = 1/rk4 = -1/R (since the large circle is enclosing, curvature is negative)Applying Descartes&#39; Theorem:k4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2√(k1k2 +k2k3 +k3k1)So,-1/R = (1/(2r) + 1/r +1/r ) ± 2√( (1/(2r))(1/r) + (1/r)(1/r) + (1/r)(1/(2r)) )Simplify:Left side: -1/RRight side: (1/(2r) + 2/r) ± 2√[ (1/(2r^2)) + (1/r^2) + (1/(2r^2)) ]Compute the sum:1/(2r) + 2/r = (1 +4)/2r =5/(2r)Inside the sqrt:(1/(2r^2) +1/r^2 +1/(2r^2)) = (1 +2 +1)/2r^2 =4/(2r^2)=2/r^2Thus, sqrt(2/r^2)=√2 /rTherefore,-1/R =5/(2r) ± 2*(√2)/rMultiply both sides by r:- r/R =5/2 ± 2√2Therefore,r/R = -5/2 ∓ 2√2But since r/R is positive, we take the positive solution. Wait, but the left side is -r/R, so:- r/R =5/2 ± 2√2Thus,r/R = -5/2 ∓ 2√2But r/R must be positive, so we need:-5/2 -2√2 = negative, discardOr -5/2 +2√2. Wait, but that would be:-5/2 +2√2 ≈ -2.5 +2.828≈0.328, which is positive. So,r/R = -5/2 +2√2Which is equivalent to 2√2 -5/2= (4√2 -5)/2. Which matches our earlier result. So that&#39;s a more straightforward way using Descartes&#39; Theorem.Therefore, the answer is (4√2 -5)/2, which can also be written as 2√2 -5/2, but the first form is better.So, the ratio r/R is (4√2 -5)/2.Final AnswerThe ratio (frac{r}{R}) is boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{2} - 5}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that the radius of the large circle is ( R ), and the three smaller circles inside the large circle have radii ( 2r ), ( r ), and ( r ), we need to find the ratio (frac{r}{R}).Using Descartes&#39; Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (reciprocals of radii) of four mutually tangent circles, we denote the curvatures as follows:- ( k_1 = frac{1}{2r} ) for the circle with radius ( 2r ),- ( k_2 = frac{1}{r} ) for one of the circles with radius ( r ),- ( k_3 = frac{1}{r} ) for the other circle with radius ( r ),- ( k_4 = -frac{1}{R} ) for the large circle (negative because it is externally tangent).Descartes&#39; Circle Theorem states:[k_4 = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 pm 2sqrt{k_1k_2 + k_2k_3 + k_3k_1}]Substituting the curvatures:[-frac{1}{R} = frac{1}{2r} + frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{r} pm 2sqrt{left(frac{1}{2r} cdot frac{1}{r}right) + left(frac{1}{r} cdot frac{1}{r}right) + left(frac{1}{r} cdot frac{1}{2r}right)}]Simplifying the terms:[-frac{1}{R} = frac{1}{2r} + frac{2}{r} pm 2sqrt{frac{1}{2r^2} + frac{1}{r^2} + frac{1}{2r^2}}][-frac{1}{R} = frac{5}{2r} pm 2sqrt{frac{2}{r^2}}][-frac{1}{R} = frac{5}{2r} pm frac{2sqrt{2}}{r}]Multiplying both sides by ( r ):[-frac{r}{R} = frac{5}{2} pm 2sqrt{2}]Since (frac{r}{R}) must be positive, we choose the positive solution:[frac{r}{R} = -left(frac{5}{2} - 2sqrt{2}right)][frac{r}{R} = 2sqrt{2} - frac{5}{2}][frac{r}{R} = frac{4sqrt{2} - 5}{2}]Thus, the ratio (frac{r}{R}) is boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{2} - 5}{2}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the ratio of r over R, where R is the radius of the large circle, and the three smaller circles inside have radii 2r, r, and r. They are all pairwise tangent to each other and to the large circle. Hmm, let me visualize this. The large circle contains three smaller circles: two with radius r and one with radius 2r. Each of these smaller circles touches the large circle and also touches each other. First, maybe I should draw a diagram to get a better sense. The large circle has radius R. Inside it, there&#39;s a bigger small circle with radius 2r and two smaller ones with radius r. All three smaller circles are tangent to each other and to the large circle. So their centers must form a triangle, right? The centers of the three small circles. Since each pair of circles is tangent, the distance between their centers should equal the sum of their radii. Let me denote the centers of the three small circles as points A, B, and C. Let&#39;s say point A is the center of the circle with radius 2r, and points B and C are the centers of the two circles with radius r. Then, the distance between A and B should be 2r + r = 3r. Similarly, the distance between A and C should also be 3r. The distance between B and C should be r + r = 2r. So the triangle ABC has sides of length 3r, 3r, and 2r. That makes it an isosceles triangle. Now, all three centers A, B, C are located inside the large circle of radius R. Also, each of these centers is at a distance of R - (their radius) from the center of the large circle. Let me denote the center of the large circle as point O. Then, the distance from O to A is R - 2r, the distance from O to B is R - r, and the distance from O to C is also R - r. So, we have four points: O, A, B, C. Points A, B, C are inside the large circle, each at distances R - 2r, R - r, R - r from O. Also, the centers A, B, C form a triangle with sides 3r, 3r, 2r. Perhaps I can model this with coordinates. Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Let me try to place point A somewhere along the x-axis for simplicity. Let&#39;s say point A is at (d, 0), where d is the distance from O to A, which is R - 2r. Then points B and C must be located symmetrically with respect to the x-axis, each at a distance of R - r from O and at a distance of 3r from A and 2r from each other. Let me assign coordinates to points B and C. Let&#39;s suppose point B is at (x, y) and point C is at (x, -y) to maintain symmetry. Then, the distance from O to B is sqrt(x² + y²) = R - r. The distance from A to B is sqrt((x - d)² + y²) = 3r. The distance between B and C is 2y = 2r, since they are 2r apart. Wait, but the distance between B and C is supposed to be 2r. If their y-coordinates are y and -y, then the vertical distance is 2y, so 2y = 2r, which implies y = r. So, point B is at (x, r) and point C is at (x, -r). Now, let&#39;s use the distance from O to B: sqrt(x² + r²) = R - r. Therefore, x² + r² = (R - r)². Also, the distance from A to B is sqrt((x - d)² + r²) = 3r. So, (x - d)² + r² = (3r)² = 9r². We know that d = R - 2r, since point A is at (d, 0) and OA = R - 2r. So substituting d into the second equation:(x - (R - 2r))² + r² = 9r²Expanding that:(x - R + 2r)² + r² = 9r²Let&#39;s expand the square:(x - R + 2r)² = (x - R)² + 4r(x - R) + 4r²Wait, maybe better to do it step by step.Let me set t = x - (R - 2r), so t = x - R + 2r. Then, t² + r² = 9r² =&gt; t² = 8r² =&gt; t = sqrt(8)r or -sqrt(8)r. Therefore, x - R + 2r = ± 2√2 r. Therefore, x = R - 2r ± 2√2 r.But since the centers B and C are inside the large circle, x must be less than R - r (since the distance from O to B is R - r). Wait, but x is the x-coordinate of B. The distance from O to B is sqrt(x² + r²) = R - r, so x² + r² = (R - r)^2. Therefore, x² = (R - r)^2 - r² = R² - 2Rr + r² - r² = R² - 2Rr. So x = sqrt(R² - 2Rr). But we also have x = R - 2r ± 2√2 r from the previous equation. Hmmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I need to connect these two expressions for x.Wait, let&#39;s recap:From the coordinates:1. x² + r² = (R - r)^2 =&gt; x² = R² - 2Rr + r² - r² = R² - 2Rr. So x = sqrt(R² - 2Rr). Since x is a coordinate, it can be positive or negative, but in our setup, point A is at (d, 0) where d = R - 2r, and points B and C are on the right side (since they need to be tangent to A). Therefore, x should be positive. So x = sqrt(R² - 2Rr).But from the other equation:x = R - 2r ± 2√2 r. Wait, but which sign? If we take the positive sign, x = R - 2r + 2√2 r. If we take the negative sign, x = R - 2r - 2√2 r. But since x must be positive (as all centers are inside the circle), let&#39;s check which one makes sense.If R is larger than 2r, then x = R - 2r - 2√2 r might be negative if R isn&#39;t sufficiently large, but x must be positive. So perhaps we take the positive sign. Wait, but let&#39;s see. If x = sqrt(R² - 2Rr) and also x = R - 2r + 2√2 r. Therefore, equate these two expressions:sqrt(R² - 2Rr) = R - 2r + 2√2 rHmm, this seems messy. Maybe square both sides?Left side squared: R² - 2RrRight side squared: [R - 2r + 2√2 r]^2 = [R + r(-2 + 2√2)]² = R² + 2R * r(-2 + 2√2) + r²(-2 + 2√2)^2Set equal:R² - 2Rr = R² + 2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r²(-2 + 2√2)^2Simplify:Subtract R² from both sides:-2Rr = 2Rr(-2 + 2√2) + r²(-2 + 2√2)^2Factor out r on the right side:-2Rr = r[2R(-2 + 2√2) + r(-2 + 2√2)^2]Divide both sides by r (assuming r ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t):-2R = 2R(-2 + 2√2) + r(-2 + 2√2)^2Now, let&#39;s solve for r:Move the term with R to the left:-2R - 2R(-2 + 2√2) = r(-2 + 2√2)^2Factor R on the left:R[-2 - 2(-2 + 2√2)] = r(-2 + 2√2)^2Compute the bracket:-2 - 2(-2 + 2√2) = -2 + 4 - 4√2 = 2 - 4√2So left side: R(2 - 4√2)Right side: r(-2 + 2√2)^2Compute (-2 + 2√2)^2:= (-2)^2 + 2*(-2)*(2√2) + (2√2)^2= 4 - 8√2 + 8= 12 - 8√2So:R(2 - 4√2) = r(12 - 8√2)Solve for r/R:r/R = (2 - 4√2)/(12 - 8√2)Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor numerator: 2(1 - 2√2)Denominator: 4(3 - 2√2)So:r/R = [2(1 - 2√2)]/[4(3 - 2√2)] = [1 - 2√2]/[2(3 - 2√2)]To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (3 + 2√2):[ (1 - 2√2)(3 + 2√2) ] / [2(3 - 2√2)(3 + 2√2) ]Compute denominator first:(3 - 2√2)(3 + 2√2) = 9 - (2√2)^2 = 9 - 8 = 1So denominator becomes 2*1 = 2Numerator:(1)(3) + 1(2√2) - 2√2(3) - 2√2(2√2)= 3 + 2√2 - 6√2 - 4*(2)= 3 - 4√2 - 8= -5 - 4√2So numerator is -5 - 4√2, denominator is 2Therefore, r/R = (-5 - 4√2)/2But this gives a negative value for r/R, which is impossible since radii are positive. Hmm, that can&#39;t be. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.Wait, where did I go wrong? Let me check the steps again.Starting from:-2R = 2R(-2 + 2√2) + r(-2 + 2√2)^2Then,-2R - 2R(-2 + 2√2) = r(-2 + 2√2)^2Factor R:R[ -2 - 2(-2 + 2√2) ] = r(-2 + 2√2)^2Compute inside the brackets:-2 -2*(-2) -2*(2√2) = -2 +4 -4√2 = 2 -4√2So left side: R(2 -4√2)Right side: r*(12 -8√2)Therefore,R(2 -4√2) = r(12 -8√2)Thus,r/R = (2 -4√2)/(12 -8√2) = [2(1 -2√2)]/[4(3 -2√2)] = [1 -2√2]/[2(3 -2√2)]Then multiply numerator and denominator by (3 +2√2):[ (1 -2√2)(3 +2√2) ] / [2*(9 - (2√2)^2) ]Wait, denominator is 2*(9 - 8) = 2*1 = 2Numerator:1*3 +1*2√2 -2√2*3 -2√2*2√2=3 +2√2 -6√2 -4*2=3 -4√2 -8= -5 -4√2Therefore, r/R = (-5 -4√2)/2. Which is negative. Hmm. But this can&#39;t be. So where is the error?Wait, maybe when we squared the equation, we introduced an extraneous solution. Because when we squared both sides, sqrt(R² - 2Rr) = R -2r +2√2 r, but the left side is positive, and the right side must also be positive. Let&#39;s check the right side:R -2r +2√2 r = R + r(-2 +2√2). Since √2 is approximately 1.414, so 2√2 is about 2.828. So -2 +2.828 ≈ 0.828. So the term is R +0.828 r. Which is positive. But if we took the negative sign, x = R -2r -2√2 r, which would be R - r(2 +2√2), which may be negative if R isn&#39;t large enough. So perhaps we need to take the positive sign.But even with the positive sign, we ended up with a negative ratio. That&#39;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in setting up the equations.Let me re-examine the initial setup. Maybe my coordinate system is not correctly defined.I placed point A at (d, 0) where d = R -2r. Then points B and C are at (x, r) and (x, -r). Then the distance from O to B is sqrt(x² + r²) = R - r. The distance from A to B is sqrt( (x -d)^2 + (r -0)^2 ) = sqrt( (x -d)^2 + r² ) = 3r.So equations:1. x² + r² = (R - r)^22. (x - d)^2 + r² = (3r)^2And d = R -2r.Therefore, substituting d into equation 2:(x - (R -2r))² + r² = 9r²Expanding (x - R +2r)^2 + r² =9r²So (x - R +2r)^2 = 8r²Take square roots:x - R +2r = ±2√2 rTherefore:x = R -2r ±2√2 rSo x = R -2r +2√2 r or x = R -2r -2√2 rNow, since x must be positive (as centers B and C are inside the large circle), let&#39;s check both possibilities.First, x = R -2r +2√2 r. Since R &gt;2r (as the radius of the large circle must be bigger than twice the radius of the inner circle), so R -2r is positive. Adding 2√2 r makes it larger. So x is positive.Second, x = R -2r -2√2 r. If R is not large enough, this could be negative. But if R is large enough, it&#39;s positive. However, even if x is positive, let&#39;s see if it&#39;s feasible.But also, from equation 1: x² + r² = (R -r)^2So let&#39;s substitute x from the first case into equation 1.Case 1: x = R -2r +2√2 rCompute x² + r²:= [R -2r +2√2 r]^2 + r²= [R + r(-2 +2√2)]² + r²= R² + 2R*r(-2 +2√2) + r²*(-2 +2√2)^2 + r²= R² -4Rr +4√2 Rr + r²*(4 -8√2 +8) + r²Wait, compute (-2 +2√2)^2:= 4 - 8√2 + 8 = 12 -8√2So:= R² -4Rr +4√2 Rr + r²*(12 -8√2) + r²= R² -4Rr +4√2 Rr +12r² -8√2 r² +r²= R² + Rr(-4 +4√2) +13r² -8√2 r²But according to equation 1, x² + r² should equal (R -r)^2 = R² -2Rr +r²Therefore, equate:R² + Rr(-4 +4√2) +13r² -8√2 r² = R² -2Rr +r²Subtract R² from both sides:Rr(-4 +4√2) +13r² -8√2 r² = -2Rr +r²Bring all terms to left:Rr(-4 +4√2 +2) +13r² -8√2 r² -r² =0Simplify coefficients:For Rr: (-4 +4√2 +2) = (-2 +4√2)For r²: 13 -8√2 -1 =12 -8√2Thus:Rr(-2 +4√2) + r²(12 -8√2) =0Factor out r:r[ R(-2 +4√2) + r(12 -8√2) ] =0Since r ≠0,R(-2 +4√2) + r(12 -8√2) =0Solve for r/R:(-2 +4√2) + (r/R)(12 -8√2)=0Thus,(r/R)(12 -8√2)= 2 -4√2Therefore,r/R = (2 -4√2)/(12 -8√2)Which is the same as before. So this leads to the same negative ratio. So that&#39;s the problem. Therefore, Case 1 gives a negative ratio, which is impossible.Case 2: x = R -2r -2√2 rSubstitute into equation 1:x² + r² = [R -2r -2√2 r]^2 + r²= [R - r(2 +2√2)]² + r²= R² - 2Rr(2 +2√2) + r²(2 +2√2)^2 + r²Compute (2 +2√2)^2:=4 +8√2 +8=12 +8√2So:= R² -4Rr -4√2 Rr +r²(12 +8√2) +r²= R² -4Rr -4√2 Rr +13r² +8√2 r²Set equal to (R -r)^2 = R² -2Rr +r²:Thus,R² -4Rr -4√2 Rr +13r² +8√2 r² = R² -2Rr +r²Subtract R² from both sides:-4Rr -4√2 Rr +13r² +8√2 r² = -2Rr +r²Bring all terms to left:-4Rr -4√2 Rr +2Rr +13r² +8√2 r² -r² =0Simplify coefficients:For Rr: (-4 -4√2 +2) = (-2 -4√2)For r²:13 +8√2 -1 =12 +8√2Thus:Rr(-2 -4√2) + r²(12 +8√2)=0Factor out r:r[ R(-2 -4√2) + r(12 +8√2) ]=0Again, since r ≠0,R(-2 -4√2) + r(12 +8√2)=0Solve for r/R:(-2 -4√2) + (r/R)(12 +8√2)=0Thus,(r/R)(12 +8√2)=2 +4√2Therefore,r/R= (2 +4√2)/(12 +8√2)Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2(1 +2√2)Denominator:4(3 +2√2)Thus,r/R= [2(1 +2√2)]/[4(3 +2√2)] = [1 +2√2]/[2(3 +2√2)]Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by (3 -2√2):[ (1 +2√2)(3 -2√2) ] / [2*(3 +2√2)(3 -2√2) ]Denominator:(3)^2 - (2√2)^2 =9 -8=1, so denominator becomes 2*1=2Numerator:1*3 +1*(-2√2) +2√2*3 +2√2*(-2√2)=3 -2√2 +6√2 -4*2=3 +4√2 -8= -5 +4√2Therefore,r/R = (-5 +4√2)/2Compute this numerically to check if it&#39;s positive:√2 ≈1.414, so 4√2≈5.656So numerator: -5 +5.656≈0.656Therefore, 0.656/2≈0.328Which is positive. Therefore, r/R= (-5 +4√2)/2≈0.328, which is positive. So this is the valid solution.Therefore, the ratio r/R is (-5 +4√2)/2. Let&#39;s write it as (4√2 -5)/2.But let me check the algebra again to ensure no mistakes.After rationalizing:Numerator: (1 +2√2)(3 -2√2) =1*3 +1*(-2√2) +2√2*3 +2√2*(-2√2)=3 -2√2 +6√2 -4*(2)=3 +4√2 -8= -5 +4√2Yes, correct.Denominator:2*1=2So r/R=( -5 +4√2 )/2Which can be written as (4√2 -5)/2. Since 4√2 ≈5.656, 4√2 -5≈0.656, so this is positive. Therefore, this is the correct ratio.Therefore, the answer is (4√2 -5)/2. Let me check if this can be simplified or written differently.Alternatively, factor numerator:4√2 -5 =4√2 -5, which cannot be simplified further. So the ratio is (4√2 -5)/2.Alternatively, 4√2 -5 over 2. Let me check if this is the simplest form.Alternatively, factor out a common term? No, 4√2 and 5 are not like terms. So yes, that&#39;s the simplest form.Alternatively, write it as 2√2 -5/2. Since 4√2/2=2√2, and -5/2. So yes, 2√2 -5/2. But perhaps the first form is better.Therefore, the answer is (4√2 -5)/2, which is approximately 0.656/2≈0.328. So about 0.328, which seems reasonable.Let me verify with another approach to ensure correctness.Alternative approach: Using Descartes&#39; Circle Theorem.Descartes&#39; Circle Theorem relates the curvatures (reciprocals of radii) of four mutually tangent circles. The formula is:k4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2√(k1k2 +k2k3 +k3k1)Where k = 1/r.But in this case, the three small circles are inside the large circle and tangent to it. So the large circle has curvature k4 = -1/R (negative because it&#39;s enclosing the other circles). The three small circles have curvatures k1=1/(2r), k2=1/r, k3=1/r.Applying Descartes&#39; Theorem:k4 = k1 +k2 +k3 ±2√(k1k2 +k2k3 +k3k1)So:-1/R = (1/(2r) +1/r +1/r) ±2√[ (1/(2r))(1/r) + (1/r)(1/r) + (1/r)(1/(2r)) ]Simplify left side:-1/R = (1/(2r) +2/r) ±2√[ (1/(2r²) +1/r² +1/(2r²)) ]Compute the sum:1/(2r) +2/r =1/(2r) +4/(2r)=5/(2r)Inside the square root:1/(2r²) +1/r² +1/(2r²)= (1 +2 +1)/2r²=4/(2r²)=2/r²Therefore,-1/R =5/(2r) ±2√(2/r²)=5/(2r) ±2*(√2)/r=5/(2r) ± (2√2)/rMultiply both sides by r:- r/R =5/2 ±2√2But since r and R are positive, the left side is negative. Therefore, the right side must be negative. Thus, we take the negative sign:- r/R =5/2 -2√2Multiply both sides by -1:r/R= -5/2 +2√2=2√2 -5/2= (4√2 -5)/2Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the ratio is indeed (4√2 -5)/2.Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{2} -5}{2}}.Final AnswerThe ratio frac{r}{R} is boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{2} -5}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that the radius of the large circle is ( R ), and the three smaller circles inside the large circle are pairwise tangent to each other and to the large circle with radii ( 2r ), ( r ), and ( r ), we need to find the ratio ( frac{r}{R} ).First, we use Descartes&#39; Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures (reciprocals of radii) of four mutually tangent circles. The formula is:[k_4 = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 pm 2sqrt{k_1k_2 + k_2k_3 + k_3k_1}]where the curvatures ( k ) are defined as ( k = frac{1}{text{radius}} ). For the large circle (enclosing the other circles), the curvature is negative, so ( k_4 = -frac{1}{R} ). The curvatures of the three smaller circles are ( k_1 = frac{1}{2r} ), ( k_2 = frac{1}{r} ), and ( k_3 = frac{1}{r} ).Substituting these into Descartes&#39; Theorem:[-frac{1}{R} = frac{1}{2r} + frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{r} pm 2sqrt{left(frac{1}{2r} cdot frac{1}{r}right) + left(frac{1}{r} cdot frac{1}{r}right) + left(frac{1}{r} cdot frac{1}{2r}right)}]Simplifying the sum of curvatures:[frac{1}{2r} + frac{1}{r} + frac{1}{r} = frac{1}{2r} + frac{2}{r} = frac{1}{2r} + frac{4}{2r} = frac{5}{2r}]Simplifying the term inside the square root:[left(frac{1}{2r^2}right) + left(frac{1}{r^2}right) + left(frac{1}{2r^2}right) = frac{1 + 2 + 1}{2r^2} = frac{4}{2r^2} = frac{2}{r^2}]Substituting back into the equation:[-frac{1}{R} = frac{5}{2r} pm 2sqrt{frac{2}{r^2}} = frac{5}{2r} pm frac{2sqrt{2}}{r}]Since the left side is negative, we take the negative sign:[-frac{1}{R} = frac{5}{2r} - frac{2sqrt{2}}{r}]Multiplying both sides by ( r ):[-frac{r}{R} = frac{5}{2} - 2sqrt{2}]Multiplying both sides by -1:[frac{r}{R} = 2sqrt{2} - frac{5}{2}]Thus, the ratio ( frac{r}{R} ) is:[boxed{dfrac{4sqrt{2} - 5}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8b13bc3f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8b13bc3f><span class="icon" data-v-8b13bc3f>🔑:</span>12. frac{4 sqrt{2}-5}{2}.It is easy to prove that O and B lie on the common tangent of odot A and odot A^{prime}, so we only need to consider half of the figure.

So, we have a cube ABCD A₁B₁C₁D₁ with edge length a. We need to find two things: first, the distance from the midpoint P of edge BC to the line passing through vertex A and the center S of the face A₁B₁C₁D₁. Second, we need to find the area of the cross-section of the cube cut by the plane APS.Hmm, let&#39;s start by visualizing the cube. Let me sketch it mentally. The cube has vertices labeled in the standard way, with ABCD being the base face and A₁B₁C₁D₁ the top face. Each edge is length a. Point P is the midpoint of BC, so its coordinates would be halfway along BC. The line we&#39;re interested in goes from A to S, where S is the center of the top face. The center S would be the average of the coordinates of A₁, B₁, C₁, D₁. Wait, no, the face A₁B₁C₁D₁ is a square, so its center would be the point halfway between A₁ and C₁, or B₁ and D₁. So S is the center of that top face.First, let&#39;s assign coordinates to all the points to make it easier. Let&#39;s place the cube in a 3D coordinate system. Let me assume that point A is at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, since it&#39;s a cube with edge length a, the coordinates of the other points can be determined:- A: (0, 0, 0)- B: (a, 0, 0)- C: (a, a, 0)- D: (0, a, 0)- A₁: (0, 0, a)- B₁: (a, 0, a)- C₁: (a, a, a)- D₁: (0, a, a)So, midpoint P of BC: B is (a,0,0) and C is (a,a,0). The midpoint P would be ((a + a)/2, (0 + a)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (a, a/2, 0).Center S of the top face A₁B₁C₁D₁: The top face is a square with vertices at (0,0,a), (a,0,a), (a,a,a), (0,a,a). The center S would be the average of the coordinates of these four points. Alternatively, since it&#39;s the center, it&#39;s halfway between A₁ and C₁, which are (0,0,a) and (a,a,a). So midpoint S would be ((0 + a)/2, (0 + a)/2, (a + a)/2) = (a/2, a/2, a).So the line we&#39;re interested in is the line passing through A (0,0,0) and S (a/2, a/2, a). We need to find the distance from point P (a, a/2, 0) to this line.To find the distance from a point to a line in 3D, the formula is:Distance = |(Q - P₀) × v| / |v|Where Q is the point, P₀ is a point on the line, and v is the direction vector of the line.So here, Q is P (a, a/2, 0), P₀ is A (0,0,0), and the direction vector v of line AS is S - A = (a/2, a/2, a).First, let&#39;s compute Q - P₀, which is P - A = (a, a/2, 0) - (0,0,0) = (a, a/2, 0).Then, compute the cross product of (Q - P₀) and v.Cross product (a, a/2, 0) × (a/2, a/2, a):Using the formula:i component: (a/2 * a) - (0 * a/2) = (a²/2 - 0) = a²/2j component: - [(a * a) - (0 * a/2)] = - (a² - 0) = -a²k component: (a * a/2) - (a/2 * a/2) = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4So the cross product is (a²/2, -a², a²/4)The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt[(a²/2)^2 + (-a²)^2 + (a²/4)^2]Let&#39;s compute each term:(a²/2)^2 = a^4 /4(-a²)^2 = a^4(a²/4)^2 = a^4 /16Adding them up: a^4/4 + a^4 + a^4/16 = (4a^4 + 16a^4 + a^4)/16 = (21a^4)/16So the magnitude is sqrt(21a^4/16) = (a²/4)sqrt(21)Then, the magnitude of the direction vector v is |v| = sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + a^2] = sqrt[(a²/4 + a²/4 + a²)] = sqrt[(a²/2 + a²)] = sqrt(3a²/2) = (a)sqrt(3/2) = (a/√2)sqrt(3) = (a√6)/2Wait, let me check that again:v is (a/2, a/2, a)So |v| = sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + a^2 )= sqrt( a²/4 + a²/4 + a² )= sqrt( a²/2 + a² )= sqrt( 3a²/2 )= a * sqrt(3/2 )= a * (√6)/2Yes, so |v| = (a√6)/2So the distance is [ (a²/4)sqrt(21) ] / [ (a√6)/2 ] = [ (a² sqrt(21))/4 ] * [ 2/(a√6) ] = [ (a² * 2 * sqrt(21)) / (4 * a * sqrt(6)) ) ] = [ (a sqrt(21)) / (2 sqrt(6)) ) ]Simplify sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(21/6) = sqrt(7/2) = √14 / 2? Wait:Wait, sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(21/6) = sqrt(7/2). Hmm, but let&#39;s rationalize:sqrt(7/2) = (√14)/2So then the distance is (a * √14)/ (2 * 2 ) = a√14 /4 ?Wait, let me check again:Wait, the numerator after substitution is (a² sqrt(21))/4 multiplied by 2/(a√6). So:(a² * 2 * sqrt(21)) / (4 * a * sqrt(6)) ) = (2a sqrt(21)) / (4 sqrt(6)) ) = (a sqrt(21)) / (2 sqrt(6)) )Then, sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(21/6) = sqrt(7/2) = √(7)/√2 = (√14)/2Therefore, (a * √14 / 2 ) / 2 = a√14 /4Yes, so the distance is (a√14)/4. So that&#39;s the first part.Now, the second part is the area of the cross-section of the cube by the plane APS. So the cross-section is a polygon formed by the intersection of the plane with the cube. The plane passes through points A, P, and S.Let me first confirm the coordinates:- A is (0,0,0)- P is (a, a/2, 0)- S is (a/2, a/2, a)So these three points are non-collinear, so they define a unique plane. To find the cross-section, we need to find all the edges of the cube that intersect this plane, then the cross-section will be the polygon formed by these intersection points.Alternatively, since the plane passes through three points of the cube, the cross-section will be a triangle or a quadrilateral or another polygon. But since it&#39;s a cube, and the plane passes through three non-collinear points, the cross-section is a triangle if the plane doesn&#39;t intersect any other edges, but likely it&#39;s a quadrilateral or a pentagon depending on how the plane cuts through the cube.Wait, but perhaps it&#39;s a triangle if the three points are vertices of the cube, but in this case, A is a vertex, P is a midpoint, and S is a center of a face. So the cross-section will pass through A, P, S, and possibly other points where the plane intersects edges of the cube.To find the cross-section, we need to find all intersection points between the plane APS and the edges of the cube. Let&#39;s find the equations for the plane first.Given three points A(0,0,0), P(a, a/2, 0), S(a/2, a/2, a). Let&#39;s find the equation of the plane.First, find two vectors in the plane:AP = P - A = (a, a/2, 0)AS = S - A = (a/2, a/2, a)Then, the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of AP and AS.Compute AP × AS:AP = (a, a/2, 0)AS = (a/2, a/2, a)Cross product:i component: (a/2 * a) - (0 * a/2) = a²/2 - 0 = a²/2j component: - [ (a * a) - (0 * a/2) ] = - [a² - 0] = -a²k component: (a * a/2) - (a/2 * a/2) = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4So the normal vector is (a²/2, -a², a²/4). We can divide by a² to simplify: (1/2, -1, 1/4). But maybe we can multiply by 4 to eliminate denominators: (2, -4, 1). So the normal vector is proportional to (2, -4, 1).So the equation of the plane can be written as 2(x - 0) - 4(y - 0) + 1(z - 0) = 0, which simplifies to 2x -4y + z = 0.Alternatively, scaling the normal vector (a²/2, -a², a²/4) gives the equation:(a²/2)(x) + (-a²)(y) + (a²/4)(z) = dBut since the plane passes through A(0,0,0), substituting gives d = 0. So the equation is:(a²/2)x - a² y + (a²/4) z = 0We can divide through by a² to simplify:(1/2)x - y + (1/4)z = 0Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fractions:2x - 4y + z = 0Yes, that&#39;s simpler. So the plane equation is 2x -4y + z = 0.Now, we need to find all edges of the cube that intersect this plane. Each edge of the cube is along one of the coordinate axes, so we can check for intersection with each edge.The cube has 12 edges. Let&#39;s list them:1. AB: from A(0,0,0) to B(a,0,0)2. BC: from B(a,0,0) to C(a,a,0)3. CD: from C(a,a,0) to D(0,a,0)4. DA: from D(0,a,0) to A(0,0,0)5. A A₁: from A(0,0,0) to A₁(0,0,a)6. B B₁: from B(a,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a)7. C C₁: from C(a,a,0) to C₁(a,a,a)8. D D₁: from D(0,a,0) to D₁(0,a,a)9. A₁B₁: from A₁(0,0,a) to B₁(a,0,a)10. B₁C₁: from B₁(a,0,a) to C₁(a,a,a)11. C₁D₁: from C₁(a,a,a) to D₁(0,a,a)12. D₁A₁: from D₁(0,a,a) to A₁(0,0,a)Now, the plane passes through points A, P, S. So we already know that edge BC is intersected at P, edge A A₁ is at A, and the top face edge from S. But S is the center of the top face, so it&#39;s not on an edge but in the center.Wait, but the plane equation is 2x -4y + z = 0. Let&#39;s check for each edge whether it intersects the plane.But maybe we can find the intersection points by parametrizing each edge and solving for the parameter where the plane equation is satisfied.Alternatively, since the cross-section is formed by the plane cutting through the cube, and since the plane passes through three points: A, P, and S, which are in different parts of the cube, the cross-section is likely a triangle or a quadrilateral. Wait, but A is a vertex, P is on edge BC (base face), and S is in the center of the top face. So the plane will cut through other edges as well.Let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, check edge AB: from A(0,0,0) to B(a,0,0). Since A is on the plane, so edge AB intersects the plane at A.Edge BC: from B(a,0,0) to C(a,a,0). Midpoint P is on the plane, so edge BC intersects the plane at P.Edge CD: from C(a,a,0) to D(0,a,0). Let&#39;s parametrize this edge as (a - t, a, 0) where t goes from 0 to a. Plug into plane equation: 2x -4y + z = 0. So 2(a - t) -4(a) + 0 = 0 → 2a - 2t -4a = 0 → -2a -2t = 0 → t = -a. Which is outside the parameter range (0 ≤ t ≤ a). So no intersection here.Edge DA: from D(0,a,0) to A(0,0,0). D is (0,a,0). Plug into plane equation: 2*0 -4*a +0 = -4a ≠ 0. So parametrize as (0, a - t, 0), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2*0 -4*(a - t) +0 = -4a +4t = 0 → t = a. Which is point A. So DA intersects the plane at A.Edge A A₁: from A(0,0,0) to A₁(0,0,a). A is on the plane, so intersection at A.Edge B B₁: from B(a,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a). Let&#39;s parametrize as (a,0, t), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2*a -4*0 + t = 2a + t = 0 → t = -2a. Not in range. So no intersection.Edge C C₁: from C(a,a,0) to C₁(a,a,a). Parametrize as (a, a, t). Plane equation: 2a -4a + t = -2a + t = 0 → t = 2a. Not in range. No intersection.Edge D D₁: from D(0,a,0) to D₁(0,a,a). Parametrize as (0, a, t). Plane equation: 0 -4a + t = -4a + t = 0 → t =4a. Not in range. No intersection.Edge A₁B₁: from A₁(0,0,a) to B₁(a,0,a). Parametrize as (t,0,a), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2t -4*0 + a = 2t + a =0 → t = -a/2. Not in range.Edge B₁C₁: from B₁(a,0,a) to C₁(a,a,a). Parametrize as (a, t, a), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2a -4t + a = 3a -4t =0 → t= 3a/4. Which is within [0,a]. So intersection at (a, 3a/4, a).Edge C₁D₁: from C₁(a,a,a) to D₁(0,a,a). Parametrize as (a - t, a, a), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2(a -t) -4a +a = 2a -2t -4a +a = (-a -2t) =0 → t = -a/2. Not in range.Edge D₁A₁: from D₁(0,a,a) to A₁(0,0,a). Parametrize as (0, a - t, a), t from 0 to a. Plane equation: 0 -4(a - t) +a = -4a +4t +a = -3a +4t=0 → t=3a/4. So intersection at (0, a -3a/4, a) = (0, a/4, a).Edge A A₁: already considered, intersects at A.So, summarizing the intersections:- Edge AB: point A- Edge BC: point P- Edge DA: point A- Edge A A₁: point A- Edge B₁C₁: point (a, 3a/4, a)- Edge D₁A₁: point (0, a/4, a)So the cross-section polygon is formed by connecting these points. However, note that point A is shared by multiple edges, but since the plane passes through A, P, and S, and also intersects edges B₁C₁ and D₁A₁ at (a, 3a/4, a) and (0, a/4, a) respectively, and S is the center of the top face. Wait, but S is (a/2, a/2, a). Is S on the plane?Yes, because substituting into 2x -4y + z: 2*(a/2) -4*(a/2) + a = a -2a +a =0. So S is on the plane. So the cross-section passes through S as well.But S is not on an edge, it&#39;s the center of the top face. So how does that fit in?Wait, the cross-section is formed by the intersection of the plane with the cube. The plane passes through A, P, and S. But S is inside the top face, not on an edge. So the cross-section polygon will have vertices at A, P, the intersection points on B₁C₁ and D₁A₁, and S?Wait, perhaps not. Let me re-examine.The plane intersects the cube along the edges and through the faces. Since S is the center of the top face, but not on an edge, the plane must pass through the interior of the top face at S. Therefore, the cross-section polygon will consist of the following points:- A (0,0,0)- P (a, a/2, 0)- Intersection on B₁C₁: (a, 3a/4, a)- S (a/2, a/2, a)- Intersection on D₁A₁: (0, a/4, a)- Back to A? Wait, but how?Wait, the cross-section is a polygon. Let&#39;s list all the intersection points:1. A (0,0,0)2. P (a, a/2, 0)3. Intersection on B₁C₁: (a, 3a/4, a)4. S (a/2, a/2, a) [Wait, S is in the plane, but does the plane pass through S via an edge? S is the center of the top face, so it&#39;s not on an edge. Therefore, the plane passes through S by cutting through the interior of the top face. So the cross-section polygon would need to connect from (a, 3a/4, a) to S and then to (0, a/4, a). But how does the plane intersect the cube between those points?Alternatively, maybe S is a vertex of the cross-section. Since S is on the plane and inside the top face, the cross-section polygon will pass through S. Therefore, the cross-section polygon is a pentagon with vertices:A, P, (a, 3a/4, a), S, (0, a/4, a), and back to A? Wait, but does the plane intersect another edge between (0, a/4, a) and A?Wait, when moving from (0, a/4, a) to A, we are going along the edge D₁A₁ to A₁? No, A is (0,0,0), so from (0, a/4, a) down to A, that&#39;s not an edge. So perhaps the cross-section is a pentagon: A, P, intersection on B₁C₁, S, intersection on D₁A₁, and back to A. However, to close the polygon, we need to connect (0, a/4, a) back to A. But that would pass through the interior of the cube, not along an edge. Wait, no. The cross-section is formed by the intersection of the plane with the cube&#39;s faces. So the cross-section polygon is made up of line segments where the plane cuts through each face.Given that the plane cuts through the cube, intersecting some of its edges and passing through some faces. Let&#39;s think about each face:1. Base face ABCD: The plane intersects this face along the line from A to P, which is edge AB (at A) and edge BC (at P).2. Front face AB B₁A₁: Does the plane intersect this face? The plane passes through A and goes upwards. But we already have intersections on other edges.Wait, perhaps better to consider all six faces:1. Base face ABCD: intersects at A and P.2. Top face A₁B₁C₁D₁: intersects at S and the two intersection points on edges B₁C₁ and D₁A₁.3. Front face AB B₁A₁: Does the plane intersect this face? The front face is x from 0 to a, y=0, z from 0 to a. The plane equation is 2x -4y + z =0. On y=0, the equation becomes 2x + z =0. But on the front face, y=0 and x and z are between 0 and a. So 2x + z =0 would require z = -2x. But z ≥0 and x ≥0, so only solution is x=0, z=0, which is point A. So only intersection at A.4. Back face CD D₁C₁: y=a, x from 0 to a, z from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2x -4a + z =0 → z=4a -2x. For z between 0 and a: 4a -2x ≥0 → x ≤2a, which is always true since x ≤a. And 4a -2x ≤a → 4a -a ≤2x → 3a ≤2x → x ≥ 3a/2. But x ≤a, which is less than 3a/2. So no solution. Therefore, the plane doesn&#39;t intersect the back face except at point P which is on the base face.5. Left face AD D₁A₁: x=0, y from 0 to a, z from 0 to a. Plane equation: 0 -4y + z =0 → z=4y. For z between 0 and a: 4y ≤a → y ≤a/4. So on x=0, the intersection is from y=0 to y=a/4, z=4y. This is the line from A(0,0,0) to (0, a/4, a). Wait, but (0, a/4, a) is the intersection point on edge D₁A₁. So the plane intersects the left face along the line segment from A to (0, a/4, a).6. Right face BC C₁B₁: x=a, y from 0 to a, z from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2a -4y + z =0 → z=4y -2a. For z between 0 and a: 4y -2a ≥0 → y ≥a/2, and 4y -2a ≤a → 4y ≤3a → y ≤3a/4. So y between a/2 and 3a/4. Therefore, the intersection on the right face is the line segment from (a, a/2, 0) [which is point P] to (a, 3a/4, a) [the intersection on edge B₁C₁].7. There&#39;s also the rear face, but we checked back face already.So putting this all together, the cross-section polygon is formed by the following line segments:- From A(0,0,0) to P(a, a/2, 0) on the base face.- From P(a, a/2, 0) up along the right face to (a, 3a/4, a).- From (a, 3a/4, a) to S(a/2, a/2, a) on the top face.- From S(a/2, a/2, a) down along the left face to (0, a/4, a).- From (0, a/4, a) back down to A(0,0,0) along the left face.Wait, but how does it go from (0, a/4, a) to A? On the left face, the plane intersects from A to (0, a/4, a). So the cross-section should have vertices:A, P, (a, 3a/4, a), S, (0, a/4, a), and back to A. So it&#39;s a pentagon.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm:The cross-section is the intersection of the plane with the cube. The plane cuts through the base face at AP, the right face from P to (a, 3a/4, a), the top face from (a, 3a/4, a) to S, then from S to (0, a/4, a) on the left face, and then down from (0, a/4, a) to A. So yes, a pentagon with five vertices.But wait, S is the center of the top face, so it&#39;s not on an edge. So the plane passes through S, which is inside the top face. Therefore, the intersection with the top face is the line from (a, 3a/4, a) to S to (0, a/4, a). But the top face is a square, so the line from (a, 3a/4, a) to S to (0, a/4, a) is part of the cross-section.But to compute the area of this pentagonal cross-section, we can divide it into triangles or trapezoids, or use coordinates to compute the area via vectors.Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of all five vertices, we can use the shoelace formula in 3D. However, since the polygon is planar, we can project it onto a 2D plane and compute the area there.Let me list the coordinates of the five vertices:1. A: (0, 0, 0)2. P: (a, a/2, 0)3. Q: (a, 3a/4, a)4. S: (a/2, a/2, a)5. R: (0, a/4, a)We need to compute the area of the pentagon A-P-Q-S-R-A.Since all these points lie on the plane 2x -4y + z =0, we can parameterize the plane or choose a coordinate system on the plane to compute the area.Alternatively, use vectors and the cross product to compute the area.Alternatively, divide the pentagon into triangles and sum their areas.Let me try the triangle method.Divide the pentagon into three triangles: A-P-Q, A-Q-S, A-S-R. Wait, but that might not cover the entire area correctly. Alternatively, divide into three triangles: A-P-Q, Q-S-R, and A-R-Q? Not sure. Alternatively, use the shoelace formula in 3D by projecting onto a 2D plane.First, let&#39;s find a coordinate system on the plane.The plane has normal vector (2, -4, 1). To project onto 2D, we can choose two orthogonal vectors on the plane.Alternatively, use the area formula for a polygon in 3D space:Area = (1/2) | Σ (Vi × Vi+1) |, where Vi are the vertices in order.But I need to confirm this formula.Alternatively, use the following method: The area of a planar polygon in 3D can be calculated by projecting onto a coordinate plane orthogonal to the polygon&#39;s normal. The area is then the magnitude of the projected area divided by the cosine of the angle between the polygon&#39;s normal and the coordinate plane&#39;s normal.But this might be complicated.Alternatively, use the formula:Area = (1/2) | (AB × AC) + (AC × AD) + ... | for a polygon, but I think this works for triangles.Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the following approach:Since all points lie on the plane 2x -4y + z =0, we can express z = -2x +4y. Then, we can parameterize the points in 2D by ignoring one coordinate, but we need to adjust for the scaling due to the plane&#39;s orientation.Alternatively, choose two vectors on the plane, say AP and AS, compute the area of the polygon relative to those vectors.But this might get too involved. Alternatively, use the general formula for the area of a polygon in 3D:The area can be computed as half the magnitude of the sum over the edges of the cross product of consecutive vertices.Wait, I think the formula is:Area = (1/2) * || Σ (Vi × Vi+1) || where Vi are vectors from the origin.But this might not be correct. Let me think.Alternatively, if the polygon is defined by vertices V1, V2, ..., Vn, then the area can be computed by projecting onto a coordinate plane. For example, project onto the y-z plane, compute the area there, and then adjust by the angle between the polygon&#39;s normal and the y-z plane&#39;s normal.The area in 3D is equal to the area of the projection divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane&#39;s normal and the projection direction.Let me recall that formula: If we project a planar polygon onto a plane with normal vector n_proj, then the area of the projection is equal to the area of the original polygon times |cos θ|, where θ is the angle between the original plane&#39;s normal and n_proj.Therefore, if we compute the area of the projection onto, say, the y-z plane, and then divide by |cos θ|, we get the original area.First, compute the normal vector of the plane. We already have it as (2, -4, 1). Let&#39;s compute the unit normal vector:|n| = sqrt(2² + (-4)² +1²) = sqrt(4 +16 +1) = sqrt(21). So unit normal is (2, -4,1)/sqrt(21).The angle θ between this normal and the y-z plane&#39;s normal (which is the x-axis direction (1,0,0)).The cosine of the angle is the dot product of the two normals:cos θ = (2/sqrt(21)) *1 + (-4/sqrt(21))*0 + (1/sqrt(21))*0 = 2/sqrt(21).Therefore, the area of the projection onto the y-z plane is equal to the original area times |cos θ|. Therefore, Original Area = Projected Area / |cos θ| = Projected Area / (2/sqrt(21)) = (Projected Area) * sqrt(21)/2.So if we can compute the projected area onto the y-z plane, multiply by sqrt(21)/2 to get the original area.Alternatively, project onto another plane. Let&#39;s choose the projection onto the y-z plane.The vertices projected onto the y-z plane (i.e., ignoring the x-coordinate) are:1. A: (0,0) → (y=0, z=0)2. P: (a/2,0) → (y=a/2, z=0)3. Q: (3a/4, a)4. S: (a/2, a)5. R: (a/4, a)Wait, no. When projecting onto the y-z plane, we set x=0, so each point (x,y,z) becomes (y,z). But actually, projection onto y-z would keep y and z coordinates. But since the original polygon is in 3D, projecting onto y-z would map each point (x,y,z) to (y,z). Let&#39;s list the projected points:1. A: (0,0,0) → (0,0)2. P: (a, a/2,0) → (a/2,0)3. Q: (a, 3a/4, a) → (3a/4, a)4. S: (a/2, a/2, a) → (a/2, a)5. R: (0, a/4, a) → (a/4, a)So the projected polygon has vertices at:(0,0), (a/2,0), (3a/4,a), (a/2,a), (a/4,a), back to (0,0).Now, compute the area of this projected polygon using the shoelace formula.Shoelace formula for 2D polygon:Area = 1/2 |Σ (y_i * z_{i+1} - y_{i+1} * z_i)|Wait, but here the coordinates are (y,z). Let&#39;s denote them as (u,v):Vertices in order:1. (0,0)2. (a/2,0)3. (3a/4,a)4. (a/2,a)5. (a/4,a)6. (0,0)Compute shoelace sum:Sum1 = (0*0 + (a/2)*a + (3a/4)*a + (a/2)*a + (a/4)*0) Wait, no. Let&#39;s list them as pairs:Vertex 1: (u1, v1) = (0,0)Vertex 2: (u2, v2) = (a/2,0)Vertex 3: (u3, v3) = (3a/4, a)Vertex 4: (u4, v4) = (a/2, a)Vertex 5: (u5, v5) = (a/4, a)Vertex 6: (u6, v6) = (0,0)Shoelace formula:Sum over i=1 to 5 of (u_i * v_{i+1} - u_{i+1} * v_i)So:Term1: u1*v2 - u2*v1 = 0*0 - (a/2)*0 =0Term2: u2*v3 - u3*v2 = (a/2)*a - (3a/4)*0 = a²/2Term3: u3*v4 - u4*v3 = (3a/4)*a - (a/2)*a = (3a²/4) - (a²/2) = (3a²/4 - 2a²/4) = a²/4Term4: u4*v5 - u5*v4 = (a/2)*a - (a/4)*a = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4Term5: u5*v6 - u6*v5 = (a/4)*0 - 0*a =0Sum of terms: 0 + a²/2 + a²/4 +a²/4 +0 = a²/2 + a²/2 = a²Absolute value: |a²| =a²Area = 1/2 * a² = a²/2But this is the area of the projected polygon. Then, the original area is (a²/2) * (sqrt(21)/2) = (a² sqrt(21))/4.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm:The projected area is a²/2. The angle between the original plane&#39;s normal and the y-z plane&#39;s normal (x-axis) is θ, with cos θ = 2/sqrt(21). Therefore, the original area is (projected area)/cos θ = (a²/2)/(2/sqrt(21)) )= (a²/2)*(sqrt(21)/2) = (a² sqrt(21))/4.Yes, so the area of the cross-section is (a² sqrt(21))/4.But wait, let me cross-validate this with another method.Alternatively, divide the pentagon into three triangles:1. Triangle A-P-Q2. Triangle Q-S-R3. Triangle R-A-SWait, but this might not cover the entire area. Alternatively, divide into triangles:A-P-Q-S-R-A as a polygon. Let&#39;s divide it into three triangles: A-P-Q, A-Q-S, A-S-R.But let me compute the area of each triangle using vectors.First, triangle A-P-Q:Points A(0,0,0), P(a, a/2, 0), Q(a, 3a/4, a).Vectors AP = (a, a/2, 0), AQ = (a, 3a/4, a).The area is (1/2)|AP × AQ|.Compute AP × AQ:AP = (a, a/2, 0)AQ = (a, 3a/4, a)Cross product:i: (a/2 * a - 0 * 3a/4) = a²/2j: - (a * a - 0 * a) = -a²k: (a * 3a/4 - a/2 * a) = (3a²/4 - a²/2) = (3a²/4 - 2a²/4) = a²/4So cross product vector: (a²/2, -a², a²/4)Magnitude: sqrt( (a²/2)^2 + (-a²)^2 + (a²/4)^2 ) = sqrt( a^4/4 + a^4 + a^4/16 ) = sqrt( (4a^4 + 16a^4 + a^4)/16 ) = sqrt(21a^4/16) = (a²/4)sqrt(21)Area of triangle A-P-Q: (1/2)*(a²/4)sqrt(21) = (a²/8)sqrt(21)Second, triangle A-Q-S:Points A(0,0,0), Q(a, 3a/4, a), S(a/2, a/2, a)Vectors AQ = (a, 3a/4, a), AS = (a/2, a/2, a)Cross product AQ × AS:AQ = (a, 3a/4, a)AS = (a/2, a/2, a)i: (3a/4 * a - a * a/2) = (3a²/4 - a²/2) = (3a²/4 - 2a²/4) = a²/4j: - (a * a - a * a/2) = - (a² - a²/2) = -a²/2k: (a * a/2 - 3a/4 * a/2) = (a²/2 - 3a²/8) = (4a²/8 -3a²/8) = a²/8Cross product vector: (a²/4, -a²/2, a²/8)Magnitude: sqrt( (a²/4)^2 + (-a²/2)^2 + (a²/8)^2 ) = sqrt( a^4/16 + a^4/4 + a^4/64 ) = sqrt(4a^4/64 + 16a^4/64 + a^4/64 ) = sqrt(21a^4/64 ) = (a²/8)sqrt(21)Area of triangle A-Q-S: (1/2)*(a²/8)sqrt(21) = (a²/16)sqrt(21)Third, triangle A-S-R:Points A(0,0,0), S(a/2, a/2, a), R(0, a/4, a)Vectors AS = (a/2, a/2, a), AR = (0, a/4, a)Cross product AS × AR:AS = (a/2, a/2, a)AR = (0, a/4, a)i: (a/2 * a - a * a/4) = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4j: - (a/2 * a - a * 0) = - (a²/2 - 0) = -a²/2k: (a/2 * a/4 - a/2 * 0) = a²/8 -0 = a²/8Cross product vector: (a²/4, -a²/2, a²/8)Same as previous cross product.Magnitude: same as before, (a²/8)sqrt(21)Area: (1/2)*(a²/8)sqrt(21) = (a²/16)sqrt(21)Fourth, triangle R-A-A: Wait, maybe I missed a triangle. The pentagon A-P-Q-S-R-A can be divided into three triangles: A-P-Q, A-Q-S, A-S-R, but that only covers three parts. However, the total area would be:(a²/8 + a²/16 + a²/16 ) sqrt(21) = ( (2a² + a² + a²)/16 ) sqrt(21) = (4a²/16) sqrt(21) = (a²/4) sqrt(21)Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the total area is (a² sqrt(21))/4.So, the answers are:Distance from P to line AS: (a√14)/4Area of cross-section: (a²√21)/4But let me check units and dimensions. Distance should be in units of a, area in a². Both expressions are dimensionally correct.Therefore, the final answers are:Distance: (a√14)/4Area: (a²√21)/4Final AnswerUdaljenost je boxed{dfrac{asqrt{14}}{4}}, a površina presjeka boxed{dfrac{a^2sqrt{21}}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a cube (ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1) with edge length (a), we need to determine the distance from the midpoint (P) of edge (overline{BC}) to the line passing through vertex (A) and the center (S) of the face (A_1B_1C_1D_1), and the area of the cross-section of the cube cut by the plane (APS).

So, we have a cube named ABCD A₁B₁C₁D₁ with edge length a. The first part asks for the distance from the midpoint P of edge BC to the line passing through vertex A and the center S of the face A₁B₁C₁D₁. The second part asks for the area of the cross-section of the cube cut by the plane APS. First, let me visualize the cube. Let me assign coordinates to each vertex to make it easier. Let&#39;s place vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since it&#39;s a cube, all edges are length a. So, moving along the x-axis from A, we have B at (a,0,0). From B, moving along the y-axis (since it&#39;s a cube, the next edge would be along the y-axis?), wait, actually, in standard cube labeling, ABCD is the base face, and A₁B₁C₁D₁ is the top face. So, moving from A to B is along the x-axis, from B to C is along the y-axis, and from A to A₁ is along the z-axis. Wait, that might not be standard, but let&#39;s fix a coordinate system to avoid confusion.Let me set up the coordinates as follows:- A = (0, 0, 0)- B = (a, 0, 0)- C = (a, a, 0)- D = (0, a, 0)- A₁ = (0, 0, a)- B₁ = (a, 0, a)- C₁ = (a, a, a)- D₁ = (0, a, a)So, the base face ABCD is in the z=0 plane, and the top face A₁B₁C₁D₁ is in the z=a plane.Now, midpoint P of edge BC. Edge BC goes from B (a,0,0) to C (a,a,0). The midpoint P would be ((a + a)/2, (0 + a)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (a, a/2, 0).Next, the center S of the face A₁B₁C₁D₁. This face is the top face, which is a square. The center S would be the average of the coordinates of its vertices. Let&#39;s compute that. The vertices are A₁ (0,0,a), B₁ (a,0,a), C₁ (a,a,a), D₁ (0,a,a). So, the center S is ((0 + a + a + 0)/4, (0 + 0 + a + a)/4, (a + a + a + a)/4) = (a/2, a/2, a). Alternatively, since it&#39;s a square, the center is halfway between opposite vertices. For example, the center between A₁ and C₁ would be ((0 + a)/2, (0 + a)/2, (a + a)/2) = (a/2, a/2, a). Same result.So, S is at (a/2, a/2, a).Now, we need the distance from point P (a, a/2, 0) to the line passing through A (0,0,0) and S (a/2, a/2, a).To find the distance from a point to a line in 3D space, we can use the formula:Distance = |(P - A) × (S - A)| / |S - A|Where × denotes the cross product.First, let&#39;s find the vector from A to S: S - A = (a/2, a/2, a) - (0,0,0) = (a/2, a/2, a).Then, the vector from A to P: P - A = (a, a/2, 0) - (0,0,0) = (a, a/2, 0).But actually, the formula uses the vector from a point on the line to the external point. Here, since the line passes through A, the vector from A to P is indeed (a, a/2, 0). Then, the cross product of vectors AP and AS divided by the length of AS gives the distance.Wait, let me verify the formula. The distance from point P to the line through points A and S is equal to the length of the cross product of vectors AP and AS divided by the length of AS.Wait, actually, the standard formula is:If the line is parametrized as A + t*(S - A), then the distance from P to the line is |(P - A) × (S - A)| / |S - A|.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, vectors here are:Vector AP = P - A = (a, a/2, 0)Vector AS = S - A = (a/2, a/2, a)Compute their cross product.First, let&#39;s compute the cross product (AP) × (AS):AP = (a, a/2, 0)AS = (a/2, a/2, a)The cross product components are:i component: (a/2 * a - 0 * a/2) = (a²/2 - 0) = a²/2j component: -(a * a - 0 * a/2) = - (a² - 0) = -a²k component: (a * a/2 - a/2 * a/2) = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4Wait, cross product formula:If vector u = (u1, u2, u3) and vector v = (v1, v2, v3),then u × v = (u2v3 - u3v2, u3v1 - u1v3, u1v2 - u2v1)So, let&#39;s compute component-wise:i component: AP_y * AS_z - AP_z * AS_y = (a/2)*a - 0*(a/2) = (a²/2 - 0) = a²/2j component: AP_z * AS_x - AP_x * AS_z = 0*(a/2) - a*a = 0 - a² = -a²k component: AP_x * AS_y - AP_y * AS_x = a*(a/2) - (a/2)*(a/2) = (a²/2 - a²/4) = a²/4Therefore, the cross product vector is (a²/2, -a², a²/4)The magnitude of this cross product is sqrt[(a²/2)^2 + (-a²)^2 + (a²/4)^2] = sqrt[(a^4/4) + a^4 + (a^4/16)]Convert all terms to sixteenths:(a^4/4) = 4a^4/16a^4 = 16a^4/16(a^4/16) = 1a^4/16Total under sqrt: (4 + 16 + 1)a^4/16 = 21a^4/16So, magnitude is sqrt(21a^4/16) = (a²/4)*sqrt(21)Then, the magnitude of vector AS is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + a^2] = sqrt[a²/4 + a²/4 + a²] = sqrt[ (2a²/4) + a² ] = sqrt[ a²/2 + a² ] = sqrt[ 3a²/2 ] = (a)sqrt(3/2) = a*sqrt(6)/2Therefore, the distance is |AP × AS| / |AS| = (a²/4 * sqrt(21)) / (a*sqrt(6)/2) ) = (a² * sqrt(21)/4) / (a*sqrt(6)/2) ) = (a * sqrt(21)/4) / (sqrt(6)/2) ) = (a * sqrt(21)/4) * (2 / sqrt(6)) ) = (a * sqrt(21) * 2 ) / (4 * sqrt(6)) ) = (a * sqrt(21) ) / (2 * sqrt(6)) )Simplify sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(21/6) = sqrt(7/2)Therefore, the distance is (a * sqrt(7/2)) / 2 = a * sqrt(7/2) / 2 = a * sqrt(14)/ (2*2) ) = a*sqrt(14)/4 ?Wait, wait, let me check that again.sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) is sqrt(21/6) = sqrt(7/2), correct. So then:sqrt(7/2) = sqrt(14)/sqrt(4) = sqrt(14)/2. Wait, sqrt(7/2) is equal to sqrt(14)/2, yes. Because sqrt(7)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(14)/2.Therefore, sqrt(21)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(7/2) = sqrt(14)/2.Therefore, the distance is a * (sqrt(14)/2) / 2 = a * sqrt(14)/4.So, the distance from P to the line AS is (a√14)/4.So, that&#39;s the first part.Now, the second part: the area of the cross-section of the cube cut by the plane APS. So, the plane passes through points A, P, and S.First, let&#39;s identify the coordinates of these points:- A: (0,0,0)- P: (a, a/2, 0)- S: (a/2, a/2, a)So, we need to find the polygon formed by the intersection of the plane APS with the cube. The cross-section will be a polygon, likely a triangle or quadrilateral, depending on how the plane cuts through the cube.But since three non-collinear points define a plane, and these three points are A, P, S. The plane APS will intersect the cube along the edges and possibly some faces. To find the cross-sectional area, we need to determine all the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges, then determine the polygon&#39;s vertices and compute its area.First, let&#39;s see which edges of the cube the plane APS intersects.Given that A is a vertex of the cube, P is a midpoint of BC, and S is the center of the top face. So, connecting A to P to S to A forms a triangle. But when we extend this plane, it might intersect other edges of the cube.Let me list the edges of the cube and check if the plane APS intersects them.But maybe a better approach is to parametrize the plane equation and find where it intersects the cube edges.First, let&#39;s find the equation of the plane APS. To do this, we can compute the normal vector using the three points A, P, S.Vectors AP and AS can be used to compute the normal vector.AP vector: P - A = (a, a/2, 0)AS vector: S - A = (a/2, a/2, a)The normal vector n is the cross product of AP and AS.We already computed this earlier: (a²/2, -a², a²/4). So, normal vector n = (a²/2, -a², a²/4). We can divide by a²/4 to simplify, getting n = (2, -4, 1). So, the plane equation is 2(x - 0) -4(y - 0) +1(z - 0) = 0 =&gt; 2x -4y + z = 0.So, plane equation: 2x -4y + z = 0.Now, to find the intersection of this plane with the cube. The cube is from x=0 to a, y=0 to a, z=0 to a.We need to check which edges of the cube intersect the plane. Each edge is along one axis, so we can parametrize each edge and see if it intersects the plane.First, let&#39;s list all edges of the cube:Base face ABCD:- AB: from A(0,0,0) to B(a,0,0)- BC: from B(a,0,0) to C(a,a,0)- CD: from C(a,a,0) to D(0,a,0)- DA: from D(0,a,0) to A(0,0,0)Top face A₁B₁C₁D₁:- A₁B₁: from A₁(0,0,a) to B₁(a,0,a)- B₁C₁: from B₁(a,0,a) to C₁(a,a,a)- C₁D₁: from C₁(a,a,a) to D₁(0,a,a)- D₁A₁: from D₁(0,a,a) to A₁(0,0,a)Vertical edges:- AA₁: from A(0,0,0) to A₁(0,0,a)- BB₁: from B(a,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a)- CC₁: from C(a,a,0) to C₁(a,a,a)- DD₁: from D(0,a,0) to D₁(0,a,a)Now, the plane APS already contains points A, P, S. So, we know it intersects the cube at least at these three points. But since a plane cutting a cube usually intersects along a polygon (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, or hexagon), depending on how it&#39;s oriented.But since the plane passes through three points: A (a vertex), P (midpoint of BC), and S (center of the top face), it&#39;s possible that the cross-section is a quadrilateral or triangle.But let&#39;s check other edges:First, let&#39;s check edges adjacent to A. Since A is on the plane, those edges (AB, AD, AA₁) either lie on the plane or not. Let&#39;s see:Edge AA₁: from A(0,0,0) to A₁(0,0,a). Let&#39;s plug into the plane equation. For point A₁(0,0,a):2*0 -4*0 +a = a ≠ 0. So, edge AA₁ is only at A on the plane.Edge AB: from A(0,0,0) to B(a,0,0). Point B(a,0,0): 2a -0 +0 = 2a ≠0. So, only A is on the plane.Edge AD: from A(0,0,0) to D(0,a,0). Point D(0,a,0): 0 -4a +0 = -4a ≠0. So, only A is on the plane.So, no other intersections on edges adjacent to A.Now, check edge BC where P is the midpoint. Since P is already on the plane, edge BC is from B(a,0,0) to C(a,a,0). Point B is not on the plane (as checked earlier), point C(a,a,0): 2a -4a +0 = -2a ≠0. So, only point P is on edge BC.Point S is on the top face. Let&#39;s check edges adjacent to S. Wait, S is the center of the top face, not a vertex. So, it&#39;s not on any edge. Therefore, the plane passes through S, which is inside the top face. So, we need to check if the plane intersects any edges of the top face.Top face edges:A₁B₁: from (0,0,a) to (a,0,a). Let&#39;s parametrize this edge as (x, 0, a), x from 0 to a. Plug into plane equation 2x -4*0 +a = 2x +a. Set equal to 0: 2x +a =0 =&gt; x= -a/2. Not in [0,a]. So, no intersection.B₁C₁: from (a,0,a) to (a,a,a). Parametrize as (a, y, a), y from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2a -4y +a = 3a -4y =0 =&gt; y=3a/4. Since a &gt;0, 3a/4 is between 0 and a. So, this edge intersects the plane at (a, 3a/4, a). Let&#39;s call this point Q.C₁D₁: from (a,a,a) to (0,a,a). Parametrize as (x, a, a), x from a to 0. Plane equation: 2x -4a +a =2x -3a=0 =&gt; x=3a/2. But 3a/2 &gt;a, so no intersection.D₁A₁: from (0,a,a) to (0,0,a). Parametrize as (0, y, a), y from a to 0. Plane equation: 0 -4y +a = -4y +a=0 =&gt; y=a/4. So, this edge intersects the plane at (0, a/4, a). Let&#39;s call this point R.Vertical edges:Check edge CC₁: from C(a,a,0) to C₁(a,a,a). Parametrize as (a,a,z), z from 0 to a. Plane equation: 2a -4a +z = -2a + z =0 =&gt; z=2a. But z=2a is outside the cube, so no intersection.Edge BB₁: from B(a,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a). Parametrize as (a,0,z). Plane equation: 2a -0 +z =2a + z=0 =&gt; z=-2a. Outside the cube, so no intersection.Edge DD₁: from D(0,a,0) to D₁(0,a,a). Parametrize as (0,a,z). Plane equation: 0 -4a + z = -4a + z=0 =&gt; z=4a. Outside the cube, no intersection.Edge DA: already checked.Edge CD: from C(a,a,0) to D(0,a,0). Parametrize as (x,a,0), x from a to 0. Plane equation: 2x -4a +0 =2x -4a=0 =&gt;x=2a. Outside, so no intersection.Edge AB: already checked.Edge BC: already checked, intersects at P.Edge AD: already checked.Edge A₁B₁: intersects at Q?Wait, in the top face edges:We found two intersections: point Q on B₁C₁ at (a, 3a/4, a) and point R on D₁A₁ at (0, a/4, a). Additionally, point S is the center of the top face, but since S is (a/2, a/2, a), does it lie on the plane? Let&#39;s check:2*(a/2) -4*(a/2) +a = a -2a +a =0. Yes, S is on the plane. So, the plane passes through S as expected. But S is not on an edge, it&#39;s the center of the face. So, in the top face, the plane intersects the edge B₁C₁ at Q and D₁A₁ at R, and passes through S. But S is inside the face, so maybe the cross-section in the top face is the triangle QRS? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the cross-section polygon will have vertices where the plane intersects cube edges.So, we have the following intersection points:1. A(0,0,0) – original vertex.2. P(a, a/2, 0) – midpoint of BC.3. Q(a, 3a/4, a) – intersection with edge B₁C₁.4. R(0, a/4, a) – intersection with edge D₁A₁.5. S(a/2, a/2, a) – center of top face, but it&#39;s inside the face, not on an edge.Wait, but S is part of the plane APS, but since the plane passes through S, which is not on any edge, but in the center. However, when considering the cross-section, the intersection of the plane with the cube will only include points where the plane intersects the cube&#39;s edges or vertices. However, since S is inside the top face, the plane must intersect the top face along a line passing through S and intersecting two edges. Wait, but we already found Q and R on edges of the top face. So, the plane intersects the top face along the line QR, which passes through S? Let&#39;s check:Points Q(a, 3a/4, a) and R(0, a/4, a). Let&#39;s see if S(a/2, a/2, a) lies on QR.Parametrize QR: from Q(a, 3a/4, a) to R(0, a/4, a). The parametric equations can be written as x = a - a*t, y = 3a/4 - (3a/4 - a/4)*t = 3a/4 - (a/2)t, z = a, where t in [0,1].At t=0.5, x = a - a*(0.5) = a/2, y = 3a/4 - (a/2)*(0.5) = 3a/4 - a/4 = 2a/4 = a/2. So, yes, when t=0.5, the point is S(a/2, a/2, a). Therefore, the line QR passes through S, so the plane intersects the top face along QR, passing through S. Therefore, the cross-section polygon includes points A, P, Q, R, and S? Wait, but polygon vertices are the intersection points on the edges.But wait, let&#39;s list all the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges:- A(0,0,0) (vertex)- P(a, a/2, 0) (midpoint of BC)- Q(a, 3a/4, a) (on edge B₁C₁)- R(0, a/4, a) (on edge D₁A₁)Is there any other intersection? Let&#39;s check vertical edges.Edge CC₁: from C(a,a,0) to C₁(a,a,a). As checked earlier, plane intersects at z=2a, outside the cube.Edge BB₁: from B(a,0,0) to B₁(a,0,a). Plane equation 2a + z =0, z=-2a, outside.Edge DD₁: from D(0,a,0) to D₁(0,a,a). Plane equation -4a + z =0 =&gt; z=4a, outside.Edge AA₁: already checked, only at A.Edge AB: already checked.So, the only intersection points are A, P, Q, R. Wait, but S is on the plane and lies on QR. So, S is a point on the cross-section, but it&#39;s not an intersection with an edge, so maybe the cross-section is a pentagon? A-P-Q-S-R-A? But S is inside the face. Wait, but in cross-sections, only the intersections with edges count as vertices. Wait, no, actually, the cross-section is the set of points where the plane intersects the cube&#39;s faces. So, if the plane passes through a face&#39;s interior (like the top face at point S), then the cross-section within that face is a line segment. However, since S is the center and the plane intersects the top face along QR passing through S, then in the top face, the cross-section is the line segment QR. Similarly, in the base face, the cross-section is AP. Then, connecting these through the vertical intersections?Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The cross-section polygon is formed by all the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges. So, starting from A, going to P on BC, then from P, does the plane intersect another edge? Wait, AP is on the base face. From P, the plane goes up to S, but S is inside the top face. However, the cross-section polygon must be a closed polygon formed by the intersections.Wait, the plane intersects the cube in several edges. Let&#39;s list all intersection points again:1. A (vertex)2. P (midpoint of BC)3. Q (intersection with B₁C₁)4. R (intersection with D₁A₁)Are there any others? Let&#39;s check the vertical edge from P upwards? But P is on BC, which is a horizontal edge on the base face. There is no vertical edge from P. The vertical edges are from the vertices. Similarly, are there intersections on other edges?Wait, let&#39;s check the edge from C to C₁: parametrize as (a,a,z). Plane equation: 2a -4a + z = -2a + z =0 ⇒ z=2a, which is outside.Edge from D to D₁: (0,a,z). Plane equation: 0 -4a + z = -4a + z =0 ⇒ z=4a, outside.Edge from B to B₁: (a,0,z). Plane equation: 2a -0 + z = 2a + z =0 ⇒ z=-2a, outside.So, no other intersections. So, the cross-section polygon is A-P-Q-R connected back to A? Wait, but how?From A(0,0,0), the plane goes to P(a, a/2, 0). From P, since the plane also passes through S(a/2, a/2, a), but S is inside the top face, the plane must intersect some edge above P. But the only intersections above are Q and R.Wait, maybe the polygon is A-P-Q-S-R-A? But S is not on an edge. Wait, no. Since S is on the plane and inside the top face, but the cross-section polygon must consist of points where the plane intersects cube edges. So, S is not a vertex of the cross-section polygon.Wait, actually, in the cross-section, the intersection with each face of the cube is a line segment. Since the plane intersects the cube, it can intersect up to six edges, forming a hexagon, but in this case, we have four intersection points: A, P, Q, R. Wait, but A is a vertex. Let me think again.The cross-section polygon is formed by the ordered set of points where the plane intersects the cube edges. Each time the plane crosses from one face to another, it intersects an edge.Let me try to order the points.Starting at A(0,0,0), which is a vertex. The plane leaves the base face through edge BC at point P(a, a/2, 0). Then, the plane enters the vertical face containing BC and B₁C₁. It needs to exit this face through another edge. But which edge?Wait, the plane passes through P and S. Since S is in the top face, the plane would go from P upwards through the cube. However, in the vertical edge from P, which isn&#39;t a cube edge. Therefore, the plane must intersect another edge on its way up. Wait, but we already found that on the top face edges B₁C₁ and D₁A₁, the plane intersects at Q and R.So, after P, the plane goes through the cube and intersects edge B₁C₁ at Q(a, 3a/4, a). Then, from Q, the plane continues through the top face towards R(0, a/4, a), intersecting edge D₁A₁. Then, from R, the plane goes down to A, but R is on edge D₁A₁, which connects to A₁, not A. Wait, but the cross-section is a closed polygon. Let&#39;s see.Wait, perhaps the cross-section is a quadrilateral: A-P-Q-R-A?But from R(0, a/4, a), how does it connect back to A(0,0,0)? The line from R to A would pass through the vertical edge D₁A₁, but A is not on that edge. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s another intersection point on a different edge.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an intersection on edge D₁A₁ (which is from D₁(0,a,a) to A₁(0,0,a)) at R(0, a/4, a). So, from R, moving down along the plane, does it intersect another edge?Wait, parametrize the line from R to A. Wait, but in the plane APS, moving from R to A, we would pass through the interior of the cube. However, we need to check if this line intersects any other cube edges.But according to the earlier analysis, the plane intersects the cube at A, P, Q, R. So, the cross-section should be a quadrilateral with vertices A, P, Q, R. But how does it close?Wait, connecting A to P to Q to R and back to A. Let&#39;s check if these points are coplanar (they are, by definition) and if the connections are along the plane.But the line from R to A: R is (0, a/4, a), A is (0,0,0). This line is along the y and z axes. Let&#39;s see if this line lies on the plane 2x -4y + z =0.Parametrize the line from R to A as x=0, y= a/4 - (a/4)t, z= a - a t, where t from 0 to1.Plug into plane equation: 2*0 -4*(a/4 - a/4 t) + (a - a t) = 0 -4*(a/4)(1 - t) + a(1 - t) = -a(1 - t) + a(1 - t) =0. So, yes, the entire line from R to A lies on the plane. However, this line is not along a cube edge, but passes through the interior of the cube. Therefore, in terms of the cross-section polygon, the edges of the polygon are the intersections of the plane with the cube&#39;s faces, which would be line segments connecting A-P, P-Q, Q-R, and R-A. Therefore, the cross-section is a quadrilateral APQR.But wait, connecting R to A is through the interior, but according to the definition of cross-section, it&#39;s the intersection of the plane with the cube, which includes all points of the cube that are on the plane. Therefore, the cross-section is the polygon whose vertices are the intersection points of the plane with the cube edges. In this case, the vertices are A, P, Q, R. So, it&#39;s a quadrilateral. However, we must verify if there are any other intersection points.Wait, but S is also on the plane and inside the top face. However, since S is not on an edge, it doesn&#39;t count as a vertex. The cross-section polygon is formed by the intersection points on the edges. So, the cross-section is quadrilateral APQR.But let&#39;s verify this. Let&#39;s see the shape:- A(0,0,0)- P(a, a/2, 0)- Q(a, 3a/4, a)- R(0, a/4, a)Connecting these points in order. Let&#39;s confirm that each adjacent pair is connected by an edge of the polygon lying on a face of the cube.Edge AP: lies on the base face (z=0), from A to P.Edge PQ: connects P(a, a/2, 0) to Q(a, 3a/4, a). This line passes through the vertical face BCB₁C₁. Since both P and Q are on this face (BC is on the base, B₁C₁ is on the top), the line PQ lies on this face, which is a square. Wait, but PQ goes from (a, a/2, 0) to (a, 3a/4, a). This is a line along x=a, from y=a/2, z=0 to y=3a/4, z=a. This is indeed an edge of the polygon lying on the vertical face BCB₁C₁.Edge QR: connects Q(a, 3a/4, a) to R(0, a/4, a). This lies on the top face (z=a), forming a line from (a, 3a/4, a) to (0, a/4, a). This line is the intersection of the plane with the top face.Edge RA: connects R(0, a/4, a) to A(0,0,0). This line passes through the vertical face ADA₁D₁. Since R is on edge D₁A₁ and A is on edge AD, the line RA goes from (0, a/4, a) to (0,0,0), lying on the face ADA₁D₁.Therefore, the cross-section is indeed a quadrilateral APQR with vertices at A, P, Q, R.Now, to compute the area of quadrilateral APQR. Since it&#39;s a quadrilateral in 3D space, we can divide it into two triangles or use the shoelace formula if we can project it onto a 2D plane. Alternatively, compute the area using vectors.First, let&#39;s find the coordinates of all four points:A: (0,0,0)P: (a, a/2, 0)Q: (a, 3a/4, a)R: (0, a/4, a)We can compute vectors for the quadrilateral and use the cross product to find the area.Alternatively, since the quadrilateral lies on a plane, we can find a coordinate system on that plane and compute the area.Alternatively, split the quadrilateral into two triangles: APR and AQR? Wait, no, better to split into triangles APQ and AQR? Wait, no. The quadrilateral APQR can be split into triangles APQ and AQR? Wait, let&#39;s see:Wait, the quadrilateral is APQR. So, splitting into triangles APR and PQR? Or APQ and PQR?Wait, no, the quadrilateral can be split into triangles APQ and AQR. But we need to ensure the triangles are part of the quadrilateral.Wait, actually, the correct way is to split it into two triangles that share a diagonal. For example, split APQR into APQ and AQR. Let&#39;s check:- Triangle APQ: points A, P, Q.- Triangle AQR: points A, Q, R.But does this cover the entire quadrilateral? No, because the edge QR is part of the quadrilateral, and splitting at AQ would create two triangles. Alternatively, split into APR and PRQ? But R is connected to A and Q.Alternatively, use the shoelace formula in 3D by projecting onto a 2D plane.To compute the area of a planar polygon in 3D, one method is:1. Find a normal vector to the plane.2. Compute the area by taking half the magnitude of the sum of cross products of consecutive vectors.But perhaps an easier way is to use the following formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices in order:Area = 1/2 |Σ (Vi × Vi+1)|, where Vi are vectors from the origin.But I might be mixing formulas. Alternatively, use the following approach:Since the quadrilateral is planar, we can parameterize it in 2D by projecting onto a coordinate system aligned with the plane.Alternatively, use vectors and compute the area via the cross product.Let me consider vectors AP, AQ, AR, etc.But perhaps splitting the quadrilateral into two triangles and summing their areas is simpler.First, compute the area of triangle APQ.Points:A(0,0,0), P(a, a/2, 0), Q(a, 3a/4, a)Vectors AP = P - A = (a, a/2, 0)AQ = Q - A = (a, 3a/4, a)The area of triangle APQ is (1/2) |AP × AQ|Compute the cross product:AP × AQ = |i   j   k|             a  a/2  0             a 3a/4  a= i*( (a/2)*a - 0*(3a/4) ) - j*( a*a - 0*a ) + k*( a*(3a/4) - a/2*a )= i*( a²/2 - 0 ) - j*( a² - 0 ) + k*( (3a²/4) - (a²/2) )= (a²/2)i - a²j + (3a²/4 - 2a²/4)k= (a²/2)i - a²j + (a²/4)kThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (a²/2)^2 + (-a²)^2 + (a²/4)^2 )= sqrt( a⁴/4 + a⁴ + a⁴/16 )= sqrt( (4a⁴ + 16a⁴ + a⁴)/16 )= sqrt(21a⁴/16 )= (a²/4)sqrt(21)Therefore, area of triangle APQ is (1/2)*(a²/4)*sqrt(21) = (a²/8)sqrt(21)Next, compute the area of triangle AQR.Points A(0,0,0), Q(a, 3a/4, a), R(0, a/4, a)Vectors AQ = Q - A = (a, 3a/4, a)AR = R - A = (0, a/4, a)The area of triangle AQR is (1/2)|AQ × AR|Compute the cross product AQ × AR:|i   j   k|a  3a/4  a0  a/4   a= i*( (3a/4)*a - a*(a/4) ) - j*( a*a - a*0 ) + k*( a*(a/4) - 3a/4*0 )= i*( (3a²/4 - a²/4) ) - j*(a² - 0) + k*(a²/4 - 0)= i*(2a²/4) - a²j + (a²/4)k= (a²/2)i - a²j + (a²/4)kThe magnitude is the same as before: sqrt( (a²/2)^2 + (-a²)^2 + (a²/4)^2 ) = (a²/4)sqrt(21)Therefore, area of triangle AQR is (1/2)*(a²/4)*sqrt(21) = (a²/8)sqrt(21)Therefore, total area of quadrilateral APQR is (a²/8)sqrt(21) + (a²/8)sqrt(21) = (a²/4)sqrt(21)But wait, that seems like the same as the area of each triangle. However, the cross product for both triangles APQ and AQR gave the same cross product vector? That can&#39;t be, unless the triangles are congruent, which they are not.Wait, no, let&#39;s check the cross product again for AQ × AR.AQ = (a, 3a/4, a)AR = (0, a/4, a)Compute the cross product:i component: (3a/4 * a - a * a/4) = (3a²/4 - a²/4) = 2a²/4 = a²/2j component: -(a * a - a * 0) = -a²k component: (a * a/4 - 3a/4 *0 ) = a²/4Yes, same cross product as AP × AQ. Therefore, the magnitude is the same. Hence, both triangles have the same area.Therefore, the total area is indeed (a²/8)sqrt(21) * 2 = (a²/4)sqrt(21).But let&#39;s verify this. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in assuming the quadrilateral is split into two triangles with equal area. Let&#39;s think differently.Alternatively, use vectors to find the area of the quadrilateral directly.In 3D, for a planar quadrilateral, the area can be computed as half the magnitude of the cross product of its diagonals, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, use the shoelace formula in a projected 2D coordinate system.Since the plane has a normal vector n = (2, -4, 1), we can project the 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane perpendicular to n. However, this might be complex.Alternatively, since we know the normal vector, the area can be calculated as half the magnitude of the sum of cross products of consecutive side vectors.But in general, for a planar polygon, the area can be calculated using the following formula:Area = (1/2)|Σ (Vi × Vi+1)|Where Vi are the position vectors of the vertices, and the cross product is in 3D.Let me try this.Order of vertices: A, P, Q, R.Position vectors:A: (0,0,0)P: (a, a/2, 0)Q: (a, 3a/4, a)R: (0, a/4, a)Compute the sum of Vi × Vi+1, with V4 × V1.Compute each cross product:1. A × P = (0,0,0) × (a, a/2, 0) = (0,0,0)2. P × Q = (a, a/2, 0) × (a, 3a/4, a)Compute this cross product:i: (a/2 * a - 0 * 3a/4) = a²/2j: -(a * a - 0 * a) = -a²k: (a * 3a/4 - a/2 * a) = (3a²/4 - a²/2) = a²/4So, P × Q = (a²/2, -a², a²/4)3. Q × R = (a, 3a/4, a) × (0, a/4, a)Compute cross product:i: (3a/4 * a - a * a/4) = (3a²/4 - a²/4) = 2a²/4 = a²/2j: -(a * a - a * 0) = -a²k: (a * a/4 - 3a/4 *0 ) = a²/4So, Q × R = (a²/2, -a², a²/4)4. R × A = (0, a/4, a) × (0,0,0) = (0,0,0)Summing all cross products:(0,0,0) + (a²/2, -a², a²/4) + (a²/2, -a², a²/4) + (0,0,0) = (a², -2a², a²/2)The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (a²)^2 + (-2a²)^2 + (a²/2)^2 ) = sqrt( a⁴ + 4a⁴ + a⁴/4 ) = sqrt(5a⁴ + a⁴/4) = sqrt(21a⁴/4 ) = (a²/2)sqrt(21)Therefore, area = (1/2)* (a²/2)sqrt(21) = (a²/4)sqrt(21)So, this confirms the area is (a²/4)√21.Therefore, the answers are:First part: Distance from P to line AS is (a√14)/4Second part: Area of cross-section is (a²√21)/4But let me verify again.For the distance, we had:Cross product magnitude: (a²/4)sqrt(21)Vector AS length: (a√6)/2Distance: (a²/4)sqrt(21) / (a√6/2) ) = (a sqrt(21)/4 ) * (2 / sqrt(6)) ) = (a sqrt(21) )/( 2 sqrt(6) ) = a sqrt(21/6) / 2 = a sqrt(7/2)/2 = a sqrt(14)/4. Yes, that matches.So, distance is a√14 /4.For the area, quadrilateral APQR has area (a²/4)√21. So, that&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerUdaljenost je boxed{dfrac{asqrt{14}}{4}}, a površina presjeka je boxed{dfrac{a^2sqrt{21}}{4}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given a cube (ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1) with edge length (a), we need to determine the distance from the midpoint (P) of edge (overline{BC}) to the line passing through vertex (A) and the center (S) of the face (A_1B_1C_1D_1).

Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem. First, when dealing with divisibility by 3, it&#39;s often helpful to look at numbers modulo 3. That is, categorize each number based on its remainder when divided by 3. The possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. So, numbers from 1 to 300 can be grouped into three categories:1. Numbers congruent to 0 mod 3: These are multiples of 3.2. Numbers congruent to 1 mod 3: These are numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.3. Numbers congruent to 2 mod 3: These leave a remainder of 2.Let me figure out how many numbers fall into each category. Since 300 is a multiple of 3 (300 ÷ 3 = 100), each category should have exactly 100 numbers. Let&#39;s confirm:- Numbers ≡ 0 mod 3: 3, 6, 9, ..., 300. The count is 300 ÷ 3 = 100.- Numbers ≡ 1 mod 3: 1, 4, 7, ..., 298. The last term here is 3*99 + 1 = 298, so again 100 numbers.- Numbers ≡ 2 mod 3: 2, 5, 8, ..., 299. Similarly, the last term is 3*99 + 2 = 299, so 100 numbers.Yep, each residue class has exactly 100 numbers.Now, we need to choose three numbers such that their sum is divisible by 3. Let&#39;s think about the possible combinations of residues that would satisfy this condition. The sum of the three numbers modulo 3 must be 0. So, we can have different cases where the residues add up to 0 mod 3. Let&#39;s list all possible cases:1. All three numbers are ≡ 0 mod 3. Then, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 mod 3.2. All three numbers are ≡ 1 mod 3. Then, 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.3. All three numbers are ≡ 2 mod 3. Then, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 3.4. One number from each residue class: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.Are these all the possible cases? Let&#39;s check. If we have two numbers from one residue and one from another, for example, two 0s and one 0: that&#39;s the first case. If two 1s and one 1: same as second case. Wait, actually, maybe I need to verify if there are other combinations. Let&#39;s see:Suppose we take two numbers ≡ 0 and one ≡ 0: already covered in case 1. If two numbers ≡ 0 and one ≡ 1, then sum is 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 3, which isn&#39;t 0. Similarly, two 0s and one 2: sum is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 mod 3, not 0. Similarly, two 1s and one 0: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 mod 3. Two 1s and one 2: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Two 2s and one 0: 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. Two 2s and one 1: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 ≡ 2 mod 3. So none of the combinations with two from one residue and one from another work. Similarly, mixing residues like one 0, one 1, one 2: sum 3 ≡ 0 mod 3. So, the only valid combinations are the four cases I mentioned initially: three 0s, three 1s, three 2s, or one of each.Therefore, the total number of valid schemes is the sum of the number of combinations in each case.Let&#39;s compute each case:1. Three numbers ≡ 0 mod 3: The number of ways is C(100, 3) where C(n, k) is the combination formula n! / (k!(n - k)!).2. Three numbers ≡ 1 mod 3: Similarly, C(100, 3).3. Three numbers ≡ 2 mod 3: C(100, 3).4. One number from each residue class: Here, we need to choose one number from each of the three residue classes. Since each residue class has 100 numbers, the number of ways is 100 * 100 * 100.Therefore, total schemes = 3 * C(100, 3) + 100^3.Let me compute these values step by step.First, compute C(100, 3):C(100, 3) = 100! / (3! * 97!) = (100 * 99 * 98) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (100 * 99 * 98) / 6.Calculate numerator: 100 * 99 = 9900; 9900 * 98 = let&#39;s compute that.9900 * 98: 9900 * 100 = 990,000; subtract 9900 * 2 = 19,800, so 990,000 - 19,800 = 970,200.Divide by 6: 970,200 / 6 = 161,700.So, C(100, 3) = 161,700.Therefore, three such terms (for residues 0, 1, 2) would be 3 * 161,700 = 485,100.Now, compute the fourth case: 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000.Therefore, total number of schemes = 485,100 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100.Wait, is that correct? Let me check again.Wait, 3 * C(100, 3) is 3 * 161,700 = 485,100.Adding 100^3 = 1,000,000 gives 1,485,100. That seems a lot, but let&#39;s verify if the logic is correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 300 is C(300, 3) = (300 * 299 * 298) / 6.Calculate that:300 * 299 = 89,700; 89,700 * 298. Let&#39;s compute 89,700 * 300 = 26,910,000; subtract 89,700 * 2 = 179,400. So, 26,910,000 - 179,400 = 26,730,600.Divide by 6: 26,730,600 / 6 = 4,455,100.So total possible combinations are 4,455,100. Our calculated answer is 1,485,100. Let&#39;s see if this ratio makes sense.Since the numbers are equally distributed among the three residue classes, the probability that three numbers sum to 0 mod 3 should be roughly 1/3, since there are three possible remainders. Let&#39;s check:4,455,100 / 3 ≈ 1,485,033.333... Our answer is 1,485,100, which is very close, off by about 66.666. Hmm, that&#39;s interesting. But given that the numbers are exactly divisible into the residue classes, maybe the exact answer is 1/3 of the total combinations?Wait, 4,455,100 divided by 3 is 1,485,033.333... But our answer is 1,485,100. There is a discrepancy here. Why?Ah, perhaps the distribution isn&#39;t perfectly uniform when considering combinations. Wait, but each number is equally likely in each residue class, so the probability should be exactly 1/3? Or is there a different probability?Wait, let&#39;s think of it as each residue is equally probable. For three numbers, the number of possible residue combinations is 3^3 = 27. Out of these, how many result in a sum divisible by 3?Let&#39;s count them:Case 1: All three residues the same: 3 cases (all 0, all 1, all 2). Each contributes C(100, 3) as before.Case 2: All residues different: 1 case (0,1,2). Which contributes 100*100*100.Wait, but in the total residue combinations, the number of ordered triples with all residues different is 3! = 6, but since we are choosing unordered triples, the combination corresponds to one unordered case. Hmm, perhaps not.Wait, actually, when considering the sum mod 3, the order doesn&#39;t matter. So, the total number of combinations where the sum is 0 mod 3 is indeed the three cases of all same residues plus the case of one from each residue.But since each residue class has the same size, the total number of such combinations should be exactly 1/3 of the total number of combinations. Let&#39;s check:Total combinations: C(300, 3) = 4,455,100.1/3 of that is 4,455,100 / 3 ≈ 1,485,033.333...But our calculation gave 1,485,100. So there&#39;s a difference of about 66.666. That suggests that maybe there&#39;s an error in the calculation.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check again.First, C(100, 3):100 * 99 * 98 / 6.100 * 99 = 9900.9900 * 98: 9900 * 100 = 990,000; minus 9900 * 2 = 19,800. So 990,000 - 19,800 = 970,200.970,200 / 6 = 161,700. That&#39;s correct.So 3 * 161,700 = 485,100.100^3 = 1,000,000.Total is 485,100 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100.But according to total combinations, 4,455,100, and 1/3 of that is approximately 1,485,033.333. So why the discrepancy?Wait, maybe because 300 is exactly divisible by 3, so the number of combinations is exactly 1/3 of the total? Let&#39;s check:If the number of combinations where the sum is divisible by 3 is exactly 1/3 of C(300, 3), then the answer would be 4,455,100 / 3 = 1,485,033.333... But our calculation gives 1,485,100, which is an integer.This suggests that there might be an error in the assumption that the answer is exactly 1/3. However, when the numbers are equally distributed among residues, the number of valid combinations should be exactly 1/3 of the total. So why the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and the total is actually 1,485,100, which is exactly 1/3. Wait, 4,455,100 divided by 3 is:4,455,100 ÷ 3: Let&#39;s perform the division.3 into 4: 1, remainder 1.1*10 + 4 = 14: 3*4=12, remainder 2.14 -12 =2, bring down 5: 25.3*8=24, remainder 1.25 -24=1, bring down 5: 15.3*5=15, remainder 0.Bring down 1: 01.3*0=0, remainder 1.Bring down 0: 10.3*3=9, remainder 1.Bring down 0: 10.Same as before. So 4,455,100 ÷ 3 = 1,485,033.333...But our calculation gives 1,485,100, which is 66.666... more. That&#39;s inconsistent.Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again.Wait, perhaps the case of selecting one from each residue class isn&#39;t 100^3. Wait, when you select three numbers, one from each residue class, you have to choose one number from residue 0, one from residue 1, and one from residue 2. The number of ways is 100 * 100 * 100 = 1,000,000. That&#39;s correct. Because for each of the three residues, you have 100 choices, and they&#39;re independent.Then, the three cases of all three from the same residue: 3 * C(100, 3) = 3 * 161,700 = 485,100. So total is 1,485,100.But according to total combinations, it&#39;s 4,455,100. 1,485,100 is exactly 1,485,100 / 4,455,100 ≈ 0.3333337, which is roughly 1/3, but not exactly. But since 300 is a multiple of 3, the number of triples where the sum is 0 mod 3 should be exactly 1/3 of the total number of triples. So why is there a discrepancy?Wait, perhaps there&#39;s an error in the total combinations calculation. Let&#39;s compute C(300, 3):300 * 299 * 298 / 6.Compute step by step:300 * 299 = 89,700.89,700 * 298: Let&#39;s compute 89,700 * 300 = 26,910,000. Subtract 89,700 * 2 = 179,400. So 26,910,000 - 179,400 = 26,730,600.Divide by 6: 26,730,600 ÷ 6. Let&#39;s compute:26,730,600 ÷ 6 = 4,455,100. Correct.So 4,455,100 total combinations.Then 4,455,100 / 3 = 1,485,033.333...But according to our calculation, it&#39;s 1,485,100. So there&#39;s a difference of 1,485,100 - 1,485,033.333... = 66.666...This suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. But why?Wait, perhaps the assumption that the numbers are equally distributed in residues is correct, but when combining them, the cases where all three are in the same residue class might not be exactly 3 * C(100, 3). Wait, no, that part seems correct. Each residue class has 100 numbers, so the number of ways to pick three from each is C(100, 3). Then three times that is 3 * C(100, 3). And the number of ways to pick one from each residue is 100 * 100 * 100. So that should be correct.Wait, but perhaps when the total combinations are calculated, there&#39;s an error? Let me check again.Total combinations:C(300, 3) = 300 * 299 * 298 / 6.300 / 3 = 100, 299 is prime, 298 = 2 * 149.But the calculation is 300*299*298 = 300*299 = 89,700; 89,700*298 = 26,730,600; divided by 6 gives 4,455,100. That&#39;s correct.So 4,455,100 total combinations.But according to our cases, 1,485,100, which is 1,485,100 = 4,455,100 * (1/3 + 0.0000225). So very close to 1/3, but not exactly. But how come?Wait, maybe my arithmetic in calculating 3 * C(100, 3) + 100^3 is wrong? Let me check again.C(100, 3) = 161,700. 3 * 161,700 = 485,100. 485,100 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100. Correct.But 1,485,100 * 3 = 4,455,300, which is 200 more than the total combinations. So that can&#39;t be. Wait, that can&#39;t be. If each of the three cases (sum 0, 1, 2 mod 3) had 1,485,100 combinations, then total would be 4,455,300, which exceeds the actual total. Therefore, something is wrong here.Wait, no, actually, in reality, the sums mod 3 are equally likely only if the numbers are chosen uniformly. But when you have a fixed number of elements in each residue class, the counts might not be exactly equal.Wait, but if the number of elements in each residue class is the same, then the number of combinations for each sum modulo 3 should be the same, right? For example, in a more general sense, if you have equal numbers in each residue class, then the number of triples that sum to each residue should be equal. Therefore, each should be exactly 1/3 of the total.But according to our calculation, the number is slightly higher. So why is that?Wait, let me think. Suppose there are n numbers in each residue class, where n = 100. Then the total number of triples is C(3n, 3). The number of triples with sum 0 mod 3 is 3*C(n,3) + n^3.So substituting n=100:3*C(100,3) + 100^3 = 3*(161,700) + 1,000,000 = 485,100 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100.But according to the total C(300,3) = 4,455,100, and 1,485,100 * 3 = 4,455,300, which is 200 more than the actual total. So this suggests that there&#39;s an inconsistency here.This must mean that my initial assumption is wrong. That is, the cases considered (three from one residue or one from each) do not account for all possible triples that sum to 0 mod 3. Wait, but earlier analysis showed that only these cases work. So where is the mistake?Wait, no, the mistake is actually in the total combinations. Wait, 3n choose 3 is equal to 3*C(n,3) + 3n^2*(n-1)/2 + n^3. Wait, maybe I need to decompose the total combinations.Alternatively, decompose the total number of triples based on their residue combinations:The possible residue triplets (a, b, c) where a &lt;= b &lt;= c to avoid overcounting. Then, for each triplet, calculate the number of combinations.But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the formula for the number of triples summing to 0 mod 3 when you have three residue classes each of size n is 3*C(n,3) + n^3.But according to our total combinations, 3*C(n,3) + n^3 = 1,485,100. Then, the remaining combinations must be those that sum to 1 or 2 mod 3.But total combinations is 4,455,100. 4,455,100 - 1,485,100 = 2,970,000. So 2,970,000 combinations sum to 1 or 2 mod 3. Since these should be equal in number, each would be 1,485,000. Therefore, there&#39;s a discrepancy of 100 between the two.Wait, this suggests that the counts aren&#39;t exactly equal, which might be due to the fact that 3n choose 3 is not divisible by 3 when n is an integer. Wait, 3n choose 3:C(3n, 3) = (3n)(3n - 1)(3n - 2)/6.If we plug n = 100:3n = 300, so 300*299*298/6 = 4,455,100.Now, 4,455,100 divided by 3 is 1,485,033.333... So it&#39;s not an integer, which means that the number of triples in each residue class can&#39;t all be equal. Therefore, there must be a slight imbalance. However, since the numbers are equally distributed, perhaps the difference is minimal.But according to our calculation, it&#39;s 1,485,100, which is 66.666 more than 1,485,033.333. So, how is this possible?Wait, maybe my initial approach is incorrect. Let me check with a smaller example. Let&#39;s take n=1, so numbers 1, 2, 3. How many triples sum to 0 mod 3?Only one triple: 1,2,3. So the answer is 1.But according to the formula:3*C(1,3) + 1^3 = 3*0 + 1 = 1. Correct.Total combinations C(3,3) = 1. So 1, which matches. For n=1, works.n=2: numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.Residues:0 mod 3: 3,6 (2 numbers)1 mod 3: 1,4 (2 numbers)2 mod 3: 2,5 (2 numbers)Total triples: C(6,3)=20.Number of triples summing to 0 mod 3:Three 0s: C(2,3)=0Three 1s: C(2,3)=0Three 2s: C(2,3)=0One of each: 2*2*2=8.But also, combinations like two 0s and one 0: no. Wait, but according to our previous logic, only the one of each case would contribute. However, in reality, let&#39;s list all possible triples:Possible triples:1,2,3: sum 6 ≡ 01,2,6: sum 9 ≡ 01,3,5: sum 9 ≡ 01,4,5: sum 10 ≡ 11,4,6: sum 11 ≡ 21,5,6: sum 12 ≡ 02,3,4: sum 9 ≡ 02,3,6: sum 11 ≡ 22,4,5: sum 11 ≡ 22,4,6: sum 12 ≡ 02,5,6: sum 13 ≡ 13,4,5: sum 12 ≡ 03,4,6: sum 13 ≡ 13,5,6: sum 14 ≡ 24,5,6: sum 15 ≡ 0So let&#39;s count how many sums are 0 mod 3:1,2,31,2,61,3,51,5,62,3,42,4,63,4,54,5,6That&#39;s 8 triples. According to the formula:3*C(2,3) + 2*2*2 = 0 + 8 = 8. Correct.Total triples: 20. 8/20 = 0.4. But 20/3 ≈ 6.666, so 8 is more than 1/3. Wait, this contradicts the previous idea that it should be roughly 1/3. Hmm. So in this case, the formula gives 8, which is 40% of the total.So in this small case, it&#39;s not exactly 1/3. Therefore, my initial assumption that it&#39;s exactly 1/3 is incorrect. Therefore, the formula 3*C(n,3) + n^3 is correct, and when the numbers are equally distributed, it gives a result that&#39;s not exactly 1/3 but depends on n.Therefore, in the original problem, the answer is indeed 3*C(100,3) + 100^3 = 1,485,100.But wait, in the small example, with n=2, the total number of triples is 20, and 8 of them sum to 0 mod 3, which is 40%, which is more than 1/3. So why is it higher?Wait, because in the formula, when n=2, 3*C(2,3) + 2^3 = 0 + 8 = 8, which is correct. But the total combinations C(6,3)=20. So 8 is not 1/3 of 20. Hence, the formula gives a precise count, not necessarily 1/3. Therefore, the answer depends on n.Therefore, returning to the original problem, the answer is indeed 1,485,100.Wait, but in the small case, n=2, 3*C(n,3) + n^3 = 8, which is correct. But in the original problem, n=100, so 3*C(100,3) + 100^3 = 1,485,100. Therefore, even though it&#39;s not exactly 1/3, that&#39;s the precise answer. Therefore, the correct answer is 1,485,100.But wait, let&#39;s check another small example where n=1. Numbers 1,2,3. Only one triple: 1,2,3. Sum is 6 ≡ 0 mod 3. So answer is 1. Formula: 3*C(1,3) +1^3=0+1=1. Correct.Another example, n=3. Numbers 1-9, each residue class has 3 numbers.Total triples: C(9,3)=84.Number of triples summing to 0 mod 3:3*C(3,3) +3^3=3*1 +27=30.So 30/84≈0.357, which is still more than 1/3. So in general, the formula holds, but it&#39;s not exactly 1/3.Therefore, in the original problem, the answer is indeed 1,485,100.Therefore, the number of schemes is 1,485,100.But just to confirm, let&#39;s check once more:C(100,3)=161,7003*161,700=485,100100^3=1,000,000Total=485,100+1,000,000=1,485,100.Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is boxed{1485100}Final Answerboxed{1485100}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of ways to select 3 numbers from 1 to 300 such that their sum is exactly divisible by 3, we categorize the numbers based on their remainders when divided by 3. Each residue class (0, 1, 2) contains exactly 100 numbers.The valid combinations of residues that sum to 0 modulo 3 are:1. Three numbers from the same residue class (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), or (2, 2, 2).2. One number from each residue class (0, 1, 2).Calculations:1. Three numbers from the same residue class:   - The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from one residue class is ( binom{100}{3} ).   - For three residue classes, this is ( 3 times binom{100}{3} ).   - ( binom{100}{3} = frac{100 times 99 times 98}{3 times 2 times 1} = 161700 ).   - Therefore, ( 3 times 161700 = 485100 ).2. One number from each residue class:   - The number of ways to choose one number from each residue class is ( 100 times 100 times 100 = 1000000 ).Total number of valid schemes:- Sum of the two cases: ( 485100 + 1000000 = 1485100 ).Thus, the number of schemes is (boxed{1485100}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is asking how many ways there are to select 3 numbers from 1 to 300 such that their sum is exactly divisible by 3. Hmm. So, I need to count the number of combinations of three distinct numbers where their total is a multiple of 3. First, let me recall that when dealing with divisibility by 3, it&#39;s often helpful to consider numbers modulo 3. That is, categorize numbers based on their remainder when divided by 3. The possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. So, numbers can be grouped into three categories: those that are 0 mod 3, 1 mod 3, or 2 mod 3.Let me figure out how many numbers there are in each category. From 1 to 300, inclusive. Well, 300 divided by 3 is exactly 100, so each remainder category should have exactly 100 numbers. Let&#39;s confirm:- Numbers congruent to 0 mod 3: 3, 6, 9, ..., 300. That&#39;s an arithmetic sequence starting at 3, ending at 300, with common difference 3. The number of terms is (300 - 3)/3 + 1 = (297)/3 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100. Yep.- Similarly, numbers congruent to 1 mod 3: 1, 4, 7, ..., 298. The last term here would be 3*99 + 1 = 298, right? Let&#39;s check: (298 - 1)/3 + 1 = 297/3 +1 = 99 +1=100. Correct.- Numbers congruent to 2 mod 3: 2, 5, 8, ..., 299. Same logic: (299 - 2)/3 +1= 297/3 +1=99 +1=100. So each residue class has exactly 100 numbers.So, there are three groups: R0 (remainder 0), R1 (remainder 1), R2 (remainder 2), each with 100 numbers.Now, we need to choose 3 numbers such that their sum is divisible by 3. Let&#39;s think about the possible combinations of residues that would satisfy this condition.The sum of three numbers modulo 3 is the sum of their residues modulo 3. So, for the sum to be 0 mod 3, the residues can be:1. All three numbers are 0 mod 3: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 mod 32. All three numbers are 1 mod 3: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 33. All three numbers are 2 mod 3: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 34. One number from each residue class: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3So, these are the four possible scenarios where the sum is divisible by 3. Therefore, the total number of valid combinations is the sum of the combinations from each of these four cases.Let me calculate each case separately:Case 1: All three numbers are 0 mod 3We need to choose 3 numbers from the R0 group. There are 100 numbers in R0. The number of ways to choose 3 is C(100,3), which is 100 choose 3.Case 2: All three numbers are 1 mod 3Similarly, choosing 3 from R1: C(100,3)Case 3: All three numbers are 2 mod 3Same as above: C(100,3)Case 4: One number from each residue classHere, we need to choose one number from R0, one from R1, and one from R2. The number of ways is the product of the sizes of each group: 100 * 100 * 100. But wait, hold on. Since we are choosing one from each group, it&#39;s 100 choices from R0, 100 from R1, and 100 from R2. So, the total combinations are 100 * 100 * 100 = 100^3.Wait a second, but hold on. The problem states &quot;select 3 numbers from 1 to 300&quot;. Are we allowed to have the same number multiple times? No, the problem says &quot;select 3 numbers&quot;, which implies distinct numbers. However, in this case, since each residue group is distinct (R0, R1, R2 are disjoint sets), choosing one from each group automatically gives three distinct numbers. So, 100 * 100 * 100 is correct here.Therefore, the total number of valid combinations is:C(100,3) + C(100,3) + C(100,3) + 100^3Simplify this:3*C(100,3) + 100^3Let me compute C(100,3) first. The combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)So, C(100,3) = 100*99*98 / (3*2*1) = (100*99*98)/6Let me compute that:First, 100*99 = 99009900*98 = (9900*100) - (9900*2) = 990000 - 19800 = 970200Then divide by 6: 970200 / 6 = 161700So, C(100,3) = 161700Therefore, 3*C(100,3) = 3*161700 = 485100Now, 100^3 = 1,000,000So total number of schemes is 485,100 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100Wait, but let me double-check this because 485,100 + 1,000,000 is indeed 1,485,100. Hmm.But let me confirm again if I considered all cases correctly. So, the four cases are:1. All three from R0: C(100,3)2. All three from R1: C(100,3)3. All three from R2: C(100,3)4. One from each: 100*100*100Adding those up gives 3*C(100,3) + 100^3. That seems right.But let me think again if there&#39;s another way the sum can be divisible by 3. For three numbers, the possible sums modulo 3 can be 0,1,2. The combinations that sum to 0 mod 3 are those four cases. There&#39;s no other combination. For example, if we have two numbers from R0 and one from R1, the sum would be 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mod 3. Similarly, two from R0 and one from R2: 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 mod 3. Similarly, two from R1 and one from R0: 1 +1 +0 = 2 mod 3. Two from R1 and one from R2: 1 +1 +2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod3. Two from R2 and one from R0: 2 +2 +0 =4 ≡1 mod3. Two from R2 and one from R1: 2 +2 +1=5≡2 mod3. So, none of these two-and-one combinations result in a sum divisible by 3. So, indeed, only the four cases considered above. So our calculation is correct.Therefore, the answer is 3*161700 + 1,000,000 = 1,485,100.But wait, let me check once more the multiplication: 3 times 161,700. 161,700 *3: 161,700*2=323,400, plus 161,700=485,100. Then 485,100 +1,000,000=1,485,100. Correct.But wait a second. Let me check if the problem allows selecting the same number multiple times. The problem says &quot;select 3 numbers from 1 to 300&quot;, and typically such problems imply distinct numbers unless stated otherwise. So, if the numbers must be distinct, then our calculation is correct. However, if repetition is allowed, the answer would be different. But since the problem states &quot;select 3 numbers&quot;, which usually means distinct, so I think our answer is okay.But just to be thorough, let me check both cases.If repetition is allowed, then the number of combinations would be:For case 1: All three 0 mod3: 100 numbers, with repetition allowed. So the number is C(100 +3 -1,3) = C(102,3). But the problem says &quot;select&quot;, which usually is combination without repetition. So I think repetition is not allowed. The problem is similar to choosing a committee, so distinct elements. So our initial calculation is correct.Hence, the answer is 1,485,100.Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. The total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 300 is C(300,3). The number of such combinations where the sum is divisible by 3. Since the numbers are evenly distributed modulo 3 (100 in each residue), the probability that a random combination has sum divisible by 3 should be roughly 1/3. Let&#39;s check if 1,485,100 is approximately 1/3 of C(300,3).Compute C(300,3):300*299*298 /6Compute step by step:300*299 = 89,70089,700*298: Let&#39;s compute 89,700*300 = 26,910,000, subtract 89,700*2=179,400, so 26,910,000 -179,400=26,730,600Divide by 6: 26,730,600 /6=4,455,100So, C(300,3)=4,455,100Then 1/3 of that is 4,455,100 /3≈1,485,033.333...Wait, but our answer is 1,485,100. Which is very close but not exactly equal. Hmm. There&#39;s a discrepancy of about 66.666... So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong? Because in reality, since the numbers are evenly distributed modulo 3, the number of combinations where sum is 0 mod3 should be exactly 1/3 of the total number of combinations, right? Because the sums modulo3 are equally likely? But maybe that&#39;s only approximately true when the numbers are equally distributed, but in reality, since 300 is divisible by 3, the distribution is exact. Therefore, perhaps the exact number is 1/3 of C(300,3). Let&#39;s compute it.C(300,3)=4,455,100Divide by 3: 4,455,100 ÷ 3. Let&#39;s compute this:3*1,485,033=4,455,099. Then 4,455,100 -4,455,099=1. So, 4,455,100=3*1,485,033 +1. Therefore, 4,455,100 /3=1,485,033 +1/3≈1,485,033.333...But our computed answer was 1,485,100, which is 66.666 more. So, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. That suggests that my initial approach is wrong. Which is confusing. So, where&#39;s the mistake?Wait, so according to the total number of combinations, C(300,3)=4,455,100. If the answer from the first method is 1,485,100, which is 4,455,100 -1,485,100*3=?Wait, 1,485,100 *3=4,455,300. But C(300,3)=4,455,100. So, the difference is 4,455,300 -4,455,100=200. So, according to the first method, the total number is 1,485,100, but the total combinations is 4,455,100. So, 1,485,100 is not exactly 1/3, but it&#39;s close. But according to the second approach, since the numbers are equally distributed, the exact number should be C(300,3)/3. But why is there a discrepancy?Ah, perhaps the assumption that the number of combinations where the sum is 0 mod3 is exactly 1/3 is incorrect? Wait, but in probability, when the residues are uniformly distributed and independent, the probability that the sum is 0 mod3 is 1/3. However, in reality, when selecting without replacement, the residues are not independent. But since the numbers are equally distributed in each residue class, maybe the exact number is still 1/3. Wait, but in our first approach, it&#39;s not exactly 1/3. So which one is correct?This suggests a problem in my initial reasoning.Let me check with smaller numbers. Let&#39;s take numbers from 1 to 3. So, three numbers, each residue 0,1,2. Now, how many ways to choose 3 numbers? Only 1 way, which is all three numbers. Their sum is 1+2+3=6, which is 0 mod3. So, in this case, answer is 1. But 1 is equal to C(3,3)=1. However, according to the formula in the initial approach, since there&#39;s 1 in each residue class:3*C(1,3) +1^3. But C(1,3)=0, since you can&#39;t choose 3 from 1. So 0 +1=1, which matches. But in this case, the answer is 1, which is 1= C(3,3)=1, which is indeed 1/1=1. So, here it&#39;s 100% but in our initial approach it works.Another example: numbers from 1 to 6. Each residue class 0,1,2 has 2 numbers. Let&#39;s compute how many triples sum to 0 mod3.Compute via initial approach:Case1: All three 0: C(2,3)=0Case2: All three 1: C(2,3)=0Case3: All three 2: C(2,3)=0Case4: One from each: 2*2*2=8So total is 8. But total number of triples is C(6,3)=20. 8/20=0.4, which is not 1/3. Hmm. So here the initial approach gives 8, but 20/3≈6.666. So discrepancy.But in reality, let&#39;s list all possible triples and count those with sum 0 mod3.Numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6. Residues:1:1, 2:2, 3:0, 4:1, 5:2,6:0.Possible triples:1,2,3: sum 6 ≡01,2,4: 7≡11,2,5:8≡21,2,6:9≡01,3,4:8≡21,3,5:9≡01,3,6:10≡11,4,5:10≡11,4,6:11≡21,5,6:12≡02,3,4:9≡02,3,5:10≡12,3,6:11≡22,4,5:11≡22,4,6:12≡02,5,6:13≡13,4,5:12≡03,4,6:13≡13,5,6:14≡24,5,6:15≡0Now, count the ones with sum 0 mod3:1,2,31,2,61,3,51,5,62,3,42,4,63,4,54,5,6Total of 8, which matches the initial approach. But 8 is not equal to 20/3≈6.666. So in this case, even with equal distribution, the number of triples is 8, which is 40%, not 33.333%. Therefore, my initial assumption that it&#39;s exactly 1/3 is wrong. So the discrepancy in the larger case is real, and the initial approach is correct.Therefore, the answer 1,485,100 is correct for the original problem. The alternative approach assuming 1/3 of the total is incorrect.Therefore, the answer is 1,485,100. So the correct number of schemes is boxed{1485100}.Final Answerboxed{1485100}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of ways to select 3 numbers from 1 to 300 such that their sum is divisible by 3, we consider the residues modulo 3. The numbers 1 to 300 are evenly distributed into three residue classes: 0, 1, and 2, each containing 100 numbers.We need to consider the combinations of these residues that result in a sum divisible by 3:1. All three numbers are congruent to 0 modulo 3.2. All three numbers are congruent to 1 modulo 3.3. All three numbers are congruent to 2 modulo 3.4. One number from each residue class (0, 1, and 2).Calculations:1. All three numbers from the same residue class:   - For each residue class (0, 1, 2), the number of ways to choose 3 numbers is ( binom{100}{3} ).   - Total for all three classes: ( 3 times binom{100}{3} ).2. One number from each residue class:   - The number of ways is ( 100 times 100 times 100 ).Detailed calculations:- ( binom{100}{3} = frac{100 times 99 times 98}{3 times 2 times 1} = 161700 )- Total for same residue classes: ( 3 times 161700 = 485100 )- Total for one from each class: ( 100^3 = 1000000 )Summing these results:[ 485100 + 1000000 = 1485100 ]Thus, the number of schemes is (boxed{1485100}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8b13bc3f></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8b13bc3f><span class="icon" data-v-8b13bc3f>🔑:</span>The sum of three numbers is divisible by 3 only in the following three cases:(1) The three numbers have the same remainder when divided by 3, i.e., all are divisible by 3, or all leave a remainder of 1 or 2.(2) Among the three numbers, one is divisible by 3, one leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and one leaves a remainder of 2.Divide the numbers from 1 sim 300 into three groups:A={1,4,7, cdots, 298}, where the numbers in A leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.B={2,5,8, cdots, 299}, where the numbers in B leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.C={3,6,9, cdots, 300}, where the numbers in C are divisible by 3, i.e., leave a remainder of 0.There are C(100,3) ways to choose three numbers from each of A, B, C.There are 100^{3} ways to choose one number from each of A, B, C.According to the addition principle, the number of ways to choose three numbers such that their sum is divisible by 3 isbegin{aligned}3 C(100,3)+100^{3} &amp; =3 times frac{100 times 99 times 98}{3 times 2}+1000000 &amp; =1485100end{aligned}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-7bdeb336><span data-v-7bdeb336>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
