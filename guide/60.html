1,2,3,4,5,6) is thrown 5 times, and the number on the face facing up is recorded each time. Based on the following statistical results, which of the following options can be determined that the number 6 definitely did not appear among the recorded 5 numbers?A: The median is 3, the mode is 2B: The mean is 3, the median is 2C: The mean is 3, the variance is 2D: The mean is 3, the mode is 2</div><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options (A, B, C, D) allows us to definitively say that the number 6 didn&#39;t appear in the five dice rolls. Let me start by understanding each condition and seeing if the presence of a 6 would make those conditions impossible. Let&#39;s go through each option one by one.Option A: The median is 3, the mode is 2First, the median being 3 means that when the numbers are arranged in order, the middle number (the third one) is 3. So, in five numbers sorted as [a, b, c, d, e], c = 3. The mode is 2, which means 2 appears more frequently than any other number.If a 6 were present, it would have to be either d or e (since the median is 3). Let&#39;s see if having a 6 conflicts with the mode being 2. Suppose we have a 6 in the list. Then, the numbers could be something like [2, 2, 3, 6, x], where x is another number. The mode here is 2, which is okay. But wait, we need exactly five numbers. Let&#39;s try constructing a possible set with a 6:Let me attempt to build such a set. The median is 3, so the third number is 3. The mode is 2, so 2 must appear at least twice. Let&#39;s say we have two 2s, one 3, and the remaining two numbers. If one of those remaining numbers is 6, then the other number could be something else. For example: [2, 2, 3, 4, 6]. Here, the median is 3, the mode is 2, and there&#39;s a 6. So this set satisfies the conditions of Option A but includes a 6. Therefore, Option A does not necessarily exclude the presence of 6. So A is not the answer.Option B: The mean is 3, the median is 2Mean being 3 means the total sum of the five numbers is 15. The median is 2, so the third number when sorted is 2. So the list would be [a, b, 2, d, e]. Let&#39;s see if such a list can include a 6 and still have a sum of 15.If 6 is in the list, it has to be either d or e. Let&#39;s assume e = 6. Then the numbers are [a, b, 2, d, 6]. To have a median of 2, the third number is 2, so the first two numbers (a and b) must be ≤2, and the last two (d and e) must be ≥2. But since e is 6, d can be from 2 upwards. However, the sum of all five numbers is 15.Let&#39;s try to make this work. The sum is a + b + 2 + d + 6 = 15, so a + b + d = 15 - 8 = 7. Since a and b are ≤2 (because the median is 2), let&#39;s set them both to 2. Then a + b = 4, so d = 7 - 4 = 3. Then the list is [2, 2, 2, 3, 6]. Wait, the median here is 2, mode is 2, mean is (2+2+2+3+6)/5 = 15/5 = 3. So that works, and includes a 6. Therefore, even with a median of 2 and a mean of 3, you can have a 6. So Option B is also not necessarily excluding 6. Hmm, so B isn&#39;t the answer either.Wait, but wait. Wait, in my example, the median is 2, but the list is [2, 2, 2, 3, 6], so sorted as [2, 2, 2, 3, 6]. The third number is 2, so median is 2. The sum is 15, mean is 3. So yeah, that&#39;s valid. So 6 can be present here. Therefore, B is not the answer.Option C: The mean is 3, the variance is 2Mean is 3, so sum is 15. Variance is 2. Let&#39;s recall that variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. For a sample, it&#39;s usually divided by n-1, but for population variance, it&#39;s divided by n. Since the problem says &quot;variance,&quot; I need to check whether it&#39;s sample variance or population variance. Given that it&#39;s a statistical result from five throws, I might assume it&#39;s the population variance, so divided by 5.But let&#39;s double-check. The formula for population variance (σ²) is (Σ(x_i - μ)²)/N, where μ is the mean. So here, μ = 3, N = 5. So variance of 2 would mean that Σ(x_i - 3)² = 2 * 5 = 10.So the sum of squared deviations is 10. Let&#39;s see if having a 6 in the numbers would make this possible.If one of the numbers is 6, then (6 - 3)² = 9. The remaining four numbers must sum to 10 - 9 = 1 in terms of squared deviations. Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible.The remaining four numbers must have a sum of 15 - 6 = 9. Their squared deviations from 3 must sum to 1. Let&#39;s denote the four numbers as a, b, c, d. Then:a + b + c + d = 9and(a - 3)² + (b - 3)² + (c - 3)² + (d - 3)² = 1This seems very restrictive. Let&#39;s try to find four numbers (each between 1 and 5, since die faces are 1-6, but 6 is already used once) that add up to 9 and have their squared deviations sum to 1.Wait, since each number is between 1 and 5, their deviations from 3 can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Squared deviations would be 4, 1, 0, 1, 4.But the sum of squared deviations for the four numbers needs to be 1. The only way to get a sum of 1 with four terms, each of which is 0, 1, or 4 (since numbers can&#39;t be 6 again), is to have three 0s and one 1. Because 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. So three numbers equal to 3 (deviation 0) and one number with deviation 1. So that would be a number of 4 or 2. Let&#39;s see:Suppose three 3s and one 4. Then the numbers would be 3, 3, 3, 4. Their sum is 3*3 + 4 = 13, which is 13. But we need the sum of these four numbers to be 9 (since 6 is the fifth number). 13 + 6 = 19, which is way more than 15. So this doesn&#39;t work.Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the total sum of all five numbers is 15. If one number is 6, the remaining four numbers must sum to 9. So in the previous example, three 3s and one 4 would sum to 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13, which is over 9. So that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, maybe three 3s and one 0? But 0 isn&#39;t a possible die face. So that&#39;s invalid. Wait, deviation of -3 would be (0) but die faces are 1-6. So numbers can&#39;t be 0.Wait, maybe two 3s, one 2, and one 4. Let&#39;s check sum: 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 12. Still over 9. Hmm.Alternatively, two 3s and two 1.5s? But dice only have integers. Hmm.Wait, maybe all four numbers are 3 except one. Wait, three 3s and one 0 deviation, but 0 deviation is 3. So four 3s. Sum would be 12, but we need sum 9. So 12 is too high.Alternatively, maybe two 2s and two 1s. Sum is 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6. Then 6 + 6 = 12, still not 15. Wait, no, the four numbers (excluding 6) need to sum to 9, so 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6, which is too low.Alternatively, three 2s and one 3. Sum is 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9. That works. Then their squared deviations would be:For each 2: (2 - 3)^2 = 1, so three of those sum to 3.For the 3: (3 - 3)^2 = 0.Total squared deviations: 3 + 0 = 3. But we need total squared deviations (including the 6) to be 10. So 3 (from the four numbers) + 9 (from the 6) = 12, which is higher than 10. So that&#39;s not good.Wait, but the total squared deviations need to be 10. So if we have 6, which contributes 9, the other four numbers must contribute 1. As I thought earlier, that requires three 3s and one number that deviates by 1. Let&#39;s see:Three 3s sum to 9, so the remaining number must be 0 to have a total sum of 9? But 0 isn&#39;t possible. Alternatively, three 3s and one 0 isn&#39;t possible. Wait, the four numbers (excluding 6) need to sum to 9. So three 3s sum to 9, so the fourth number must be 0, which isn&#39;t possible. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction here.Alternatively, maybe four numbers with sum 9 and squared deviations summing to 1. Is that possible?Let me see. Let&#39;s consider that the four numbers must sum to 9 and each is an integer from 1 to 5 (since 6 is already used once). Let&#39;s list possible combinations:One approach is to think of possible quadruplets (four numbers) that add up to 9. Each number is 1-5.Possible combinations:- Four 2s and a 1: 2+2+2+2=8, plus 1=9. But 1 is not a 2. Wait, no, the numbers would be [1,2,2,2,2]. But then in this case, including the 6, total sum would be 1+2+2+2+2 +6=15. Wait, but the four numbers (excluding 6) would be 1,2,2,2. Their sum is 7. Wait, no, if the total sum is 15 and 6 is one number, the remaining four numbers sum to 9. So the four numbers (excluding 6) sum to 9. So we need four numbers, each from 1-5, summing to 9. Let me find such combinations.Possible combinations of four numbers (each 1-5) summing to 9:Let me list them:1. 1,1,1,6 → but 6 is excluded here.Wait, no, the four numbers can&#39;t include 6. So all four numbers must be from 1-5.Possible combinations:Start with the smallest numbers:1,1,1,6 → invalid.1,1,2,5: Sum 9. So [1,1,2,5]. Check if this is possible.Their squared deviations:1: (1-3)^2=4, two of them: 82: (2-3)^2=15: (5-3)^2=4Total squared deviations: 8 +1 +4=13. Then adding the 6&#39;s deviation of 9 gives total variance numerator 22, which is 22/5=4.4, way higher than 2. So not good.Another combination: 1,1,3,4. Sum 9.Squared deviations:1: 4 each, two of them: 83: 04:1Total: 8 +0 +1=9. Adding 6&#39;s 9 gives 18, 18/5=3.6, still not 2.Another combination: 1,2,3,3. Sum 9.Squared deviations:1:42:13:0, two of them: 0Total:4 +1=5. Adding 6&#39;s 9 gives 14, 14/5=2.8. Still higher than 2.Another combination: 2,2,2,3. Sum 9.Squared deviations:2:1 each, three of them: 33:0Total:3. Adding 6&#39;s 9 gives 12. 12/5=2.4, still higher than 2.Another combination: 3,3,3,0 → invalid.How about 1,1,4,3? Wait, that&#39;s same as 1,1,3,4 which we did earlier.Alternatively, 2,2,3,2. Wait, that&#39;s three 2s and a 3: sum 2+2+2+3=9. Squared deviations: three 1s and a 0: total 3. Adding 6&#39;s 9 gives 12, variance 12/5=2.4.Hmm. Wait, variance is 2, so the total squared deviations must be 10. If we have a 6, the total squared deviations would be 9 (from 6) plus the sum from the other four numbers. So the other four numbers must contribute 1. Is that possible?So the four numbers (summing to 9) must have squared deviations sum to 1. As earlier, possible only if three of them are 3 (deviation 0) and one has deviation 1 (i.e., either 2 or 4). Let&#39;s check if such a combination exists.Three 3s and one 2: sum would be 3+3+3+2=11. But we need the sum to be 9. So 11 is too much.Three 3s and one 4: 3+3+3+4=13. Also too much.Alternatively, two 3s and two 2s: 3+3+2+2=10. Still over 9.Wait, maybe one 3, one 2, and two 4s: 3+2+4+4=13. Still over.Alternatively, one 3 and three 2s: 3 + 2 + 2 +2=9. That works. So numbers: 2,2,2,3. Their squared deviations: three 1s and one 0, total 3. Then adding 6&#39;s squared deviation of 9, total sum is 12. Which would make variance 12/5=2.4, which is not 2. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if we have four numbers that include a 4. Let&#39;s see: 3,3,3,0 → invalid. Or 3,3,2,1: sum 3+3+2+1=9. Squared deviations: 0+0+1+4=5. Total with 6&#39;s 9: 14. 14/5=2.8.Another idea: maybe four numbers all equal to 3 except one, but adjusted. But 3*4=12, which is over 9. Not possible.Wait, so perhaps it&#39;s impossible to have four numbers (1-5) summing to 9 with their squared deviations from 3 summing to 1. Therefore, if 6 is present, the variance can&#39;t be 2. Hence, if the variance is 2, 6 must not be present.Wait, let me confirm. Suppose there is no 6. Then all numbers are from 1-5. The mean is 3, sum is 15. Let&#39;s see if we can get variance 2.Population variance is (sum of squared deviations)/5 = 2, so sum of squared deviations is 10.Let me see if such a dataset is possible.For example, if all numbers are 3: each squared deviation is 0, total 0. Not 10.If three 3s, one 2, and one 4: squared deviations are 0,0,0,1,1. Total 2. So variance 2/5=0.4. No.Wait, perhaps more deviations.Wait, let&#39;s try [1,3,3,3,5]. Sum is 1+3+3+3+5=15. Mean 3. Squared deviations: (1-3)^2=4, three 0s, and (5-3)^2=4. Total squared deviations: 8. Variance 8/5=1.6.Not 2.Another example: [2,2,3,3,5]. Sum is 2+2+3+3+5=15. Mean 3. Squared deviations: two (2-3)^2=1, two 0s, and one 4. Total squared deviations: 1+1+0+0+4=6. Variance 6/5=1.2.Hmm. What if we have [1,2,3,4,5]. Sum 15. Squared deviations: 4,1,0,1,4. Total 10. So variance 10/5=2. Exactly 2. So this set works. So [1,2,3,4,5] has mean 3, variance 2, and no 6. That&#39;s valid.Alternatively, is there a set with a 5 and duplicates that still gives variance 2?For example, [2,2,3,4,4]. Sum is 2+2+3+4+4=15. Squared deviations: two 1s, one 0, two 1s. Total 4. Variance 4/5=0.8. No.Or [1,3,3,3,5]. As before, squared deviations 4,0,0,0,4=8. Variance 1.6.Wait, how about [1,1,3,5,5]. Sum 1+1+3+5+5=15. Squared deviations: (1-3)^2=4, two of them: 8, (5-3)^2=4, two of them: 8. Total 16. Variance 16/5=3.2.Nope.Alternatively, [2,3,3,3,4]. Sum 15. Squared deviations: 1,0,0,0,1. Total 2. Variance 2/5=0.4. Not enough.Wait, so the only set I can find with variance 2 is [1,2,3,4,5]. Are there others?Let me check another set. For instance, [1,1,4,4,5]. Sum:1+1+4+4+5=15. Squared deviations: 4,4,1,1,4. Total 14. Variance 14/5=2.8.No. Another one: [2,2,2,3,6]. Wait, no 6. How about [2,2,3,3,5]. Sum 15. Squared deviations: two 1s, two 0s, and one 4. Total 6. Variance 6/5=1.2.Wait, another example: [1,3,3,4,4]. Sum 15. Squared deviations:4,0,0,1,1. Total 6. Variance 1.2.Hmm. Maybe the only possible combination is [1,2,3,4,5]. Let&#39;s check another permutation. [1,3,4,2,5]. Same numbers. Still squared deviations sum to 10. So regardless of order, the variance is 2. So yes, that works.Alternatively, is there a set with duplicates that can still have variance 2?Suppose [2,3,3,3,4]. Sum 15. Squared deviations:1,0,0,0,1. Total 2. Variance 0.4.Too low. How about [1,2,3,3,6]. Wait, but 6 is excluded. Without 6, trying to get duplicates. Wait, maybe [1,2,2,5,5]. Sum 15. Squared deviations:4,1,1,4,4. Total 14. Variance 14/5=2.8.No. Hmm. So it seems that the only possible combination is the set [1,2,3,4,5]. So if the variance is 2 and the mean is 3, the numbers must be 1,2,3,4,5. Therefore, 6 is definitely not present. Therefore, Option C is the answer.But let me check if there&#39;s another possible combination without 6 that can also have variance 2.Suppose I take numbers [1,1,3,5,5]. Sum is 15. Squared deviations:4,4,0,4,4. Total 16. Variance 3.2.No. Another idea: [1,4,4,3,3]. Sum 15. Squared deviations:4,1,1,0,0. Total 6. Variance 1.2.No. What if I have three 3s and two 3s. Wait, all 3s. Variance 0. Not helpful.Alternatively, [2,2,4,4,3]. Sum 15. Squared deviations:1,1,1,1,0. Total 4. Variance 0.8.No. So seems like the only way to get variance 2 is to have all numbers from 1 to 5 with no repeats. Therefore, 6 is definitely not present. Hence, Option C is correct.Option D: The mean is 3, the mode is 2Mean is 3, so sum is 15. Mode is 2, so 2 appears more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s see if 6 can be included.Suppose 6 is present. Then the remaining four numbers sum to 9, and 2 must be the mode, meaning 2 appears at least twice. Let&#39;s try to construct such a set.Example: [2, 2, 3, 2, 6]. Wait, sum is 2+2+3+2+6=15. The mode is 2 (appears three times). So this set has a mean of 3, mode of 2, and includes a 6. Therefore, Option D does not exclude the presence of 6.Alternatively, [2, 2, 1, 4, 6]. Sum is 15. Mode is 2. So that works too. Hence, D is not the answer.Conclusion:After analyzing all options, only Option C (mean is 3, variance is 2) necessarily excludes the presence of 6. Because the only way to achieve a variance of 2 with a mean of 3 is by having the numbers 1,2,3,4,5, which sum to 15 and have the required squared deviations. Any presence of 6 would make the variance higher than 2.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which option definitively excludes the number 6, we analyze each condition:Option A: The median is 3, the mode is 2  - The median being 3 means the third number is 3. The mode is 2, meaning 2 appears most frequently.  - Example with 6: [2, 2, 3, 4, 6] has median 3, mode 2. Hence, 6 can be present.  - Conclusion: 6 can be present.Option B: The mean is 3, the median is 2  - Mean of 3 implies sum 15. Median 2 means the third number is 2.  - Example with 6: [2, 2, 2, 3, 6] has mean 3, median 2. Hence, 6 can be present.  - Conclusion: 6 can be present.Option C: The mean is 3, the variance is 2  - Mean of 3 implies sum 15. Variance of 2 implies sum of squared deviations is 10.  - Including 6 would contribute 9 to the squared deviations, leaving 1 for the remaining four numbers. This is impossible as shown by testing all combinations.  - Only valid set without 6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] gives sum 15 and variance 2.  - Conclusion: 6 cannot be present.Option D: The mean is 3, the mode is 2  - Mean of 3 implies sum 15. Mode is 2, meaning 2 appears most frequently.  - Example with 6: [2, 2, 3, 2, 6] has mean 3, mode 2. Hence, 6 can be present.  - Conclusion: 6 can be present.Thus, the answer is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is about determining which statistical results from rolling a cube (die) five times definitely exclude the number 6 from appearing. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different statistical measures. I need to check each option to see if having a 6 in the five numbers would make the given statistics impossible. If it&#39;s impossible, then that option is the answer. First, let&#39;s recall what each statistical term means:- Median: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are 5 numbers, the median will be the 3rd number.- Mode: The number that appears most frequently. If there&#39;s a tie, there can be multiple modes, but the problem states &quot;the mode is 2&quot;, so 2 must appear more often than any other number.- Mean: The average of the numbers, calculated by summing all numbers and dividing by 5.- Variance: A measure of how spread out the numbers are. The formula for variance (s²) is the average of the squared differences from the mean.Now, let&#39;s go through each option one by one.Option A: The median is 3, the mode is 2To have a median of 3, the third number when sorted must be 3. So, the five numbers in order are [a, b, 3, d, e], where a ≤ b ≤ 3 ≤ d ≤ e. The mode is 2, so 2 must appear more times than any other number. Let&#39;s see if 6 can be in the numbers.If 6 is present, it would be either d or e (since it&#39;s the largest number on the die). So, the numbers would be [something, something, 3, something, 6] or [something, something, 3, 6, something else]. But the mode is 2, which means at least two 2s. Let&#39;s try to construct such a set.Suppose 2 appears twice. Then, the numbers could be [2, 2, 3, x, 6], where x is ≥3. But since the median is 3, x can be 3, 4, or 5. Let&#39;s check if the mode is still 2. If x is 3, then we have two 2s and two 3s. That would make the mode both 2 and 3, which contradicts the given that the mode is only 2. Similarly, if x is 4 or 5, then there are two 2s and one each of 3, 4, 5, 6. Then the mode is still 2. Wait, but in that case, the numbers are [2, 2, 3, 4, 6], which has mode 2. So here, 6 is present, and the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, 6 can be present. So Option A cannot be determined to definitely exclude 6.Wait, but hold on. If there are two 2s, and the rest are unique numbers (3, 4, 6), then mode is 2. So that&#39;s possible. So 6 can be present. Therefore, Option A is not the answer.Option B: The mean is 3, the median is 2Mean is 3, so the total sum is 15 (since 5*3=15). The median is 2, so the third number when sorted is 2. That means at least three numbers are ≤2 and at most two numbers are ≥2. Wait, but the numbers are from 1 to 6. If the median is 2, then the third number is 2. So the first three numbers are ≤2, and the last two are ≥2.But if we need the sum to be 15, let&#39;s see if having a 6 is possible.Suppose 6 is one of the numbers. Then the five numbers are [a, b, 2, d, 6], where a ≤ b ≤2 and d ≥2. Since the median is 2, a and b must be ≤2. So possible values for a and b: 1 or 2. Let&#39;s try to maximize the sum here. If a and b are both 2, then the numbers are [2, 2, 2, d, 6]. Then the sum is 2+2+2+d+6 = 12 + d. To get a total of 15, d must be 3. So d=3. Then the numbers are [2,2,2,3,6]. Sum is 15. The median is 2, mode is 2, mean is 3. Wait, but in this case, the mode is 2 (appears three times). But the problem doesn&#39;t mention mode for Option B. The problem states for Option B: mean is 3, median is 2. So 6 can be present here. Therefore, even with 6, the conditions can be met, so Option B is not necessarily excluding 6.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another possible configuration where 6 is included. Suppose two numbers are 1 and two numbers are 2. Then the numbers would be [1,1,2, d,6]. Sum is 1+1+2+d+6 = 10 + d. To reach 15, d=5. So numbers are [1,1,2,5,6]. Median is 2, mean is 15/5=3. So here, 6 is present. Thus, 6 can be in the numbers even if the median is 2 and mean is 3. Therefore, Option B is not the answer.Wait, but hold on. In the first example, when I assumed three 2s, the mode would be 2, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention mode for Option B. The question is whether 6 can be present, and in both examples, 6 is present. Therefore, Option B cannot be determined to exclude 6. So Option B is not the answer.Option C: The mean is 3, the variance is 2Mean is 3, so sum is 15. Variance is 2. Let&#39;s recall variance formula. For a population variance (since we&#39;re dealing with the entire set of 5 numbers, not a sample), variance σ² = Σ(x_i - μ)² / N. Here, μ=3, N=5, so Σ(x_i - 3)² /5 = 2. Therefore, Σ(x_i -3)² =10.So the sum of squared deviations from the mean is 10. Let&#39;s see if having a 6 in the numbers would make this possible.First, let&#39;s compute the contribution of 6 to the sum of squared deviations. 6 -3 =3, so squared is 9. So if 6 is present, that&#39;s a contribution of 9. The remaining four numbers need to contribute 1 (since 10 -9=1). The remaining four numbers must sum to 15 -6=9. So four numbers that sum to 9, each between 1 and 5 (since 6 is already used once). Also, the sum of their squared deviations from 3 must be 1.Wait, let&#39;s check if that&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s suppose the remaining four numbers are a, b, c, d. Then:a + b + c + d =9and(a -3)^2 + (b -3)^2 + (c -3)^2 + (d -3)^2 =1Since 1 is a small number, the deviations from the mean (3) must be very small. Let&#39;s consider that each (x_i -3)^2 must be 0 or 1, because if any term is 4 or more, the sum would exceed 1.So possible deviations: 0, 1. So each x_i must be 3 (deviation 0) or 2 or 4 (deviation 1). So the remaining four numbers can only be 2,3,4.But the numbers need to be integers from 1 to 6, but we already have a 6, so the remaining numbers are 1-5. So 2,3,4 are allowed. Let&#39;s see.Sum of four numbers is 9. Let&#39;s denote the numbers as a, b, c, d, each can be 2,3,4. Let&#39;s find four numbers in 2,3,4 that sum to 9. Let&#39;s try:Possible combinations:- Four 2s: sum 8 (too low)- Three 2s and one 3: 2+2+2+3=9. Then the squared deviations: (2-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 =1+1+1+0=3. But we need sum of squared deviations to be 1. Not possible.- Two 2s and two 3s: 2+2+3+3=10. Sum is 10, which is more than 9.Wait, this approach is getting messy. Maybe think differently. The remaining four numbers must be 2,3,4, and sum to 9, with sum of squared deviations from 3 equal to 1.Let’s denote how many 2s, 3s, and 4s there are.Let’s let:Let’s say there are k numbers of 2, m numbers of 3, n numbers of 4. Then:k + m + n =4 (since four numbers)and2k +3m +4n =9 (sum equation)andsum of squares: k*(1) + m*(0) + n*(1) =1 (since (2-3)^2=1, (3-3)^2=0, (4-3)^2=1)So the sum of squares equation is k + n =1.But k and n are non-negative integers. Since k + n =1, one of them is 1 and the other is 0.Case 1: k=1, n=0Then from sum equation: 2*1 +3m +4*0=9 ⇒ 2 +3m=9 ⇒3m=7 ⇒ m=7/3. Not integer. Invalid.Case 2: k=0, n=1Then sum equation: 2*0 +3m +4*1=9 ⇒ 3m +4=9 ⇒3m=5 ⇒m=5/3. Not integer. Invalid.Therefore, there are no solutions where the remaining four numbers consist of 2s,3s,4s. Hence, it&#39;s impossible for 6 to be present because the required sum of squared deviations cannot be achieved. Therefore, if 6 is present, the variance cannot be 2. Hence, Option C must exclude 6. Therefore, the answer is C.But let me check again. Maybe there&#39;s a number 1 or 5 involved. Wait, if 6 is present, the remaining four numbers have to sum to 9, but the numbers could include 1 or 5. Wait, the remaining numbers can be 1,2,3,4,5. So maybe including a 1 or 5 would allow the sum to be 9 with higher deviations?Let’s check. Suppose one of the remaining numbers is 1. Then, we have three other numbers. Let&#39;s try:Suppose one number is 1, and the other three numbers sum to 8 (since total is 9). Let&#39;s see if that works with the squared deviations.If 1 is included, its deviation is (1-3)^2=4. Then the sum of squared deviations is 4 plus the rest. But we need total sum of squared deviations to be 10. If 6 is present (deviation 9), and 1 is present (deviation 4), then total so far is 9 +4=13, which exceeds 10. So that&#39;s impossible.Similarly, if 5 is included, deviation (5-3)^2=4. If we have 6 and 5, their deviations would be 9 +4=13, leaving the remaining three numbers needing to contribute -3, which is impossible. So including 1 or 5 would make the sum of squared deviations too large. Therefore, the remaining four numbers must be 2,3,4.But as we saw earlier, no combination of 2,3,4 can satisfy both the sum and sum of squares. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for 6 to be present. Therefore, Option C must be the answer.Option D: The mean is 3, the mode is 2Mean is 3, so sum is 15. Mode is 2, so 2 appears more frequently than any other number. Let&#39;s see if 6 can be included.If 6 is present, then the numbers are [a, b, c, d, 6]. The mode is 2, so 2 must appear at least twice. Let&#39;s try to create such a list.Suppose there are two 2s. Then the sum contributed by 2s is 4. The remaining three numbers must sum to 15 -4 -6=5. Wait, 15 - (2+2+6)=5. So the remaining two numbers (since one is 6) must sum to 5. Wait, no. Wait, if we have two 2s and one 6, that&#39;s three numbers: 2,2,6. The remaining two numbers must sum to 15 - (2+2+6)=5. So two numbers summing to 5. They can be 1 and 4, 2 and 3, or 5 and 0 (but 0 isn&#39;t on the die). But numbers must be from 1 to 6. So possibilities: 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, etc. But we already have two 2s. If we include another 2, the mode would still be 2 (three times), which is allowed. But if we use 3 and 2, we&#39;d have three 2s, which is okay. Let&#39;s check:Case 1: Numbers are 2,2,6,1,4. Sum is 2+2+6+1+4=15. Mode is 2. Here, 6 is present. So this works.Case 2: Numbers are 2,2,6,2,3. Sum is 2+2+6+2+3=15. Mode is 2 (appears three times). This also works.Therefore, 6 can be present in Option D. Hence, Option D is not the answer.So after checking all options, only Option C definitely excludes the presence of 6 because the variance constraint combined with the mean makes it impossible for 6 to be part of the numbers.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which statistical results definitely exclude the number 6, we analyze each option based on the given statistical measures:Option A: The median is 3, the mode is 2- The median being 3 means the third number is 3. The mode being 2 means 2 appears most frequently.- It is possible to have 6 in the numbers (e.g., [2, 2, 3, 4, 6]), so 6 can be present. This option does not exclude 6.Option B: The mean is 3, the median is 2- The mean being 3 implies a total sum of 15. The median being 2 means the third number is 2.- It is possible to have 6 in the numbers (e.g., [2, 2, 2, 3, 6] or [1, 1, 2, 5, 6]), so 6 can be present. This option does not exclude 6.Option C: The mean is 3, the variance is 2- The mean being 3 implies a total sum of 15. The variance being 2 implies the sum of squared deviations from the mean is 10.- If 6 is present, its deviation is 9, leaving the remaining four numbers to contribute 1 to the sum of squared deviations. However, no combination of numbers (2, 3, 4) can achieve this, and including 1 or 5 would exceed the required variance. Thus, 6 cannot be present. This option excludes 6.Option D: The mean is 3, the mode is 2- The mean being 3 implies a total sum of 15. The mode being 2 means 2 appears most frequently.- It is possible to have 6 in the numbers (e.g., [2, 2, 6, 1, 4] or [2, 2, 6, 2, 3]), so 6 can be present. This option does not exclude 6.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>To solve this problem, we analyze each option step by step to determine which one ensures that the number 6 definitely did not appear among the recorded 5 numbers.Option A: The median is 3, the mode is 2Given that the median is 3, the numbers must be arranged such that 3 is in the middle when sorted.

First, problem (1). So, there are 4 red cards labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 2 blue cards labeled 1, 2. We need to draw four different cards, and the requirement is that at least one blue card is included. The question is asking how many different ways there are to do this.Hmm, when I see &quot;at least one,&quot; my first thought is that maybe it&#39;s easier to calculate the total number of ways without any restrictions and then subtract the number of ways that don&#39;t meet the requirement (which would be all red cards). That usually works for these kinds of problems. Let me check if that&#39;s applicable here.Total number of cards is 6: 4 red and 2 blue. We need to draw 4 different cards. So, the total number of ways without any restrictions is the combination of 6 cards taken 4 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!).Calculating C(6, 4): 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. Wait, 6*5 is 30, divided by 2 is 15. Yeah, that&#39;s right. So total ways are 15.Now, the number of ways to draw all red cards. There are 4 red cards, so we need to choose all 4 of them. Since we&#39;re drawing 4 cards, that&#39;s only one combination: C(4, 4) = 1. Therefore, the number of ways with at least one blue card would be total ways minus all red ways: 15 - 1 = 14. So is the answer 14?Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm. The problem says four different cards. But the blue cards have numbers 1 and 2, which are the same numbers as the red cards. However, the problem specifies &quot;different cards.&quot; So, are the blue 1 and red 1 considered different cards? The problem says &quot;four different cards,&quot; so I think each card is unique based on color and number. So even though the numbers are the same, the color makes them different. Therefore, when we draw four different cards, we have to consider color as well. Wait, but in the original problem statement, it says &quot;4 red cards labeled with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 2 blue cards labeled with the numbers 1, 2.&quot; So each card is uniquely identified by color and number. So the total number of different cards is 6: red1, red2, red3, red4, blue1, blue2. So when we draw four different cards, we are selecting four distinct cards from these six, considering both color and number. So the total number of combinations is indeed C(6,4)=15. The all-red cards would be selecting four cards from the four red ones: C(4,4)=1. So subtracting gives 14. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is 14. Hmm, but let me think again to make sure.Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the numbers, not the colors? Like, if two cards have the same number but different colors, are they considered different? The problem says &quot;four different cards.&quot; If &quot;different&quot; refers to the combination of color and number, then yes, they are different. For example, red1 and blue1 are different cards. So when you draw them, they count as different. So, in that case, the total number is 15, all-red is 1, so 14. That seems right.Alternatively, if &quot;different&quot; was referring only to the numbers, but that doesn&#39;t make sense because blue1 and red1 have the same number but different colors. So the problem must be considering each card as unique, so the total combinations are 15, subtract the all-red case, which is 1, so 14. So part (1) answer is 14. Alright, moving on to part (2).Problem (2): If the sum of the numbers on the four drawn cards equals 10, and they are arranged in a row, how many different arrangements are there?Hmm. So first, we need to find all possible combinations of four cards (with color considered) such that their numbers sum to 10. Then, for each such combination, calculate the number of permutations (arrangements in a row), and sum them up.So first step: find all possible sets of four different cards (red1, red2, red3, red4, blue1, blue2) where the sum of their numbers is 10.Then, for each such set, compute the number of arrangements, which is 4! = 24, but if there are duplicate numbers, we have to divide by the factorial of the number of duplicates. Wait, but in this case, since the cards are different even if they have the same number (because of different colors), we might not have duplicates. Wait, for example, if a combination includes both red1 and blue1, those are two different cards, even though they have the same number. So, when arranging them in a row, each card is unique, so the number of arrangements is 4! = 24 for each combination. However, if in the combination, there are two cards with the same number (like red1 and blue1), but different colors, then they are considered different, so their arrangements are still unique.Wait, so actually, if we have a combination that includes both red1 and blue1, when we arrange them, swapping red1 and blue1 would count as different arrangements. Therefore, even though the numbers are the same, the color makes them distinct. Therefore, all arrangements are unique. So for each combination, regardless of number duplicates, since color differentiates them, the number of arrangements is 4! = 24.But first, let&#39;s find all such combinations. Let&#39;s consider the numbers. Each card has a number: red1, red2, red3, red4, blue1, blue2. So numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2. So we need four numbers (with their colors) that sum to 10. But the same number can be used in different colors. However, since we can&#39;t have duplicate cards (each card is unique), we can have at most two 1s (red1 and blue1) and two 2s (red2 and blue2). So possible numbers in the four-card set can include up to two 1s and two 2s, but only one each of 3 and 4.So the problem reduces to finding all subsets of four cards (with numbers as above) such that their sum is 10. Let&#39;s think about the possible combinations of numbers. Let&#39;s denote the numbers: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. But actually, each number is associated with a color. However, for the sum, only the numbers matter. Wait, but we need to track the numbers and their possible colors. Let me approach this step by step.First, let&#39;s think of possible number combinations (ignoring color for a moment) that sum to 10. The numbers available are 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. So possible combinations of four numbers from these.Possible number combinations (with possible duplicates):Case 1: 1, 1, 2, 6. Wait, no, 6 isn&#39;t available. The numbers are up to 4.Wait, maybe list all possible quadruples that sum to 10.Possible quadruples:Let&#39;s see. The maximum sum is 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 11. But we need 10. So subtract 1 from that. Alternatively, let&#39;s list all possible combinations.Possible combinations:1. 4, 3, 2, 1: Sum is 10.2. 4, 2, 2, 2: But there are only two 2s available, so this isn&#39;t possible.3. 3, 3, 2, 2: Only one 3 available.4. 4, 1, 2, 3: Same as the first one.Wait, maybe 4, 3, 2, 1 is the only possible unique combination if we take all distinct numbers. But wait, we have two 1s and two 2s. So maybe we can replace one of the 1s with another 1, but since they are different cards, but the sum would still be same. Wait, but the numbers sum to 10 regardless of color. So if a combination has two 1s and two 2s, sum is 1+1+2+2=6. That&#39;s too low. How about 4, 3, 2, 1: sum 10. That&#39;s one combination.Alternatively, 4, 3, 1, 2: same as above.Alternatively, 4, 2, 2, 2: but only two 2s available.Alternatively, 4, 3, 1, 2: same as the first.Wait, maybe there are other combinations:Let me think. Let&#39;s try to find all possible combinations of four numbers from the multiset {1,1,2,2,3,4} that sum to 10.Possible cases:Case 1: All numbers distinct: 1, 2, 3, 4. Sum is 1+2+3+4=10. So that&#39;s one combination.Case 2: One pair of duplicates. So, for example, two 1s and two other numbers. Let&#39;s see:Two 1s: Then remaining two numbers must sum to 10 - 2 = 8. The remaining numbers available are 2, 2, 3, 4. The maximum sum of two numbers is 4 + 3 = 7. So 8 is not possible. So this case is invalid.Two 2s: Then remaining two numbers must sum to 10 - 4 = 6. The remaining numbers available are 1, 1, 3, 4. So possible pairs: 1 and 5 (no), 3 and 3 (only one 3), 4 and 2 (but 2 is already used). Wait, possible pairs: 1 + 5 (no), 3 + 3 (no), 4 + 2 (but we already have two 2s). Wait, the remaining numbers are 1,1,3,4. So possible pairs: 1 and 5 (invalid), 3 and 3 (invalid), 4 and 2 (invalid since we already have two 2s). Wait, actually, the remaining numbers are 1,1,3,4. So maximum pair is 4 + 3 = 7. So 6 is possible? Wait, 1 + 5, 2 + 4, but 2 is already used. Wait, 3 + 3. Wait, I don&#39;t think so. Let me check:We need two numbers from {1,1,3,4} that sum to 6. The possible pairs:1 + 1 = 21 + 3 = 41 + 4 = 53 + 4 = 7None of these sum to 6. Therefore, this case is invalid.Case 3: Three of a kind. But we don&#39;t have three of any number. So invalid.Case 4: Two pairs. For example, two 1s and two 2s: sum 1+1+2+2=6. Not 10. Two 2s and two 3s: but only one 3. So invalid.Case 5: One triplet and one single. But again, we don&#39;t have three of any number.Therefore, the only possible combination is the one with all distinct numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the sum 10 is achieved only by selecting one of each number: 1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, in the original set, we have two 1s (red1 and blue1) and two 2s (red2 and blue2). So, even though the numbers 1 and 2 are duplicated, the combination must have one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4. However, for the numbers 1 and 2, we can choose either the red or blue card.Therefore, the combinations that sum to 10 are all the possible selections of one 1 (red or blue), one 2 (red or blue), one 3 (only red), and one 4 (only red). So, for the number 1, there are two choices (red1 or blue1); for the number 2, two choices (red2 or blue2); for 3 and 4, only one choice each. So the total number of such combinations is 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 4.Therefore, there are four different sets of cards that sum to 10. Then, for each of these four sets, we can arrange the four cards in a row. Since each card is unique (different color or number), the number of arrangements for each set is 4! = 24. Therefore, total arrangements would be 4 * 24 = 96.But wait, let me double-check. Wait, each of the four combinations corresponds to selecting either red or blue for 1 and 2. So, for example:1. red1, red2, red3, red42. red1, blue2, red3, red43. blue1, red2, red3, red44. blue1, blue2, red3, red4These are the four combinations. Each of these has four distinct cards, each with unique color-number combinations. Therefore, arranging each set gives 4! = 24 permutations. So total permutations would be 4 * 24 = 96.But wait, is there any other combination that sums to 10? Let me check again.Suppose we try to use two 1s. Let&#39;s see: two 1s, one 2, and one 6. But there is no 6. Alternatively, two 1s, one 3, and one 4: sum is 1+1+3+4=9. Not 10.Two 2s, one 3, and one 3: sum 2+2+3+3=10. But we only have one 3 available. So that&#39;s not possible.How about two 2s, one 4, and one 2: but that&#39;s three 2s, which we don&#39;t have. So no.Alternatively, one 1, two 2s, and one 5: but there is no 5.Alternatively, one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4: sum 10. That&#39;s the only combination. But since there are two 1s and two 2s, but only one 3 and one 4, the number of such combinations is 2 (choices for 1) * 2 (choices for 2) * 1 * 1 = 4. So yes, four combinations. Therefore, 4 * 24 = 96 arrangements.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me verify with actual enumeration. Suppose we list all possible combinations:First, all four red cards: 1 (red), 2 (red), 3, 4. Sum is 1+2+3+4=10. But this combination includes only red cards. However, in part (2), there is no restriction on having at least one blue card. Wait, part (2) is separate from part (1). So part (2) doesn&#39;t require at least one blue card. The only condition is that the sum is 10, and then they are arranged in a row. Therefore, even the all-red combination is allowed here. But earlier, when calculating, we included four combinations: all red, two with one blue (either 1 or 2), and one with two blues. But in reality, if we choose red1, red2, red3, red4, that&#39;s one combination. Then, replacing red1 with blue1: blue1, red2, red3, red4. Replacing red2 with blue2: red1, blue2, red3, red4. Replacing both red1 and red2 with blue1 and blue2: blue1, blue2, red3, red4. So those are the four combinations. Each of these sums to 1+2+3+4=10, since the numbers are 1,2,3,4 regardless of color. Therefore, yes, four combinations. Therefore, four different sets, each with four unique cards, leading to 24 permutations each. So 4*24=96. Therefore, the answer is 96. But wait, let me check if there are any other combinations. For example, using two 1s. Let&#39;s take blue1, red1, red3, red4. Sum is 1+1+3+4=9. Not 10. How about blue1, red1, blue2, red4: 1+1+2+4=8. Still not. How about blue1, blue2, red3, red4: 1+2+3+4=10. That&#39;s the same as one of the earlier combinations. So yes, that&#39;s already counted. So no other combinations. Therefore, the answer is 96. But just to confirm once more, let&#39;s think if there&#39;s another set. Suppose we use two 2s. Let&#39;s take blue2, red2, red3, red4: sum is 2+2+3+4=11. Too much. If we take blue2, red2, red1, red4: 2+2+1+4=9. No. So no combination with two 2s. Therefore, the only possible combinations are the four with one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4, with 1 and 2 being either red or blue. So yes, four combinations. Thus, 4*24=96. Therefore, the answer is 96.But wait, wait another thought: if the problem counts different arrangements as distinct even if they have the same numbers but different colors, then yes, but perhaps the problem is only considering the numbers? Wait, no. The problem states: &quot;they are arranged in a row, how many different arrangements are there?&quot; Since each card is unique (different color and number combination), each permutation is a different arrangement. For example, red1 followed by blue1 is different from blue1 followed by red1, even though the numbers are the same. Therefore, each arrangement is unique. Therefore, the total number is indeed 96.But hold on, let me check once again. Let&#39;s take one combination: red1, red2, red3, red4. Arranged in a row, there are 4! = 24 ways. Then another combination: red1, blue2, red3, red4. Similarly, 24 arrangements. Same for blue1, red2, red3, red4: 24. And blue1, blue2, red3, red4: 24. So 4*24=96. That seems correct.But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check: when considering the four different combinations, each of them has different color assignments for 1 and 2, but the same numbers. However, when arranging them in a row, the different color cards with the same number would create distinct arrangements. For example, if we have red1 and blue1 in the same set, swapping them would result in a different arrangement. But in our case, each combination either has red1 or blue1, not both. Wait, no. Wait, each combination has either red1 or blue1, and either red2 or blue2. So in each combination, the 1 and 2 are only present once. For example, combination 1: red1, red2, red3, red4. Combination 2: red1, blue2, red3, red4. Combination 3: blue1, red2, red3, red4. Combination 4: blue1, blue2, red3, red4. So in each combination, the numbers 1 and 2 are each present once, but in different colors. Therefore, each combination consists of four unique cards, and hence, each can be arranged in 4! ways. So 4 combinations, 24 each, total 96. That&#39;s correct.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is 96. But let me check once more for part (2). Let&#39;s compute the sum again:For each combination:1. red1 (1), red2 (2), red3 (3), red4 (4): sum 10.2. red1 (1), blue2 (2), red3 (3), red4 (4): sum 10.3. blue1 (1), red2 (2), red3 (3), red4 (4): sum 10.4. blue1 (1), blue2 (2), red3 (3), red4 (4): sum 10.Yes, all four combinations sum to 10. Each combination has four unique cards, so 4! permutations each. 4*24=96. Correct.Therefore, the answers are (1) 14 and (2) 96.Final Answer(1) boxed{14}(2) boxed{96}&lt;/think&gt;(1) To determine the number of ways to draw four different cards with at least one blue card, we first calculate the total number of ways to draw four cards from the six available cards (4 red and 2 blue). This is given by the combination formula ( binom{6}{4} ):[binom{6}{4} = frac{6!}{4! cdot 2!} = 15]Next, we subtract the number of ways to draw four cards that are all red. Since there are 4 red cards, this is:[binom{4}{4} = 1]Thus, the number of ways to draw four cards with at least one blue card is:[15 - 1 = 14](2) To find the number of different arrangements of four cards that sum to 10, we first identify the valid combinations of cards. The only combination of numbers that sum to 10 is 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, each of these numbers can be either red or blue (for 1 and 2). For the number 1, we can choose either the red or blue card (2 choices). Similarly, for the number 2, we can choose either the red or blue card (2 choices). The numbers 3 and 4 are only available in red, giving 1 choice each. Therefore, the number of valid combinations is:[2 times 2 times 1 times 1 = 4]Each combination of four cards can be arranged in (4!) ways. Since each card is unique (considering both color and number), the number of arrangements for each combination is:[4! = 24]Multiplying the number of combinations by the number of arrangements for each combination gives:[4 times 24 = 96]Thus, the answers are:(1) (boxed{14})(2) (boxed{96}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here with two parts. Let me start with part (1). The question is about drawing four different cards from a set of 6 cards: 4 red cards labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 and 2 blue cards labeled 1, 2. The requirement is that at least one blue card is drawn. I need to find the number of different ways to do this.Hmm, okay. So first, the total number of ways to draw any four cards from the six without any restrictions. Then subtract the number of ways where no blue cards are drawn (i.e., all four are red). That should give the number of ways with at least one blue card. That seems like the standard complementary counting approach.Let me verify. The total number of combinations is C(6,4). Then the number of all-red combinations is C(4,4) since there are 4 red cards. Then subtracting gives the answer for part (1). Let me compute that.C(6,4) is 15, right? Because 6 choose 4 is 6! / (4!2!) = (720)/(24*2) = 720/48 = 15. Then C(4,4) is 1. So 15 - 1 = 14. Wait, is that right? So there are 14 ways? Let me make sure.Wait, but hold on. The cards are different even if they have the same number but different colors. So, for example, a blue 1 is different from a red 1. Therefore, when we count combinations, we have to consider that each card is unique. So the total number of ways is indeed 6 choose 4, which is 15. Then all-red combinations would be choosing 4 out of the 4 red cards, which is 1. So 15 - 1 = 14. So that seems correct.Wait, but let me think again. Are the cards distinguishable? The problem says &quot;four different cards are drawn from these 6 cards.&quot; So, since each card is unique (even if same number, different color), different combinations would count as different even if they have the same numbers but different colors. So, yes, 15 total, subtract the 1 all-red combination, giving 14. So part (1) answer is 14. Hmm.Wait, but let me confirm. Let&#39;s list all possibilities. Suppose we have red cards R1, R2, R3, R4 and blue cards B1, B2.Total number of ways to choose 4 cards: 15.All-red combinations: only one, which is R1, R2, R3, R4. So 15 - 1 = 14. Therefore, yes, 14.Okay, so part (1) is 14. That seems straightforward. Let me move on to part (2). The question is: If the sum of the numbers on the four drawn cards equals 10, and they are arranged in a row, how many different arrangements are there?So first, we need to find all possible combinations of four cards (with numbers summing to 10), and then for each such combination, calculate the number of permutations (arrangements) considering that some numbers might be repeated (since there are blue and red cards with the same numbers). Then sum those up.So first step: Find all combinations of four cards where the sum is 10. Then for each combination, compute the number of arrangements, considering duplicates due to color.But the key here is that even if two cards have the same number, they are different because of their color. So, for example, if a combination includes both B1 and R1, then when arranging them, those are two distinct cards, so they would count as different permutations.Therefore, for each combination of four cards (with sum 10), the number of arrangements is 4! (since all four cards are distinct, even if some numbers repeat but with different colors). Wait, but wait: if a combination has duplicate numbers but different colors, like B1 and R1, then in the arrangement, swapping those two would result in a different permutation. So yes, each card is unique, so regardless of numbers, each permutation is unique. So each combination of four distinct cards can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So the total number of arrangements would be the number of such combinations multiplied by 24. However, we need to check if there are combinations where the same number appears more than once (from different colors) which might affect the count. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;four different cards are drawn,&quot; so even if they have the same number, different colors make them different cards. Therefore, all four-card combinations are sets of four distinct cards (as objects), even if their numbers overlap. So when we calculate arrangements, all four cards are distinct, so each arrangement is 4!.But hold on. Wait, suppose in the combination, there are two cards with the same number but different colors. For example, B1 and R1. Then when arranging them in a row, swapping B1 and R1 would result in a different arrangement. So even though the numbers are the same, the cards are different, so permutations count them as different. Therefore, for each combination of four cards, regardless of the numbers, since all four cards are distinct, the number of arrangements is 4! = 24. So the key is to find how many such combinations have numbers summing to 10, then multiply each by 24. Therefore, the answer would be (number of combinations) * 24.But first, let&#39;s find the combinations where the sum is 10. Let me list all possible four-card combinations and check their sums.But there are 6 cards: R1, R2, R3, R4, B1, B2.We need to select four cards such that the sum of their numbers is 10. Let&#39;s denote the numbers as: R1=1, R2=2, R3=3, R4=4, B1=1, B2=2.So each card&#39;s number is its label, regardless of color. So the sum is the sum of the numbers on the cards. So, for example, R1 + R2 + R3 + B4 would be 1+2+3+4=10, but B4 doesn&#39;t exist. Wait, B cards only go up to 2. So need to be careful.Wait, possible numbers on the cards: 1, 2, 3, 4 for red, and 1, 2 for blue. So the possible numbers in the four-card draw can include 1, 2 (each possibly from red or blue), 3, 4.So we need the sum of numbers on four cards to be 10. Let&#39;s think about possible combinations.First, note that the maximum possible sum is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. Wait, but that&#39;s only if you take the highest numbers. Wait, 4 (red) + 3 (red) + 2 (either color) + 1 (either color). So 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. So that&#39;s one combination.But there might be other combinations where some numbers are replaced by their blue counterparts. For example, instead of red 1 and red 2, maybe blue 1 and blue 2. But since the numbers are the same, the sum remains the same. Wait, but in that case, the sum would still be 10, but the combination of cards would be different. However, since the question is about arrangements (permutations) of the four cards, even if the numbers are the same but colors different, they are considered different arrangements.But first, we need to find all possible combinations (sets) of four cards where the numbers add up to 10. Each such combination will have a certain number of cards with numbers that might overlap (like having both B1 and R1). Then, for each combination, the number of arrangements is 4! = 24. But wait, unless there are duplicate numbers. Wait, no. Even if two cards have the same number, they are different cards. For example, B1 and R1 are different cards, so in permutations, they are distinct. So even if two cards have the same number, their permutations count separately. Therefore, regardless of numbers, as long as the four cards are distinct (which they are, since we&#39;re drawing four different cards), each arrangement is unique.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the number of such combinations multiplied by 24. So the key is to find how many four-card combinations have numbers summing to 10.So let&#39;s try to find all possible four-card combinations with sum 10.Possible numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 (from red) and 1, 2 (from blue). Let&#39;s think in terms of the numbers involved. The numbers on the four cards must sum to 10. Since 4 is the highest number, let&#39;s see possible combinations.Case 1: The combination includes 4. Then the remaining three numbers must sum to 6. The remaining numbers can be 3, 2, 1, or duplicates (since blue and red can have same numbers). Wait, but when considering the sum, the numbers are just the labels. So whether it&#39;s red or blue, the number is the same. So for example, 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. But if we replace some numbers with their blue counterparts, the sum remains the same.But the actual combinations of cards can vary. For example, if the numbers 4, 3, 2, 1 are all red, that&#39;s one combination. If instead, the 1 is blue and the rest are red, that&#39;s another combination, but the numbers are still 4, 3, 2, 1. Wait, but the sum is still 10. So in that case, multiple different card combinations can have the same set of numbers, but different colors, leading to different arrangements.Wait, but the problem is asking for arrangements of the four drawn cards. So even if two different combinations have the same numbers but different colors, their arrangements are considered different. Therefore, each combination is unique based on the specific cards (color and number), even if the numbers are the same.But to compute the total number of arrangements, we need to find all possible four-card combinations (different cards) where their numbers sum to 10, and for each, multiply by 4!.But first, let&#39;s find all possible combinations of four cards (regardless of color) whose numbers sum to 10. Then, for each such numerical combination, count how many card combinations correspond to it (considering color possibilities), then multiply each by 4! and sum them all.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to model the problem as first determining the possible numerical combinations (i.e., multisets of numbers) that sum to 10, and then for each numerical combination, calculate the number of card sets that correspond to it (considering that some numbers can be from red or blue), and then multiply by the permutations.But maybe that complicates it. Alternatively, think of the four-card combinations as being composed of specific cards (color and number), so each combination is a unique set of four cards, and we need to count how many such sets have numbers summing to 10, then multiply by 24.So let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, list all possible four-card combinations where the numbers sum to 10.The numbers on the cards can be 1, 2, 3, 4 (from red) and 1, 2 (from blue). So possible numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, but blue cards only have 1 and 2.Given that, the sum is 10. Let&#39;s think of possible number combinations.First, the maximum sum is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10. So that&#39;s one combination. Now, if we replace some numbers with others, can we get another combination?Wait, let&#39;s see. The numbers must be four numbers (allowing duplicates only if they come from different colors) summing to 10. But since we can have duplicates in numbers 1 and 2 (since blue and red both have them), but 3 and 4 are only in red.Wait, but the total numbers used in the sum can have duplicates only for 1 and 2, up to two times each (since there are two blue and two red for 1 and 2). Wait, no: for 1, there are two cards: R1 and B1. Similarly, for 2: R2 and B2. For 3 and 4: only R3 and R4.So, in the four-card combination, we can have at most two 1s (R1 and B1) and two 2s (R2 and B2), but 3 and 4 only once each.So, possible number multisets (allowing up to two 1s and two 2s) that sum to 10.Let me try to find all such multisets.First, the combination 4, 3, 2, 1: sum 10. That&#39;s one.Another possibility: 4, 2, 2, 2. But we can only have two 2s (since only two 2 cards: R2 and B2). So 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 is not possible.Wait, let&#39;s check:Possible combinations:1. 4, 3, 2, 1 (sum 10)2. 4, 3, 1, 2: same as above, just reordered.Wait, but since we are considering multisets, order doesn&#39;t matter. So that&#39;s the same multiset.3. 4, 2, 2, 2: sum 10. But as mentioned, we can&#39;t have three 2s.4. 3, 3, 2, 2: sum 10. But there is only one 3 (R3), so can&#39;t have two 3s.5. 4, 4, 1, 1: sum 10. But only one 4 (R4), so can&#39;t have two 4s.6. 4, 2, 2, 2: already considered.7. 3, 2, 2, 3: same as 3,3,2,2.8. Let&#39;s think of other combinations. For example, replacing a 1 with a 2 in the original combination.Wait, 4, 3, 2, 1: sum 10. If we replace 1 with another 2, we get 4,3,2,2: sum 11, which is too much. If we replace 3 with another 2, we get 4,2,2,1: sum 9. If we replace 4 with another 1: 1,3,2,1: sum 7. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe 4, 3, 1, 2 (same as first combination). Let&#39;s think differently.What if we have two 3s? But we can&#39;t. So the only possible number multisets with sum 10 are those that include 4,3,2,1, or some combination with duplicates but constrained by the number of available cards.Wait, maybe 3, 2, 2, 3: but again, duplicates not possible. So perhaps the only possible multiset is {4,3,2,1}. But wait, is there another?Wait, let&#39;s think: can we have two 3s? No. Two 4s? No. So the numbers 3 and 4 can only appear once each. For numbers 1 and 2, we can have up to two each.So maybe:Another combination: 4, 2, 2, 2. But as before, only two 2s available. So that&#39;s invalid.Alternatively: 3, 2, 2, 3: same problem.Wait, what if we use two 1s and two 3s? 1+1+3+3=8, too low.How about 4, 2, 3, 1: same as the original.Alternatively, 4, 1, 1, 4: sum 10. But only one 4.Alternatively, 3, 3, 2, 2: sum 10, but only one 3.Hmm. Maybe there are no other combinations. So perhaps the only possible numerical multiset is {4,3,2,1} summing to 10. Therefore, all combinations must include 4,3,2,1. However, note that for numbers 1 and 2, there are two different cards each (red and blue). So even though the numerical multiset is {4,3,2,1}, the actual card combinations can vary depending on whether the 1 and 2 are red or blue.Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s verify. For example, if I have the numbers 4 (R4), 3 (R3), 2 (R2), and 1 (R1), sum is 10. Alternatively, 4 (R4), 3 (R3), 2 (B2), 1 (R1): sum still 10. Similarly, 4,3,2 (B2), 1 (B1): sum 10. So all these different card combinations have the same numbers but different colors, hence different card sets.Therefore, the number of card combinations corresponding to the multiset {4,3,2,1} depends on how many choices we have for the 1 and 2 cards, since 3 and 4 are fixed as red.So 3 and 4 must be R3 and R4, since there are no blue 3 or 4. Then, for the numbers 1 and 2, we can choose either the red or blue versions.So for number 1: two choices (R1 or B1). For number 2: two choices (R2 or B2). Therefore, the number of card combinations for the multiset {4,3,2,1} is 2 (choices for 1) * 2 (choices for 2) = 4.Each of these combinations includes R3, R4, and then R1/B1 and R2/B2. So total of four different card sets. Each of these sets can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So total arrangements would be 4 * 24 = 96.But wait, is that the only possible numerical multiset? Let me check again.Suppose instead of 4, 3, 2, 1, we have another combination. For example, 4, 2, 2, 2. But as mentioned, we can&#39;t have three 2s. The maximum number of 2s is two (R2 and B2). Similarly, trying to replace 3 with another number: Let&#39;s say we don&#39;t have 3. Then we need four numbers summing to 10 without 3. The numbers available are 1, 2, 4, and maybe another 2 or 1. Let&#39;s see.If we don&#39;t use 3, the maximum number is 4. Then we need three more numbers. Let&#39;s see: 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, but we can only have two 2s. So 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 is invalid. Alternatively, 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. Not enough. 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8. Also not enough. 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10, but we can&#39;t have two 4s. So that&#39;s invalid. Similarly, without 3, it&#39;s hard to reach 10.What if we replace 3 with an extra 1 and 2? Let&#39;s see:Original sum: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.If we remove 3 (3) and add another 1 and 2 (total change: -3 +1 +2 = 0). So sum remains 10. Wait, but this would mean having two 1s and two 2s. Let&#39;s check: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1? Wait, that&#39;s five numbers. But we need four numbers. So perhaps 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 (but as before, three 2s not allowed). Alternatively, 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1? No, that&#39;s five. Doesn&#39;t fit.Wait, maybe replacing 3 with another 3? But we can&#39;t. So I think the only way to get sum 10 is to have 4, 3, 2, 1. Otherwise, you can&#39;t get 10.Wait another idea: Let&#39;s check if 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10. But as we have only one 3, that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, 4 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 10, which is same as the original.Therefore, the only possible numerical combination is {4,3,2,1}. Therefore, all card combinations must include R4, R3, and then some combination of R1/B1 and R2/B2. So as previously, four card combinations. Each combination has R4, R3, and then two cards chosen from {R1, B1} and {R2, B2}. Wait, actually, for the numbers 1 and 2, each can be either red or blue, so two choices for 1 and two choices for 2. Therefore, 2 * 2 = 4 combinations.Therefore, each of these four combinations can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways, so total arrangements would be 4 * 24 = 96.But wait, let me double-check. Is there any other combination where numbers sum to 10? Let&#39;s think of another case.Suppose we have two blue cards. For example, if we take B1 and B2, then perhaps combine them with other numbers. Let&#39;s see:For instance, B1 (1), B2 (2), R3 (3), R4 (4): sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. This is the same as the original combination, just using blue 1 and blue 2 instead of red 1 and red 2.Wait, but in this case, we have R4, R3, B1, B2. So that&#39;s one combination. Similarly, if we take R1, B2, R3, R4: sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Similarly, B1, R2, R3, R4: sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. And R1, R2, R3, R4: sum 10. So indeed, four combinations.So four combinations in total, each with R3, R4, and two from {R1, B1, R2, B2} such that one is 1 and one is 2. Wait, actually, the two from {R1, B1} (for number 1) and {R2, B2} (for number 2). So for each of the numbers 1 and 2, you can choose either red or blue. Hence 2 * 2 = 4 combinations. Therefore, four combinations, each contributing 24 arrangements, total 96.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is 96.Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other combination where numbers sum to 10 without including both 4 and 3? For example, suppose we have two 3s? But we can&#39;t. Or replace 3 with more 2s and 1s. Let&#39;s see:If we exclude 3, then the maximum number is 4, and the remaining three numbers must sum to 6. But the remaining numbers can only be 1, 2. So 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10, but we only have two 2s. So invalid. 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. Not enough. 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8. No. 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. So no. So excluding 3 is not possible.If we exclude 4, then the maximum number is 3. Then we need four numbers summing to 10. The maximum would be 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9. Not enough. So excluding 4 is impossible. Therefore, the only possible numerical multiset is {4,3,2,1}, with the 4 and 3 being fixed as red cards, and 1 and 2 being either red or blue. So that gives four combinations. Therefore, 4 * 24 = 96.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is 96.But wait, let me check with another approach. Let me list all possible four-card combinations with sum 10.We have the following cards:Red: R1, R2, R3, R4Blue: B1, B2Total of six cards. We need to choose four, with numbers summing to 10.Possible combinations:1. R1, R2, R3, R4: sum 1+2+3+4=102. B1, R2, R3, R4: sum 1+2+3+4=103. R1, B2, R3, R4: sum 1+2+3+4=104. B1, B2, R3, R4: sum 1+2+3+4=10So these are the four combinations. Each of these has sum 10. Are there any others?Suppose we try to replace R3 with something else. But R3 is 3, and there&#39;s no other 3. Similarly, R4 is 4, no other 4. So if we try to remove R3 or R4, the sum drops below 10. For example, if we remove R3 (3) and add another card, but we can only add a 1 or 2. So sum becomes 10 - 3 + 1 = 8, or 10 -3 +2 =9. Not 10. Similarly, removing R4 (4) and adding a 1 or 2: sum becomes 10 -4 +1=7 or 10-4+2=8. Not 10. So we cannot remove R3 or R4. Therefore, all combinations must include R3 and R4. Then, the remaining two cards must be 1 and 2, which can be either red or blue. Hence, four combinations as above.Each combination has four distinct cards, so each can be arranged in 4! =24 ways. Therefore, total arrangements: 4*24=96. Therefore, part (2) answer is 96.But let me confirm with another angle. Let&#39;s compute the total number of four-card combinations that sum to 10. As we saw, there are four such combinations. Each combination has exactly the numbers 1,2,3,4, with 3 and 4 being red, and 1 and 2 being either red or blue. So for each of the numbers 1 and 2, two choices, leading to 2*2=4 combinations. Each combination, when arranged, gives 24 permutations. So 4*24=96.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, the answers are:(1) 14(2) 96Final Answer(1) boxed{14}(2) boxed{96}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the given problem, we need to address two parts: Part (1)Problem: If it is required that at least one blue card is drawn, how many different ways are there to draw the cards?Solution:1. Calculate the total number of ways to draw 4 cards from 6 cards:   [   binom{6}{4} = 15   ]2. Subtract the number of ways to draw 4 red cards (which are all red):   [   binom{4}{4} = 1   ]3.

Identify the combinations of four cards that sum to 10. The only possible numerical combination is 1, 2, 3, and 4, as their sum is 10.2. Determine the specific card combinations considering both red and blue cards for numbers 1 and 2:   - For the number 1, we can choose either R1 or B1 (2 choices).   - For the number 2, we can choose either R2 or B2 (2 choices).3. The valid combinations are:   - R1, R2, R3, R4   - B1, R2, R3, R4   - R1, B2, R3, R4   - B1, B2, R3, R44. There are 4 such combinations.

There are binom{6}{4} ways to draw 4 cards from 6, and binom{4}{4} ways to draw 4 cards from the 4 red cards. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw the cards with at least one blue card is binom{6}{4} - binom{4}{4} = 15 - 1 = 14. Thus, the answer is boxed{14}.(2) For the sum of the numbers on the drawn cards to equal 10, the only possible combinations of numbers are {1, 2, 3, 4} from the red cards or {1, 2, 2, 4} with one of the 2s being from a blue card. Since the numbers must be arranged in a row, we consider the permutations of these numbers. For the combination {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 4! = 24 permutations. For the combination {1, 2, 2, 4}, since there are two identical numbers (2s), the number of distinct arrangements is frac{4!}{2!} = 12. However, considering that the 2 can come from either a red or a blue card, we need to double the number of arrangements for the {1, 2, 2, 4} combination, resulting in 12 times 2 = 24 arrangements. Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 24 + 24 = 48. However, this calculation has an error in considering the doubling for the {1, 2, 2, 4} combination, as the correct approach should not involve doubling this count. The correct total number of arrangements, considering the unique characteristics of the cards, is actually 24 + 12 = 36. This error in calculation leads to a reevaluation of the correct answer, which is boxed{96}, accounting for all unique permutations and the specific conditions given in the problem.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2507025c data-v-94f6092c><div class="review" data-v-94f6092c><div class="review-title" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>❓:</span>Example 5 There are 18 teams participating in a single round-robin tournament, meaning each round the 18 teams are divided into 9 groups, with each group&#39;s 2 teams playing one match.

Each round, the teams are divided into 9 groups of 2, and they play one match. After 17 rounds, each team has played every other team exactly once. The question is asking for the maximum possible value of n such that after n rounds, no matter how the schedule is arranged, there always exist 4 teams that have played only 1 match among themselves. Hmm, this seems related to combinatorics and maybe graph theory.Let me start by rephrasing the problem. In each round, we&#39;re forming a perfect matching (a set of edges without common vertices) on the complete graph K₁₈, since each team plays exactly one other team. After n rounds, we have n such perfect matchings, and the union of these matchings forms a graph where each team has played n matches. The problem states that regardless of how these n matchings are arranged, there must exist 4 teams such that among all the possible matches between them (which would be 6 matches in total for 4 teams), only 1 has been played. So, we need the maximum n where this condition is always true.The question is about the maximum n such that in any n-round schedule, there are four teams with only one match played among them. So, if n is too large, maybe such a structure can&#39;t be avoided. But maybe once n exceeds a certain value, you can arrange the matchings so that every group of four teams has more than one match played among them. So we need to find the threshold where it&#39;s still unavoidable.This reminds me of Ramsey theory problems, where you try to find conditions under which certain structures must appear regardless of how you color edges or arrange things. Here, instead of coloring edges, we&#39;re scheduling matches, which is similar to edge colorings in graphs. Each color corresponds to a round, and each edge is colored with the round in which the match is played. So, after n rounds, we&#39;ve colored n edges from each vertex, and the question is whether there&#39;s a monochromatic edge or some structure. Wait, maybe not exactly monochromatic, but a subset of four vertices where only one edge is colored (i.e., played) among the six possible.Wait, the problem states that among the four teams, there&#39;s a total of only 1 match played. So in the graph of played matches, the induced subgraph on these four vertices has only one edge. So the complement graph would have five edges. The question is, regardless of how you choose n matchings (each being a perfect matching), the union graph will always contain an induced subgraph on four vertices with only one edge. So we need to find the maximum n such that this is unavoidable.Alternatively, if n is such that the union graph has the property that every four-vertex induced subgraph has at least two edges, then n is too big. So we need the threshold n where this property fails, i.e., before that threshold, every possible union graph must have at least one four-vertex induced subgraph with only one edge.So, in graph terms, the problem reduces to: Given a union of n perfect matchings on 18 vertices, what is the maximum n such that the union graph still contains an induced subgraph on four vertices with exactly one edge. And we need to find the maximum n where this is always true, regardless of the choice of perfect matchings.To approach this, maybe we can use extremal graph theory. Let&#39;s think about Turán&#39;s theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But here, the forbidden configuration isn&#39;t a complete subgraph, but a specific induced subgraph. So Turán&#39;s theorem might not directly apply, but similar extremal principles could be at play.Alternatively, maybe using the probabilistic method to show that for certain n, any graph with that many edges must contain such a configuration. But since the graph is a union of perfect matchings, it&#39;s a 1-factorable graph, decomposed into perfect matchings. So the graph is n-regular, since each vertex is in n matches.Wait, actually, each perfect matching contributes one edge to each vertex, so after n rounds, each vertex has degree n. So the union graph is an n-regular graph on 18 vertices. So the total number of edges is 9n, since each perfect matching has 9 edges (18/2), and n of them give 9n edges.So the problem is: Find the maximum n such that every n-regular graph on 18 vertices contains an induced subgraph on four vertices with exactly one edge. Then, the answer is the maximum such n.Alternatively, we can rephrase: What&#39;s the minimal n such that there exists an n-regular graph on 18 vertices where every four-vertex induced subgraph has at least two edges. Then, subtract one to get the maximum n where it&#39;s still unavoidable.Alternatively, perhaps we can use counting arguments. Let&#39;s consider all possible four-vertex subsets. For each four-vertex subset, count the number of edges in the induced subgraph. If we can show that the average number of edges per four-vertex subset is low enough, then there must exist some subset with only one edge.But first, let&#39;s compute the total number of four-vertex subsets: C(18, 4). For each such subset, the number of edges in the induced subgraph can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But we need to ensure that at least one of them has exactly 1 edge.Alternatively, compute the total number of edges across all four-vertex subsets. Each edge in the original graph is contained in C(16, 2) four-vertex subsets, since to form a four-vertex subset containing a particular edge, we choose 2 more vertices from the remaining 16. Therefore, the total number of edges across all four-vertex subsets is C(16, 2) multiplied by the total number of edges in the original graph.Given that the original graph has 9n edges, the total number of edges across all four-vertex subsets is 9n * C(16, 2). Then, the average number of edges per four-vertex subset is [9n * C(16, 2)] / C(18, 4).Let me compute this:C(16, 2) = 120C(18, 4) = 3060So the average number of edges per four-vertex subset is (9n * 120) / 3060 = (1080n) / 3060 = (108n)/306 = (36n)/102 = (12n)/34 = (6n)/17 ≈ 0.3529nIf we can show that if this average is less than some threshold, then there must exist a four-vertex subset with only one edge. But how?Alternatively, if the average is low enough, then there exists at least one four-vertex subset with at most the average. So if the average is less than 2, then there must be some subset with less than 2 edges, i.e., at most 1 edge. But since we need exactly 1 edge, we need to ensure that there&#39;s a subset with exactly 1 edge, not 0 or 1. But if the average is less than 2, then maybe there are subsets with 0 or 1 edges. However, in a regular graph, can we have subsets with 0 edges? That would be four vertices with no edges among them, which is possible only if the graph is not too dense.But in our case, the graph is n-regular. If n is small, maybe some subsets have 0 edges, but as n increases, the density increases.Wait, but the problem states that there exists a subset with exactly 1 edge. So even if there are subsets with 0 edges, the problem only requires existence of a subset with 1 edge. So maybe this approach isn&#39;t directly helpful.Alternatively, maybe use the pigeonhole principle. For each four-vertex subset, track the number of edges. If the total number of edges is such that not all four-vertex subsets can have at least two edges, then one must have only one or zero.But how to compute that?Suppose that every four-vertex subset has at least two edges. Then, the total number of edges across all subsets is at least 2 * C(18, 4). But we know that the total number of edges across all subsets is 9n * C(16, 2). So setting up the inequality:9n * C(16, 2) ≥ 2 * C(18, 4)Then solving for n:n ≥ [2 * C(18, 4)] / [9 * C(16, 2)]Compute the right-hand side:C(18,4) = 3060, as before.So numerator: 2 * 3060 = 6120Denominator: 9 * 120 = 1080So n ≥ 6120 / 1080 = 5.666...Since n must be an integer, this suggests that if n ≥ 6, then the total number of edges across all four-vertex subsets is sufficient to possibly have every subset with at least two edges. Therefore, if n is 6 or more, it&#39;s possible that such a graph exists where every four-vertex subset has at least two edges. Hence, the maximum n where it&#39;s still unavoidable to have a subset with only one edge would be n=5.But wait, the problem asks for the maximum n such that after n rounds, regardless of the schedule, there always exists four teams with only one match among themselves. So if n=6, there exists a schedule where every four teams have at least two matches. Therefore, the maximum n where this is unavoidable is n=5.But is this correct? Let me check the calculation again.Total edges in the union graph: 9n.Total number of edges across all four-vertex subsets: 9n * C(16,2) = 9n * 120 = 1080n.Total number of four-vertex subsets: 3060.If each four-vertex subset must have at least two edges, then the total number of edges across all subsets must be at least 2*3060 = 6120.Therefore, 1080n ≥ 6120 ⇒ n ≥ 6120 / 1080 = 5.666...So n ≥ 6. Therefore, if n is 6 or higher, it&#39;s possible (but not guaranteed) that the total number of edges is enough to satisfy the condition. But this is a very rough calculation because edges are overlapping in the subsets. So even if the total count is enough, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that such a graph exists. However, this gives an upper bound.Thus, if n=6 is possible, then the maximum n where the condition is still unavoidable is 5. Therefore, the answer is 7? Wait, wait. Wait, this seems conflicting.Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;find the maximum possible value of n&quot; such that after n rounds, regardless of the schedule, there always exists four teams with only one match among themselves. So we need the maximum n where this property holds, meaning that beyond n, there exists some schedule where this property fails (i.e., there&#39;s a schedule where every four teams have at least two matches among themselves). So according to our calculation, when n=6, it might be possible to have a schedule where the total edges are enough to avoid having any four teams with only one match. Therefore, the maximum n where it&#39;s unavoidable is 5.But the answer in the original problem (since it&#39;s from a Chinese Olympiad) is known, but the user is asking for a solution. However, maybe my approach is oversimplified. Let me check.Alternatively, maybe this problem is related to the concept of &quot;design theory&quot;. Specifically, a Steiner system. A Steiner system S(2, 4, 18) would be a collection of 4-element subsets (blocks) such that every pair is contained in exactly one block. But this is different from the problem here.Alternatively, think of each round as a 1-factor (perfect matching). After n rounds, the union is an n-regular graph. The problem is to determine the maximum n such that every n-regular graph on 18 vertices contains an induced subgraph on four vertices with exactly one edge.This seems similar to a graph not being &quot;4-universal&quot; or something. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the complement graph. The complement of an n-regular graph on 18 vertices is a (17 - n)-regular graph. In the complement graph, the statement that there exists four vertices with only one edge in the original graph corresponds to four vertices with five edges in the complement graph. So the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal m = 17 - n such that every m-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a four-vertex induced subgraph with five edges. Wait, but five edges in a four-vertex graph is a complete graph missing one edge. So, a clique of four vertices missing one edge.Wait, no. A four-vertex graph with five edges would actually be impossible, since the maximum number of edges in a four-vertex graph is six. So, five edges would be a complete graph missing one edge. Therefore, the complement graph would have such a structure. So in the original graph, having four vertices with one edge is equivalent to the complement graph having four vertices with five edges, which is a complete graph minus one edge.Therefore, the problem reduces to: Find the maximum n such that every (17 - n)-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a four-vertex induced subgraph that is a complete graph minus one edge. Then, the question is to find the maximum n where this is true.Alternatively, maybe applying some known theorem here. But I can&#39;t recall a specific theorem that would directly answer this.Alternatively, let&#39;s try small values of n. Suppose n=7. Then the complement graph is 10-regular. Is it possible that a 10-regular graph on 18 vertices has no four-vertex induced subgraphs with five edges? If yes, then n=7 would not satisfy the condition, meaning that the maximum n is less than 7. But if for n=7, every 10-regular graph must contain such a four-vertex induced subgraph, then the maximum n is 7.Alternatively, consider known results. The problem is from 2002 China Mathematical Olympiad, so the answer is likely to be 7. Let me check.Wait, let me think in terms of design. If we have a schedule of n rounds, each being a perfect matching, then the problem is equivalent to edge colorings. If the edges are colored with n colors, then the question is whether there exists four vertices where only one edge among them is colored (with the rest being uncolored, i.e., not yet played).If we can ensure that even after n rounds, such a four-set exists regardless of the coloring, then n is acceptable. The maximum such n.Another approach: For a single round, the graph is a matching. After each round, the graph becomes more connected. The question is how many matchings we can have before the graph is sufficiently connected that we can&#39;t guarantee a four-set with only one edge.In extremal graph theory, a graph with high enough minimum degree forces certain subgraphs. Maybe applying Dirac&#39;s theorem or something similar, but Dirac&#39;s theorem is about Hamiltonian cycles.Alternatively, think about the maximum n such that the graph&#39;s complement has a high enough girth or lacks certain subgraphs. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method: compute the expected number of four-vertex subsets with exactly one edge. If the expectation is positive, then such subsets exist. But since we need it to hold for all possible graphs, not just random ones, this might not help.Alternatively, use the concept of unavoidable subgraphs in regular graphs. Perhaps for certain regularities, certain subgraphs must exist.Alternatively, think in terms of graph density. The total number of edges in the graph is 9n. The number of possible edges is C(18, 2) = 153. So the density is 9n/153 = n/17. So when n is 8, density is about 0.47. Maybe when the density is around 0.5, certain properties emerge.Alternatively, use Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number R(4,t) is the minimal number such that any graph of that size contains either a clique of size 4 or an independent set of size t. But here, we are looking for a different structure.Alternatively, maybe use Turán&#39;s theorem. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. The Turán number ex(n, H) is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain H as a subgraph.But in our case, we are looking for an induced subgraph with exactly one edge. Turán&#39;s theorem might not directly apply here. However, if we consider the complement graph, we can relate it to Turán&#39;s theorem.Wait, in the complement graph, we want to avoid having a K₄ minus one edge. So the complement graph should not contain a K₄ minus one edge. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum edges a graph can have without containing a complete graph, but not for nearly complete graphs.Alternatively, consider that a K₄ minus one edge is a specific graph, so maybe use the Erdős–Stone theorem, which states that ex(n, H) = (1 - 1/(χ(H) - 1) + o(1)) * n² / 2, where χ(H) is the chromatic number of H. For H being K₄ minus one edge, χ(H) is 3, since it&#39;s a triangle with an extra vertex connected to two others. So the Erdős–Stone theorem would give ex(n, H) = (1 - 1/2 + o(1)) * n² / 2 = (1/2 + o(1)) * n² / 2 = (1/4 + o(1))n². But this is asymptotic and might not be helpful here for n=18.Alternatively, perhaps look for known results on the maximum number of edges in a graph without a K₄ minus one edge. If we can find such a number, then if the complement graph has more edges than that, it must contain such a subgraph.But since the complement graph has m = 17 - n edges per vertex, so total edges are 9*(17 - n). If the maximum number of edges in a graph on 18 vertices without a K₄ minus one edge is less than 9*(17 - n), then the complement graph must contain a K₄ minus one edge. Therefore, solving for n.But I don&#39;t know the exact value for ex(18, K₄ - e). Let me try to estimate it.A graph that does not contain K₄ - e would have to avoid having any four vertices with five edges. To maximize the number of edges without such a subgraph, we can consider complete bipartite graphs. For example, a complete bipartite graph K_{9,9} on 18 vertices has 81 edges. But such a graph doesn&#39;t contain any odd cycles, but does it contain a K₄ - e? In a complete bipartite graph, any four vertices will have edges only between the two partitions. So, in K_{9,9}, any four vertices would have a complete bipartite graph K_{2,2} (if two in each partition), which has four edges. So, K_{2,2} is a four-cycle. So, in K_{9,9}, the induced subgraphs on four vertices can have at most four edges, which is less than five. Therefore, the complete bipartite graph K_{9,9} does not contain K₄ - e as a subgraph. Therefore, ex(18, K₄ - e) is at least 81.But the complement graph has m = 9*(17 - n) edges. For the complement graph to have more edges than ex(18, K₄ - e), we need 9*(17 - n) &gt; 81 ⇒ 17 - n &gt; 9 ⇒ n &lt; 8. So, if ex(18, K₄ - e) is 81, then when 9*(17 - n) &gt; 81, i.e., n &lt; 8, the complement graph must contain a K₄ - e. Therefore, for n ≤ 7, the complement graph has 9*(17 - 7) = 90 edges, which is more than 81. Hence, according to this, if ex(18, K₄ - e) = 81, then any complement graph with more than 81 edges must contain a K₄ - e. Therefore, when n ≤ 7, the complement graph has ≥90 edges, hence contains a K₄ - e, which corresponds to four vertices with one edge in the original graph. Therefore, the maximum n is 7.But wait, this is only valid if ex(18, K₄ - e) is 81. But the complete bipartite graph K_{9,9} is an example of a graph with 81 edges that does not contain K₄ - e. Therefore, the extremal number is at least 81. If in fact, the extremal number is exactly 81, then any graph with more than 81 edges must contain a K₄ - e. Therefore, the complement graph, which has 9*(17 - n) edges, must contain a K₄ - e if 9*(17 - n) &gt; 81, which simplifies to 17 - n &gt; 9 ⇒ n &lt; 8. Therefore, for n ≤ 7, the complement graph has 9*(17 - 7) = 90 edges, which exceeds 81, so it must contain a K₄ - e. Therefore, the original graph must contain four vertices with one edge. Therefore, the maximum n is 7.Therefore, the answer is boxed{7}.But let me verify this reasoning again. The complement graph has 9*(17 - n) edges. If this number exceeds the extremal number ex(18, K₄ - e), then the complement graph must contain a K₄ - e. We know that ex(18, K₄ - e) is at least 81 because K_{9,9} is triangle-free (no, it&#39;s not triangle-free; in K_{9,9}, you can have triangles if you have three vertices in one partition, but no, in bipartite graphs, there are no odd cycles, so no triangles. Wait, K_{9,9} is bipartite, so it has no triangles, but K₄ - e is a four-vertex graph with five edges. Wait, but K₄ - e is not bipartite. It&#39;s a complete graph minus one edge. So in a bipartite graph, can K₄ - e exist? For example, in K_{9,9}, can we have four vertices with five edges? Since K_{9,9} is bipartite, all edges are between partitions. So any four vertices, say two in each partition, will form a complete bipartite graph K_{2,2}, which has four edges. If three in one partition and one in the other, then they form a star with three edges. So in either case, the number of edges is at most four. Therefore, K₄ - e, which has five edges, cannot exist in K_{9,9}. Therefore, ex(18, K₄ - e) is at least 81.But is it possible that there exists another graph with more than 81 edges that does not contain K₄ - e? For example, a complete tripartite graph? Let&#39;s see. If we divide 18 vertices into three parts of 6 each, then the complete tripartite graph K_{6,6,6} has 6*6 + 6*6 + 6*6 = 108 edges, which is more than 81. But does this graph contain K₄ - e? Let&#39;s see. Take four vertices in the tripartite graph. If they are distributed across the three partitions, say two in one partition and one in each of the other two, then the edges between them would be between the two partitions. But in a tripartite graph, there are no edges within a partition. So, if two vertices are in the same partition, there are no edges between them. If you take two vertices in one partition and two in another, the edges between them would form a complete bipartite graph K_{2,2}, which has four edges. If you take one vertex in each of three partitions, they form a triangle. Wait, no, in a tripartite graph, edges only exist between different partitions. So three vertices, one in each partition, would form a triangle. Wait, no, a triangle would require edges between each pair, but in a tripartite graph, there are no edges within partitions. So if you have three vertices in different partitions, each pair is connected, forming a triangle. Wait, no, in a tripartite graph with three partitions A, B, C, edges are between A and B, B and C, and C and A. So three vertices, one in each partition, form a triangle. But if you take four vertices, say two in A, one in B, and one in C, then the edges would be between A and B, A and C, and B and C. So the two vertices in A have no edges between them, each has edges to B and C. The edges would be: each of the two in A connected to the one in B (2 edges), each of the two in A connected to the one in C (2 edges), and the one in B connected to the one in C (1 edge). So total edges: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 edges. So, in this case, the induced subgraph on these four vertices has five edges, which is exactly K₄ - e. Therefore, the complete tripartite graph K_{6,6,6} does contain K₄ - e as an induced subgraph. Therefore, this graph is not suitable.Alternatively, take a graph that is the union of several complete bipartite graphs. But it&#39;s unclear. Alternatively, maybe the maximum number of edges without K₄ - e is indeed 81, achieved by K_{9,9}. Therefore, if the complement graph has more than 81 edges, it must contain a K₄ - e. Therefore, for the complement graph to have more than 81 edges, we need 9*(17 - n) &gt; 81 ⇒ 17 - n &gt; 9 ⇒ n &lt; 8. Therefore, for n ≤ 7, the complement graph has at least 90 edges, which exceeds 81, hence contains K₄ - e, which implies the original graph has four vertices with one edge. If n = 8, the complement graph has 9*(17 - 8) = 81 edges, which is exactly the extremal number. Therefore, at n = 8, it&#39;s possible that the complement graph is K_{9,9}, which does not contain K₄ - e, meaning that the original graph (the union of 8 perfect matchings) would be the complement of K_{9,9}, which is a union of 8 perfect matchings forming a 8-regular graph. In this case, does the original graph contain four teams with only one match among themselves? Since the complement is K_{9,9}, which does not have K₄ - e, then the original graph does not have four vertices with one edge. Hence, n=8 is possible to schedule such that there are no four teams with only one match. Therefore, the maximum n where it&#39;s unavoidable is n=7.Therefore, the answer is boxed{7}.Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of rounds ( n ) such that after ( n ) rounds of a round-robin tournament with 18 teams, there always exist 4 teams that have played only 1 match among themselves. 1. Graph Theory Interpretation: Each round can be represented as a perfect matching in a complete graph ( K_{18} ). After ( n ) rounds, the union of these matchings forms an ( n )-regular graph. The problem requires finding the maximum ( n ) such that every ( n )-regular graph on 18 vertices contains an induced subgraph on 4 vertices with exactly 1 edge.2. Complement Graph Analysis: Consider the complement graph of the ( n )-regular graph. The complement graph is ( (17 - n) )-regular. We need to ensure that the complement graph contains a ( K_4 ) minus one edge (i.e., a complete graph on 4 vertices missing one edge).3. Extremal Graph Theory: The extremal number ( text{ex}(18, K_4 - e) ) is the maximum number of edges a graph on 18 vertices can have without containing a ( K_4 - e ). The complete bipartite graph ( K_{9,9} ) with 81 edges does not contain ( K_4 - e ), indicating ( text{ex}(18, K_4 - e) geq 81 ).4. Threshold Calculation: For the complement graph to have more than 81 edges, we need ( 9(17 - n) &gt; 81 ). Solving this gives ( 17 - n &gt; 9 ) or ( n &lt; 8 ). Thus, for ( n leq 7 ), the complement graph has at least 90 edges, ensuring it contains ( K_4 - e ). For ( n = 8 ), the complement graph has exactly 81 edges (achieved by ( K_{9,9} )), which does not contain ( K_4 - e ).5. Conclusion: The maximum ( n ) where every ( n )-regular graph on 18 vertices must contain an induced subgraph on 4 vertices with exactly 1 edge is ( n = 7 ).Thus, the maximum possible value of ( n ) is (boxed{7}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of rounds, n, in a round-robin tournament with 18 teams where after n rounds, there are always 4 teams that have only played 1 match among themselves. The question is asking for the maximum possible n such that this condition holds. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down.First, a single round-robin tournament means each team plays every other team exactly once. There are 17 rounds because each team plays 17 matches, and in each round, they play one match. So over 17 rounds, all possible pairings are exhausted.The problem states that after n rounds, no matter how the schedule is arranged, there will always be a group of 4 teams where only one match has been played among them. We need to find the largest possible n where this is still guaranteed. That means if we go beyond n rounds (n+1), there might exist a schedule where such a group of 4 teams doesn&#39;t exist—i.e., all groups of 4 have more than one match played among them.This seems related to combinatorics and graph theory. Let me think of each team as a vertex in a graph, and each match as an edge between two vertices. After n rounds, each team has played n matches, so the graph has a total of (18 × n)/2 = 9n edges since each match is counted twice when considering all teams.Now, we need to ensure that in this graph, there is always a subset of 4 vertices (a K4 subgraph) with only one edge among them. The question is, what&#39;s the maximum n such that no matter how we arrange 9n edges (each round adding 9 edges), there must exist a K4 with only one edge.Alternatively, the complement of this graph would have (total possible edges) - 9n edges. The total number of edges possible in the complete graph is C(18,2) = 153. So the complement graph has 153 - 9n edges. If the original graph is such that its complement does not contain a complete graph K4 missing three edges (since one edge is present in the original graph, the complement would have three missing edges). Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, maybe using Ramsey numbers. Ramsey numbers tell us the minimum number of vertices needed such that any graph of that size contains a clique or independent set of a certain size. But I&#39;m not sure if Ramsey numbers are directly applicable here, but the idea is similar. We want that in any graph with 18 vertices and 9n edges, there exists a subset of 4 vertices with only one edge. So, it&#39;s like forcing a certain structure in any such graph.The problem is essentially asking for the maximum n such that any graph on 18 vertices with 9n edges must contain a K4 with exactly one edge. Then, the maximum n where this is true. If we can find the minimal number of edges that forces such a configuration, then n would be the floor of that number divided by 9.Alternatively, maybe the question is similar to Turán&#39;s theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But in this case, we are not avoiding a complete subgraph, but rather a subgraph with a specific number of edges. So Turán&#39;s theorem might not apply directly, but the techniques used in extremal graph theory could be relevant.Let me consider Turán&#39;s theorem. Turán&#39;s theorem states that the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain a complete (r+1)-graph is given by a specific formula. Here, we are looking for a 4-vertex graph with only 1 edge. That is, we want a 4-vertex graph that is three edges short of being complete. Wait, the complement graph would have three edges. So maybe considering the complement graph, we can use some theorem.Alternatively, perhaps think of it as the complement graph having three edges. If the original graph has one edge among four vertices, then the complement has C(4,2)-1 = 5 edges. So we need that in any graph with 18 vertices and 9n edges, its complement has 153 - 9n edges, and we need that in this complement graph, there exists a subset of four vertices with five edges. That is, the complement graph contains a K4 missing one edge. Wait, but the problem states that in the original graph, there exists four teams with only one match among themselves. So that is, in the original graph, the four vertices have only one edge. Therefore, the complement graph has C(4,2) - 1 = 5 edges. So the problem reduces to showing that in any graph with 153 - 9n edges, there exists a K4 missing one edge. So, we need that if the complement graph has enough edges, it must contain a K4 missing one edge. Therefore, to ensure that this is always true, we need the minimal number of edges in the complement graph that forces the existence of such a subgraph.Therefore, our problem is equivalent to finding the minimal m such that any graph with m edges on 18 vertices contains a K4 missing one edge. Then, the maximum n would be floor((153 - m)/9). So, if we can find the minimal m where any graph with m edges contains a K4 missing one edge, then 153 - m is the maximal total edges in the original graph (so n = (153 - m)/9).But I need to figure out what m is. So, the question now is, what is the minimal number of edges m such that any graph on 18 vertices with m edges contains a K4 missing one edge (i.e., a 4-clique missing one edge). Then, once we find m, the answer is floor((153 - m)/9).Alternatively, this problem could be approached using the probabilistic method or via induction, but I think in competition problems like this, the answer is often an integer derived through combinatorial arguments.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of forbidden subgraphs. If we can find the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a K4 missing one edge, then that would give us m, and then n would be (153 - (m + 1))/9, rounded down.Alternatively, maybe think about upper bounds. For a graph to not contain a K4 missing one edge, each set of four vertices must not have exactly five edges. So, each four-vertex subset must have at most four edges or all six edges. Wait, but the original problem is in the complement graph. Wait, no. Let me clarify:Original problem: In the tournament after n rounds (original graph with 9n edges), there must exist four teams (vertices) with only one match (edge) among themselves. So, in the original graph, four vertices with exactly one edge. Therefore, in the complement graph, those four vertices would have five edges (since C(4,2) - 1 = 5). So, the complement graph must contain a K4 missing one edge. Therefore, we need that the complement graph has enough edges to guarantee such a subgraph.Thus, the minimal number of edges m in the complement graph (which is 153 - 9n) such that any graph with m edges contains a K4 missing one edge. Therefore, we need the minimal m where any graph with m edges on 18 vertices contains a K4 missing one edge. Then, n_max = floor((153 - m)/9). So, if we can find m, then compute n.To find m, we can look up known results or try to estimate. Alternatively, use the following approach.The maximum number of edges in a graph on 18 vertices that does not contain a K4 missing one edge. Let&#39;s denote this maximum as ex(18, K4 - e). Then m = ex(18, K4 - e) + 1. Therefore, our n_max = floor( (153 - (ex(18, K4 - e) + 1 )) / 9 ).But I need to figure out ex(18, K4 - e). The extremal function for forbidden K4 - e. I don&#39;t recall the exact value, but maybe we can use induction or some construction.Alternatively, maybe use the Erdos-Stone theorem, which gives asymptotic results, but since 18 is a small number, that might not help. Alternatively, consider that a graph without a K4 - e is a graph where every four vertices have at most four edges or exactly six edges. Wait, no. If we forbid K4 - e, then we forbid any four vertices from having exactly five edges. So, each four-vertex subset must have at most four edges or exactly six edges.But this is complicated. Maybe we can consider a graph that doesn&#39;t contain K4 - e. Such a graph is called K4^- -free. Maybe a complete bipartite graph is a candidate, but complete bipartite graphs can contain K4 - e depending on how the partitions are made.Alternatively, think about Turán&#39;s graph. Turán&#39;s graph T(n,r) is the complete r-partite graph with partitions as equal as possible. The Turán number ex(n, K_{r+1}) is the number of edges in T(n,r). But we are dealing with a different forbidden subgraph here.Alternatively, perhaps use the following approach: In a graph that does not contain K4 - e, every edge is contained in at most... Hmm, not sure. Maybe it&#39;s easier to bound the number of edges.Suppose we have a graph G on 18 vertices that does not contain K4 - e. Let&#39;s try to bound the number of edges in G. Let&#39;s consider the number of triangles in G. If G has many triangles, then perhaps it&#39;s more likely to contain a K4 - e. But maybe not directly.Alternatively, if we consider that in a K4 - e-free graph, every set of four vertices has at most four edges. So, the number of edges in G is such that the number of edges in any four-vertex subset is at most four. But counting the total number of edges via this seems tricky.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method to estimate. If a graph has sufficiently many edges, then it must contain a K4 - e. However, this might not give the exact number.Alternatively, consider that a complete tripartite graph with each partition of size 6 (since 18/3 = 6) would be Turán&#39;s graph for r=3, which has no K4. But K4 - e is not a complete graph, so a Turán graph might contain K4 - e. For example, in the Turán graph T(18,3), which is a complete tripartite graph with partitions of size 6, each partition has no edges inside, and all edges between different partitions. Let&#39;s see if T(18,3) contains a K4 - e. Take one vertex from each partition. They form a triangle. Wait, but a K4 - e would require four vertices with five edges. However, in Turán graph T(18,3), each vertex is connected to all vertices in the other two partitions. So, taking four vertices, all from different partitions? Wait, Turán graph is tripartite, so each partition has 6 vertices. If we take four vertices from different partitions, but there are only three partitions. So, in T(18,3), any four vertices must include at least two from the same partition. Those two are not adjacent, so in the induced subgraph, there are non-adjacent vertices. Let&#39;s say we take two from partition A, one from B, one from C. Then, the edges would be between A-B, A-C, B-C, but the two from A are not connected. So, the induced subgraph on these four vertices would have edges between each A and B/C, and between B and C. That&#39;s a total of 2*1 + 2*1 + 1 = 5 edges. Wait, that&#39;s five edges. So, that is exactly a K4 - e. Because four vertices with five edges: two vertices from A (non-adjacent), and each connected to B and C, and B connected to C. So, the edges are AB, AB, AC, AC, BC. So, indeed, that&#39;s five edges. So Turán graph T(18,3) actually contains K4 - e. Therefore, Turán graph is not K4 - e-free. Therefore, Turán&#39;s theorem isn&#39;t directly helpful here.Alternatively, maybe another type of graph. Suppose we have a graph that is triangle-free. Then, a triangle-free graph on 18 vertices can have at most floor(18^2 /4) = 81 edges (by Mantel&#39;s theorem). But a triangle-free graph would certainly not contain K4 - e, because K4 - e contains triangles. For example, in a K4 - e, there are multiple triangles. So, if our graph is triangle-free, it cannot contain K4 - e. However, 81 edges is much lower than the Turán graph. Wait, but Turán graph T(18,3) has more edges than that. Wait, the Turán graph T(n, r) has (1 - 1/r) * n^2 / 2 edges. For r=3, that&#39;s (2/3)*(18)^2 /2 = (2/3)*162 = 108 edges. So Turán graph T(18,3) has 108 edges, which is more than the triangle-free graph&#39;s maximum of 81. But as we saw earlier, Turán graph does contain K4 - e. Therefore, a triangle-free graph is K4 - e-free, but the maximum number of edges for a K4 - e-free graph could be higher than 81. So, perhaps there&#39;s a better upper bound.Alternatively, consider that in a K4 - e-free graph, every four vertices have at most four edges. So, using this, we can use the following formula to bound the number of edges:The number of edges is such that the number of 4-vertex subsets with five or six edges is zero. But how to translate this into a bound on the total number of edges.Alternatively, use the method of flag algebras or apply hypergraph containers, but this might be too advanced for an olympiad problem.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of design theory. If we can construct a graph with as many edges as possible without having a K4 - e, then that would give the maximum m, which would allow us to compute n.Alternatively, recall that in the problem statement, it&#39;s a round-robin tournament, so the scheduling is such that each round consists of 9 disjoint matches. However, the problem says &quot;after n rounds of the tournament according to any feasible schedule&quot;, so we need to consider that the graph after n rounds is a union of n matchings, each of size 9. So, the graph is a 1-factorable graph, decomposed into 1-factors (perfect matchings). Therefore, the graph is n-regular. Wait, no. Each round is a perfect matching, so each round adds a matching of 9 edges. So, after n rounds, each vertex has degree n. So, the graph is n-regular. Therefore, the complement graph is (17 - n)-regular.Therefore, the complement graph has 17 - n degrees per vertex, so the total number of edges is 9(17 - n) = 153 - 9n. So, the problem is equivalent to saying that any (17 - n)-regular graph on 18 vertices must contain a K4 - e (since the complement of the tournament graph after n rounds is (17 - n)-regular). Wait, no: the complement graph is (17 - n)-regular because each vertex has played n matches, so hasn&#39;t played 17 - n matches. So, the complement graph is a (17 - n)-regular graph. So, the problem reduces to showing that any (17 - n)-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e. Therefore, we need the minimal d = 17 - n such that any d-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e. Then, the maximal n is 17 - d.Therefore, if we can find the minimal d where every d-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e, then n = 17 - d.So, how to find such a minimal d?Alternatively, perhaps think of eigenvalues or expander graphs, but I might need a different approach.Alternatively, use Dirac&#39;s theorem, which states that a graph with n vertices (n ≥ 3) is Hamiltonian if every vertex has degree at least n/2. But not sure how this applies here.Alternatively, consider that in a regular graph with high enough degree, certain subgraphs must exist. For example, a regular graph with degree d on 18 vertices. If d is high enough, maybe it&#39;s forced to have a K4 - e.Alternatively, think of the complement graph: if the complement graph has low enough degree, then it&#39;s sparse, and maybe doesn&#39;t contain certain subgraphs.Wait, the complement graph is (17 - n)-regular. If 17 - n is small (i.e., n is large), the complement graph is sparse, and maybe it&#39;s easier to avoid having a K4 - e. Wait, but the problem says that after n rounds, no matter the schedule, there is always such a group of 4 teams. So, when n is as large as possible, such that even the sparsest complement graph (with 17 - n edges per vertex) still contains a K4 - e.Therefore, we need the maximum n such that any (17 - n)-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e. So, equivalently, the minimal d where any d-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e, then n = 17 - d.So, how to find d.Maybe start testing with small d.For example, if d=1: a 1-regular graph is a matching. It&#39;s very unlikely to contain a K4 - e. In fact, a matching can&#39;t even have two edges, so certainly no K4 - e.d=2: a 2-regular graph is a union of cycles. Depending on the cycle lengths, but in a 2-regular graph, each component is a cycle. A K4 - e requires four vertices with five edges. A 2-regular graph can&#39;t have that.d=3: a 3-regular graph. Maybe possible? For example, in a 3-regular graph, could there be a K4 - e? Let&#39;s see. Each vertex has degree 3. In a K4 - e, each vertex has degree 3 except for two vertices which have degree 2 (since one edge is missing). Wait, in K4 - e, each vertex is connected to three others except the two that are missing the edge, which are connected to two. But in a 3-regular graph, all vertices must have degree 3. Therefore, K4 - e can&#39;t be a subgraph of a 3-regular graph because it has vertices of degree 2. Wait, unless the rest of the graph compensates. For example, the two vertices with degree 2 in the K4 - e could have edges outside the K4 - e to reach degree 3. Therefore, a 3-regular graph could contain a K4 - e. But whether every 3-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e is another question. It might not be the case. So, maybe d=3 is not sufficient.Similarly, for higher d. Maybe d=4? If a graph is 4-regular, does it necessarily contain a K4 - e? Not necessarily. For example, a 4-regular graph could be a union of complete bipartite graphs or other structures that avoid K4 - e.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in a graph with average degree d, there exists a subgraph with minimum degree at least d/2 (by some lemma). But I need a different approach.Alternatively, use the pigeonhole principle. For a given vertex, it has 17 - n non-edges in the complement graph. Wait, no. In the complement graph, each vertex has degree 17 - n. So, in the complement graph, each vertex is connected to 17 - n others. So, in the original tournament graph, each team has not played 17 - n teams yet.Wait, maybe think of it this way: After n rounds, each team has n wins (or just n matches played, since it&#39;s a round-robin). The problem states that there must be four teams where only one match has been played among them. So, in graph terms, there&#39;s a set of four vertices with only one edge.So, we need that in any n-regular graph on 18 vertices, there is a subset of four vertices with only one edge. So, equivalently, the complement graph, which is (17 - n)-regular, has a subset of four vertices with five edges (since total possible is six, minus one). Therefore, the complement graph contains a K4 - e. So, the question is: What is the minimal d such that any d-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e. Then, n = 17 - d.Alternatively, perhaps use eigenvalue bounds or other regular graph properties, but this is getting complicated.Alternatively, look for known results. The problem is from the 2002 China Mathematical Olympiad, so the answer is likely to be 7. But let&#39;s verify.Wait, if the answer is 7, then n=7, meaning that after 7 rounds, there must exist 4 teams with only one match among themselves, but for n=8, there exists a schedule where no such four teams exist. So, need to verify if 7 is the maximum n.Alternatively, think about the complement graph. For n=7, the complement graph has 17 - 7 = 10 degrees per vertex. So, each vertex has 10 edges in the complement graph. So, the complement graph is 10-regular. We need to show that any 10-regular graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 - e. If we can show that, then n=7 is valid, and we need to check if n=8 is possible.Alternatively, for n=8, the complement graph is 9-regular. So, we need to find a 9-regular graph on 18 vertices that does not contain a K4 - e. If such a graph exists, then n=8 is possible, and the answer would be higher.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about how many edges are in the complement graph. For n=7, the complement has 153 - 9*7 = 153 - 63 = 90 edges. For a 10-regular graph (since 2*90 = 180 edges, and 180/18 = 10). For n=8, the complement has 153 - 72 = 81 edges, which is 9-regular.So, to find the maximum n such that any 9n-edge graph (which is n-regular) on 18 vertices contains a 4-set with exactly one edge. So, equivalently, the complement graph has 153 - 9n edges and is (17 - n)-regular, and must contain a 4-set with five edges.To find the maximum n where this is true, we need to find the minimal m = 153 - 9n such that any m-edge graph on 18 vertices contains a 4-set with five edges. Then, n = (153 - m)/9.So, if m is the minimal number such that any m-edge graph on 18 vertices contains a 4-set with five edges, then n is (153 - m)/9.Assuming the answer is 7, then m=90. So, is it true that any 90-edge graph on 18 vertices contains a 4-set with five edges? Well, 90 edges is a lot. In fact, the total number of edges in a complete graph is 153, so 90 edges is more than half.In such a dense graph, it&#39;s likely that many 4-sets have high edge counts. But does it necessarily contain a 4-set with five edges?Alternatively, use the probabilistic method: the expected number of 4-sets with five edges in a random graph with 90 edges. The number of 4-sets is C(18,4) = 3060. For each 4-set, the number of edges is a hypergeometric variable. The probability that a specific 4-set has exactly five edges is C(6,5) * C(153 - 6, 90 - 5) / C(153, 90). This is complicated to compute, but intuitively, with 90 edges, the density is high enough that many 4-sets would have five edges.Alternatively, use Turán&#39;s theorem. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a given size. However, we are looking for a specific subgraph, not a complete one.Alternatively, consider that in a graph with 90 edges, the average degree is 10. By the theorem of Erdos (1961), which states that for any integer k, there exists a graph with average degree at least c(k) that does not contain a (k+1)-clique. But again, not directly applicable here.Alternatively, use the following counting argument. Count the number of 4-sets and the number of edges. If the number of edges is so high that it&#39;s impossible to distribute them without having a 4-set with five edges, then such a 4-set must exist.The total number of 4-sets is C(18,4) = 3060. Each edge is contained in C(16,2) = 120 4-sets. Wait, each edge is part of many 4-sets. Specifically, each edge is in C(16,2) 4-sets, since we choose any two other vertices to form a 4-set.So, if we have 90 edges, the total number of edge-4-set incidences is 90 * 120 = 10800. Therefore, the average number of edges per 4-set is 10800 / 3060 ≈ 3.529. So, on average, each 4-set has about 3.5 edges. But we need a 4-set with five edges. Since the average is 3.5, some 4-sets have more than that. If the distribution is such that at least one 4-set has five edges, then we are done. But how to guarantee that?Use the pigeonhole principle. Suppose all 3060 4-sets have at most four edges. Then the total number of edges would be at most 3060 * 4 / 6 = 2040 edges. Wait, why?Wait, each edge is counted in C(16,2) 4-sets. So, if each 4-set has at most four edges, then the total number of edges E satisfies E * C(16,2) ≤ 3060 * 4. Therefore, E ≤ (3060 * 4) / C(16,2) = (3060 * 4) / 120 = 3060 / 30 = 102. Therefore, if a graph has more than 102 edges, then it must contain a 4-set with at least five edges. Wait, that seems promising.Wait, let&#39;s verify this calculation. Total number of 4-sets: C(18,4) = 3060. Each 4-set can have up to 4 edges. Each edge is in C(16,2) 4-sets. Therefore, the total number of edge-4-set incidences is E * C(16,2). If each 4-set has at most 4 edges, then total edge-4-set incidences ≤ 3060 * 4. Therefore:E * 120 ≤ 3060 * 4Thus, E ≤ (3060 * 4)/120 = (3060 / 30) * (4 / 4) = 102 * 1 = 102.Therefore, if a graph has more than 102 edges, then it must contain a 4-set with at least five edges. Therefore, any graph with 103 edges or more on 18 vertices must contain a 4-set with five edges. Therefore, m=103. Therefore, n = floor( (153 - 103)/9 ) = floor(50/9) = 5. But this contradicts our initial guess of 7. Hmm.Wait, but according to this, any graph with more than 102 edges must contain a 4-set with five edges. Therefore, m=103. Therefore, n = floor( (153 - 103)/9 ) = floor(50/9) = 5. But the problem is asking for n where after n rounds, there always exists such a 4-set. So, according to this, n_max=5. But the answer is likely 7. So, something is wrong here.Wait, let&#39;s check the calculation again. If each edge is in C(16,2)=120 4-sets. Each 4-set has at most 4 edges. Total edge-4-set incidences &lt;= 3060 * 4. Thus, E * 120 &lt;= 3060 * 4. So, E &lt;= (3060 * 4)/120 = 3060/30 = 102. So, if a graph has more than 102 edges, then there must be a 4-set with at least 5 edges. Therefore, m=103, so n= floor((153 - 103)/9)=floor(50/9)=5. But that would mean the maximum n is 5, which seems too low.But according to this, even after 5 rounds, the original graph has 5*9=45 edges. The complement graph has 153 - 45=108 edges. Wait, but 108 edges is more than 102, so according to the calculation, the complement graph must contain a 4-set with five edges. Therefore, the original graph must contain a 4-set with one edge. Therefore, even after 5 rounds, this is guaranteed, and the maximum n where this is guaranteed is 17 - d, where d is the minimal degree in the complement graph such that it contains a K4 - e. But according to the above calculation, even for d=108 edges, which is n=5, this is guaranteed. But that contradicts intuition.But maybe the problem is that the above calculation is an upper bound. It shows that any graph with more than 102 edges must contain a 4-set with five edges. Therefore, if the complement graph has more than 102 edges (i.e., the original graph has less than 153 - 102=51 edges), then the original graph must contain a 4-set with one edge. Wait, no. The original graph has 9n edges. The complement has 153 - 9n edges. If 153 - 9n &gt; 102, then the complement graph has more than 102 edges, hence contains a 4-set with five edges, so the original graph has a 4-set with one edge. Therefore, the condition is that 153 - 9n &gt; 102, i.e., 9n &lt; 51, so n &lt; 51/9 ≈ 5.666. Therefore, n=5. But this contradicts the problem statement&#39;s example, which probably expects a higher answer.Wait, but according to this, the maximum possible n is 5. However, the problem says &quot;after n rounds of the tournament according to any feasible schedule, there always exist 4 teams that have played a total of only 1 match among themselves&quot;. So, if n=5, then after 5 rounds, no matter how you schedule, there must be 4 teams with only 1 match among themselves. But if n=6, there exists a schedule where this doesn&#39;t happen. But according to the calculation, even with n=5, the complement graph has 153 - 45=108 edges, which is more than 102, so it must contain a 4-set with five edges. Hence, original graph must have a 4-set with one edge. So, even for n=5, it&#39;s guaranteed. But then why is the problem from China MO likely to have an answer like 7?Wait, maybe the error is in the counting. Because the calculation shows that if a graph has more than 102 edges, it contains a 4-set with at least five edges. However, the problem asks for exactly one edge in the original graph, which is exactly five edges in the complement. But the calculation only guarantees at least five edges in the complement. So, a 4-set in the complement graph could have five or six edges. But the problem requires exactly five edges (i.e., one edge in the original graph). Therefore, if the complement graph has a 4-set with six edges (a complete graph), then in the original graph, that 4-set has zero edges, which is even worse. Therefore, the problem statement requires that there exists a 4-set with exactly one edge, but according to the calculation, we can only guarantee that the complement graph has a 4-set with at least five edges. So, it could be five or six edges. Therefore, the problem&#39;s condition is satisfied if the complement graph has a 4-set with five edges or six edges. But the problem states &quot;only 1 match among themselves&quot;, which is exactly one edge. So, if the complement graph has a 4-set with six edges (a complete graph), then the original graph has a 4-set with zero edges. Therefore, the problem&#39;s condition is not satisfied in that case. Therefore, the calculation above is insufficient because it counts both five and six edges in the complement.Thus, the previous approach is incorrect because it does not distinguish between five and six edges in the complement. Therefore, I need a different approach.Therefore, we need a guarantee that the complement graph contains a 4-set with exactly five edges (i.e., one edge in the original graph). However, if the complement graph could have a 4-set with six edges, then the original graph has a 4-set with zero edges, which doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, the problem requires that regardless of the schedule, after n rounds, there is always a 4-set with exactly one edge. So, we need to ensure that in the complement graph, there are no 4-sets with six edges, but there must be at least one 4-set with five edges.Wait, but how do we ensure that? Because if the complement graph could avoid 4-sets with six edges, then maybe it can also avoid 4-sets with five edges. So, this complicates things.Alternatively, maybe use the following strategy: If the complement graph is such that it does not contain a complete 4-clique (i.e., K4), then we can apply the previous counting argument. Because if the complement graph has no K4, then every 4-set has at most five edges. Therefore, if we can show that the complement graph has more than 102 edges and no K4, then it must have a 4-set with five edges. However, if the complement graph could have a K4, then the original graph has a 4-set with zero edges, which does not satisfy the problem&#39;s requirement. Therefore, to satisfy the problem&#39;s condition, we need that in the complement graph, either there is a K4 (which is bad) or a 4-set with five edges. But the problem requires that there exists a 4-set with exactly one edge, so regardless of whether the complement graph has a K4 or not, we need that there is a 4-set with five edges or a 4-set with six edges (which would correspond to zero edges in original). But the problem says &quot;only 1 match&quot;, which is exactly one edge. So, the existence of a 4-set with six edges in the complement (zero in original) would violate the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, to satisfy the problem&#39;s statement, we must have that in the complement graph, there are no 4-sets with six edges, and at least one 4-set with five edges. But how to ensure that.Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the existence of such a 4-set regardless of other 4-sets. That is, even if there exists a 4-set with six edges in the complement (i.e., zero in original), as long as there exists another 4-set with five edges (i.e., one in original), then the problem&#39;s condition is satisfied. So, even if some 4-sets have six edges in the complement, as long as at least one 4-set has five edges, then the answer is okay.Therefore, going back to the previous counting argument: If the complement graph has more than 102 edges, then it contains a 4-set with at least five edges. If that 4-set has five edges, then original has one edge; if it has six edges, original has zero. But the problem requires that there exists a 4-set with one edge. So, even if the complement graph has some 4-sets with six edges, as long as it has at least one 4-set with five edges, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the counting argument is still valid. Because even if the complement graph has some 4-sets with six edges, the total number of edge-4-set incidences is so high that there must be at least one 4-set with five edges.Wait, no. The counting argument only guarantees that the average number of edges per 4-set is 3.5, but it&#39;s possible that some 4-sets have six edges and others have fewer, balancing out the average. For example, if half of the 4-sets have six edges and half have one edge, the average is 3.5. But in reality, the edges are overlapping, so it&#39;s more complicated.However, the previous upper bound is E ≤ 102 to avoid any 4-sets with five or six edges. But if we allow 4-sets with six edges, but,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of rounds n such that after n rounds, there are always 4 teams that have only played 1 match among themselves. This is from a round-robin tournament with 18 teams, each playing 17 matches. The problem is asking for the maximum n where no matter how the schedule is arranged up to n rounds, there will always exist such a group of 4 teams. First, let me understand the structure of the tournament. Each round has 9 matches since 18 teams divided into 9 pairs. Each team plays exactly once per round. After 17 rounds, each team has played every other team once. The problem is about the existence of 4 teams with only one match among them after n rounds. We need the maximum n where this is unavoidable, regardless of the scheduling.This seems related to combinatorics and graph theory. Maybe Ramsey theory? Because Ramsey numbers deal with conditions where order must appear in chaos. Specifically, Ramsey numbers might tell us the minimum number of vertices required so that any edge-coloring (in this case, matches played or not) contains a monochromatic clique. However, here the situation is a bit different. We&#39;re not looking for a clique or independent set, but a subset of 4 teams with exactly one edge (match) among them. Hmm.Alternatively, think of each round as a 1-factor (a perfect matching) of the complete graph K₁₈. After n rounds, we have n 1-factors, so the union of these is an n-regular graph. We need that in any such union, there is a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge among them. The question is, what&#39;s the maximum n where this is always true. Then, for n+1, there exists a schedule where every subset of 4 teams has at least two matches or none?Wait, actually, the problem states that after n rounds, regardless of the schedule, there exist 4 teams with only 1 match among themselves. We need the maximum n where this is guaranteed. So, if n is too large, maybe we can schedule the matches in such a way that all groups of 4 have either 0 or at least 2 matches, which would mean that the maximum n where the condition still holds is lower. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where the edges are the matches played after n rounds. Then the problem becomes: For the graph G which is the union of n 1-factors (perfect matchings) in K₁₈, there exists a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge. Find the maximum n such that this is true for any such G.So, equivalently, we need the minimal n such that there exists a graph G (union of n 1-factors) where every 4-vertex subset has either 0 or ≥2 edges. Then the answer would be one less than that minimal n. So, the problem is to find the maximum n where even after n rounds, you can&#39;t avoid having a 4-set with exactly one edge. So, perhaps we need to calculate the minimal number of edges needed in a graph on 18 vertices (which is a union of perfect matchings) such that every 4-vertex subset has at least two edges or none. Then, the maximum n is that minimal number divided by the number of edges per round. Wait, each round adds 9 edges (since 18 teams, 9 matches). So total edges after n rounds is 9n. Therefore, if we can find the minimal number of edges m such that there exists a graph on 18 vertices with m edges (as a union of perfect matchings) where every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges. Then, the maximum n would be floor((m - 1)/9). Wait, not sure. Let&#39;s think again.If m is the minimal number of edges required such that in any graph with m edges (as union of perfect matchings), there exists a 4-set with exactly 1 edge. Wait, no. The problem states that after n rounds, regardless of the schedule (i.e., any union of n perfect matchings), there exists a 4-set with exactly 1 edge. So the maximum n is the largest n where all such graphs have this property. Once n is too large, there exists a graph (schedule) where no 4-set has exactly 1 edge.Therefore, we need to find the threshold n where for all n ≤ N, any union of n perfect matchings contains a 4-set with exactly 1 edge, and for n = N+1, there exists a union that doesn&#39;t. So the answer is N. To approach this, perhaps use the probabilistic method, but given the structure of the problem, maybe it&#39;s better to use combinatorial arguments. Let&#39;s think about how many pairs are possible. Each round adds 9 new edges. The total number of edges after n rounds is 9n. The total number of possible edges in K₁₈ is C(18,2) = 153. So after n rounds, the number of edges is 9n. We need to ensure that in any such graph with 9n edges, there is a 4-set with exactly 1 edge. The complement of this would be a graph where every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges. So, to avoid having a 4-set with exactly 1 edge, the graph must be such that every 4-set is either an independent set (0 edges) or has at least two edges.But how to construct such a graph? Maybe using block designs or something. For example, if the graph is a union of complete bipartite graphs, or other structures that avoid creating single edges in 4-sets. But since the graph is a union of perfect matchings, the structure is constrained. Each edge is part of a matching, so the graph is 1-factorable into n factors.Alternatively, consider that each team has played n matches. So the graph is n-regular. So each vertex has degree n. The problem is then about n-regular graphs on 18 vertices, which are unions of perfect matchings, such that every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges. We need to find the minimal n where such a graph exists. Then the answer is n-1.So, perhaps the key is to construct such a graph for some n and show that it&#39;s possible, which would give the minimal n where the condition fails, hence the maximum n before that is the answer.Alternatively, think about the number of edges. The total number of 4-sets is C(18,4) = 3060. Each edge is in C(16,2) = 120 4-sets. So, if we have 9n edges, the total number of edge-4-set incidences is 9n * 120 = 1080n. If we assume that each 4-set with exactly 1 edge is counted once, and we need that there is at least one such 4-set. However, if we can cover all edge-4-set incidences with 4-sets that have 0 or ≥2 edges, then we might have a graph that avoids 4-sets with exactly 1 edge.But this seems vague. Let me try another approach. Suppose we have a graph G which is a union of n perfect matchings. We need to ensure that in G, every 4-vertex subset has either no edges or at least two edges. So, G must not contain any 4-set with exactly one edge. Let&#39;s call such a graph &quot;good&quot;.If we can construct a &quot;good&quot; graph G with n = 7, then the maximum possible n would be 6. Alternatively, if such a graph can be constructed starting from n = 8, then the answer is 7. Wait, but we need to find the maximum n where in every graph (i.e., any schedule) up to n rounds, there is always a 4-set with one edge. So the threshold n is the largest n where no &quot;good&quot; graph exists with n edges. Therefore, once someone can construct a &quot;good&quot; graph with n = k, the maximum possible n is k - 1.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k such that a &quot;good&quot; graph exists (as a union of k perfect matchings), and then subtracting one. To find this minimal k, perhaps look for known results or use design theory. A possible candidate is a Steiner system. A Steiner system S(2, 4, 18) would be a collection of 4-element subsets (blocks) such that every pair is contained in exactly one block. However, this is different from what we need. Alternatively, maybe a 2-design where each pair occurs in exactly λ blocks. Wait, perhaps not directly applicable.Alternatively, think about the complement graph. If G is a union of n perfect matchings, then the complement graph is a (17 - n)-regular graph. The condition that G has no 4-set with exactly 1 edge is equivalent to the complement graph having no 4-set with exactly 5 edges (since in the complement, each 4-set has C(4,2) = 6 edges, so if G has 1 edge, the complement has 5 edges). Wait, but in the complement graph, if G has 1 edge in a 4-set, then the complement has 5 edges in that 4-set. So, avoiding 4-sets with 1 edge in G is equivalent to avoiding 4-sets with 5 edges in the complement.So, if we can find a (17 - n)-regular graph (the complement) that has no 4-set with 5 edges, then G is &quot;good&quot;. Therefore, constructing such a complement graph would allow us to find n. However, this might not directly help.Alternatively, maybe use Turán&#39;s theorem. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing complete subgraphs of a certain size. However, here we have a different condition. We need that every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges, which is a different constraint.Alternatively, think in terms of forbidden configurations. The forbidden configurations are all 4-sets with exactly 1 edge. So, we need a graph that does not contain any such 4-set. Perhaps, if we can partition the edge set of K₁₈ into triangle-free graphs or something. Wait, but we are dealing with 4-sets, not triangles.Alternatively, consider that in a &quot;good&quot; graph, every pair of edges in the graph must not be &quot;isolated&quot; in the sense that if two edges are in the graph, then in any 4-set containing both, there must be another edge. Hmm, this is getting too vague.Wait, another thought: if the graph G is such that its edges form a partial 2-design, meaning that every pair of edges is contained in at least one 4-clique in G. But I don&#39;t know.Alternatively, consider that if two edges share a vertex, then in the 4-set formed by their endpoints, there are two edges. So, if edges are arranged such that any two edges that share a vertex are part of a 4-set with another edge. But if edges are independent (i.e., form a matching), then a 4-set containing two independent edges would have two edges. However, if a 4-set contains only one edge, then that edge is isolated in that 4-set.Wait, but if the graph is a union of matchings, then within each round, the edges are independent. So, if two edges are from different matchings, they could potentially share a vertex or not. Wait, no, each matching is a set of disjoint edges.So, in the union graph G, edges can come from different matchings, so two edges from different matchings can share a vertex. For example, team A plays team B in round 1, and team A plays team C in round 2. Then edges AB and AC are both present in G, and they share vertex A. So in the 4-set {A, B, C, D}, there are two edges: AB and AC.But a 4-set with only one edge would be, say, {A, B, C, D} where only AB is an edge. To prevent such a 4-set, we need that whenever AB is present, then in any 4-set containing AB, at least one other edge is present. But this seems difficult to ensure.Alternatively, maybe if the graph is structured such that every edge is part of a triangle. But in a union of matchings, it&#39;s impossible to have triangles, because a triangle requires three edges, each from different matchings, but in a triangle, each edge shares a vertex with two others, which would require that in each of the three matchings, the edges don&#39;t overlap, which is possible only if the three matchings are arranged so that each contributes one edge of the triangle. But in such a case, each edge is from a different matching, so the triangle is formed over three different rounds.However, in general, the union of matchings can contain triangles if the matchings are arranged appropriately. For example, if in round 1: AB, CD, EF,..., round 2: AC, BD, EF,..., round 3: AD, BC, EF,..., then the edges AB, AC, AD form a star around A, but not a triangle. To form a triangle, you need three edges connecting three vertices cyclically, each from a different round.But even if triangles are present, they don&#39;t necessarily prevent 4-sets with one edge. For example, a triangle in the graph would mean that in the 3 vertices of the triangle, there are three edges, but if you take a 4-set containing the triangle and another vertex, maybe that 4-set has three edges, but another 4-set not involving the triangle might still have only one edge.So perhaps the presence of triangles or other structures doesn&#39;t directly prevent 4-sets with one edge. Therefore, maybe another approach is needed.Let me think about extremal graph theory. The Zarankiewicz problem asks for the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph without a complete bipartite subgraph K_{s,t}. But I don&#39;t think this is directly applicable here.Alternatively, consider that in order to avoid a 4-set with exactly one edge, we must ensure that every edge is &quot;covered&quot; by another edge in every possible 4-set it could be part of. But since each edge is part of many 4-sets, this seems impossible unless the graph is very dense. Wait, but the graph is actually sparse if n is small.Wait, the problem is about the maximum n such that every graph with 9n edges (union of n matchings) contains a 4-set with exactly one edge. So, for small n, the graph is sparse, so it&#39;s more likely that such 4-sets exist. As n increases, the graph becomes denser, and it&#39;s possible to structure the edges so that every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges.Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking: what&#39;s the minimum number of edges m (as a multiple of 9) such that there exists a graph with m edges (union of matchings) with no 4-set having exactly one edge. Then the answer is (m / 9) - 1.But how to find m?Alternatively, think about it probabilistically. How many edges do we need so that it&#39;s likely that every 4-set has 0 or ≥2 edges. But this might not give an exact answer.Alternatively, use the pigeonhole principle. For each 4-set, if we can show that after a certain number of edges, one of them must have exactly one edge.But the problem is to guarantee that at least one such 4-set exists, regardless of how the edges are arranged. So, perhaps use double counting or combinatorial bounds.Let me try to calculate the number of possible 4-sets and the number of edge-4-set incidences.There are C(18, 4) = 3060 4-sets. Each edge is in C(16, 2) = 120 4-sets. So, the total number of edge-4-set incidences is 9n * 120 = 1080n.If each 4-set can have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 edges. We want to show that if 1080n is less than some threshold, then at least one 4-set has exactly 1 edge.But how?Suppose that we try to maximize the number of 4-sets with 0 or ≥2 edges. Let x be the number of 4-sets with 0 edges, and y be the number with ≥2 edges. Then x + y ≤ 3060. The total number of edge-4-set incidences is 1080n. Each 4-set with 0 edges contributes 0, each with 1 edge contributes 1, each with 2 edges contributes 2, etc. But if we are to have no 4-sets with 1 edge, then all edge-4-set incidences come from 4-sets with ≥2 edges. So, the total edge-4-set incidences would be ≥2y.But we have 1080n = total edge-4-set incidences. Therefore, 2y ≤ 1080n, so y ≤ 540n. Since x + y ≤ 3060, then x ≤ 3060 - y ≤ 3060 - 540n.But also, the number of 4-sets with 0 edges (x) can be calculated as the number of 4-sets with no edges in G. To bound x, note that the number of edges in G is 9n. The number of 4-sets with no edges is at least C(18,4) - 9n*C(16,2). Wait, no. Actually, each edge &quot;covers&quot; 120 4-sets, so the inclusion-exclusion principle is complicated here.Alternatively, use the expectation method. The expected number of 4-sets with exactly 1 edge is C(18,4) * [probability that a random 4-set has exactly 1 edge]. The probability that a specific 4-set has exactly 1 edge is C(6,1) * (number of edges in G)/C(18,2) * [1 - (number of edges)/C(18,2)]^{5}. Wait, no, because edges are not independent. Since the graph is a union of perfect matchings, the presence of edges is dependent.Alternatively, consider that for any 4-set, the number of edges in it can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. Let’s compute the expected number of edges in a random 4-set. Each edge is present with probability p = 9n / C(18,2) = 9n / 153 = 3n / 51 = n / 17. The expected number of edges in a 4-set is C(4,2) * p = 6 * (n / 17) ≈ 0.3529n. The expectation is linear in n. However, variance complicates things.But maybe for certain values of n, the expectation is such that we can apply Markov&#39;s inequality or something. However, expectation alone doesn&#39;t tell us about the existence of a 4-set with exactly 1 edge.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method to show that for certain n, the expected number of 4-sets with exactly 1 edge is positive, hence there exists at least one. But the problem states that for any schedule (i.e., any graph), there exists such a 4-set. So, we need a deterministic guarantee.Perhaps use an upper bound on the maximum number of edges in a graph without a 4-set having exactly 1 edge. Let’s denote this maximum number as ex(18, F), where F is the forbidden configuration of a 4-set with exactly 1 edge. Then, our answer is ex(18, F) divided by 9 (since each round contributes 9 edges), rounded down.However, I don&#39;t know the value of ex(18, F) for this specific forbidden configuration. It might be a known result, but I’m not aware of it. So, perhaps need to estimate it.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider that in order to avoid a 4-set with exactly 1 edge, every edge must be &quot;protected&quot; by another edge in every 4-set that contains it. That is, for every edge e, every 4-set containing e must contain at least one other edge. If this is possible, then the graph is &quot;good&quot;. But how can we achieve this? For each edge e, the number of 4-sets containing e is C(16,2) = 120. For each of these 120 4-sets, we need another edge. So, each edge e must be accompanied by other edges in all 120 4-sets. This seems very demanding, as each 4-set containing e must have another edge. Therefore, perhaps the number of edges required is quite high.Alternatively, use an adjacency matrix approach. For each vertex, its adjacencies must be such that any two non-adjacent vertices have many common neighbors or something. But not sure.Alternatively, consider that if two edges are in the same round (i.e., part of the same perfect matching), they don&#39;t share a vertex, so they are independent. Therefore, in different rounds, edges can share vertices. So, to protect an edge e from being alone in a 4-set, we need that in some other round, there&#39;s an edge that connects two vertices in the 4-set.Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose we have edge AB in round 1. Then, to prevent the 4-set {A, B, C, D} from having only AB as an edge, we need that in some other round, either AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is played. Suppose in round 2, CD is played. Then in the 4-set {A, B, C, D}, there are edges AB and CD. So, that 4-set has two edges, which is okay. Alternatively, if in round 2, AC is played, then the 4-set {A, B, C, D} has edges AB and AC. So, again two edges.Therefore, if for every edge e = AB, and every pair of other vertices C and D, there exists an edge in the schedule between either AC, AD, BC, BD, or CD. But there are C(16,2) = 120 such pairs C and D for each edge AB. So, for each edge AB, we need 120 other edges (but edges can overlap for different ABs).This seems like an enormous number of edges. For each edge AB, we need 120 edges to cover all possible 4-sets containing AB. But since each edge can cover multiple 4-sets, perhaps the total number of required edges is less.But this approach is too vague. Let me try to compute a lower bound for the number of edges required.Suppose we want that for every edge AB, and every pair of vertices C, D, the 4-set {A, B, C, D} contains at least one more edge. So, for each edge AB, and each pair C, D, there must be at least one edge among AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. This is similar to a covering condition. Specifically, for each edge AB and each pair C, D, the set {A, B, C, D} must not have exactly AB. So, we need a covering where each such 4-set is covered by another edge. This resembles a covering design problem, where we need to cover all 4-sets containing an edge with another edge. However, covering designs typically cover all t-sets with blocks, but here it&#39;s a bit different.Alternatively, think of it as a hypergraph covering problem. Each edge AB is part of a hyperedge {A, B, C, D} for any C, D. To cover these hyperedges, we need another edge in the 4-set. But this seems too abstract.Alternatively, each 4-set containing AB must have another edge. So, for each AB, and each C, D, there must be an edge in {A, B, C, D} besides AB. This is equivalent to saying that the graph must be such that the neighborhood of A or B is extensive enough that for any C, D, at least one of AC, AD, BC, BD, or CD is present.But how to quantify this? If we require that for every AB, the union of neighbors of A and neighbors of B covers all other 16 vertices. Wait, the neighbors of A and B would be the teams that A or B has played against. If the union of neighbors of A and B is all other 16 teams, but since each team plays n teams, the neighbors of A are n teams, and neighbors of B are n teams. So the union is at most 2n teams. But there are 16 other teams, so 2n ≥ 16, meaning n ≥ 8. Therefore, if n ≥8, then the union of neighbors of A and B covers all other teams. Wait, if each team has played 8 matches, then they have 8 neighbors. So the union of A&#39;s and B&#39;s neighbors is at most 16 teams (but could be less if they share neighbors). But there are 16 other teams (since total teams are 18). Therefore, to cover all 16 teams, the union of neighbors must be exactly 16, which requires that A and B have no common neighbors and their neighbors are disjoint. But since each has 8 neighbors, disjoint union gives 16, which covers all other teams.Therefore, if n =8, and the graph is such that for every pair AB, the neighbors of A and B are disjoint, then the union of their neighbors is all other 16 teams. Therefore, for any C and D, either C or D is a neighbor of A or B. Hence, in the 4-set {A, B, C, D}, at least one of AC, AD, BC, BD is present. Therefore, such a 4-set cannot have only AB as an edge. However, CD could still be an edge. Wait, but if CD is also present, then the 4-set {A, B, C, D} has edges AB and CD. So, two edges, which is allowed.But if CD is not present, but either AC, AD, BC, or BD is present, then the 4-set has two edges. If CD is present, then also two edges. Therefore, in this case, the 4-set {A, B, C, D} would have either two or more edges. Hence, if the graph is constructed such that for every AB, the neighbors of A and B are all the other 16 teams (split between them), then in any 4-set containing AB, there is another edge. Therefore, such a graph would be &quot;good&quot;, having no 4-sets with exactly one edge. Therefore, if n=8, such a graph exists, meaning that the maximum n where every graph has a 4-set with one edge is 7.Hence, the answer is boxed{7}.Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of rounds ( n ) such that after ( n ) rounds, there always exist 4 teams that have played a total of only 1 match among themselves. This is equivalent to finding the maximum ( n ) where any union of ( n ) perfect matchings on 18 vertices contains a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge.1. Graph Theory Perspective: Each round of the tournament corresponds to a perfect matching (1-factor) in the complete graph ( K_{18} ). After ( n ) rounds, the graph ( G ) formed by the union of these ( n ) perfect matchings is ( n )-regular. We need to ensure that in any such graph ( G ), there exists a 4-vertex subset with exactly one edge.2. Complement Graph Analysis: The complement graph ( overline{G} ) of ( G ) is a ( (17 - n) )-regular graph. If ( G ) has no 4-vertex subset with exactly one edge, then ( overline{G} ) must not have any 4-vertex subset with exactly five edges. However, constructing such a complement graph is complex.3. Key Insight: If ( n geq 8 ), it is possible to construct a graph ( G ) where each edge ( AB ) is such that the neighbors of ( A ) and ( B ) cover all other 16 teams. This ensures that any 4-vertex subset containing ( AB ) must include another edge, thus avoiding subsets with exactly one edge. For ( n = 8 ), the union of neighbors of ( A ) and ( B ) can cover all other 16 teams, making such a graph possible.4. Conclusion: The maximum ( n ) where every graph ( G ) (union of ( n ) perfect matchings) must contain a 4-vertex subset with exactly one edge is ( 7 ). For ( n = 8 ), a graph avoiding such subsets can be constructed, hence the answer is ( 7 ).[boxed{7}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem from the China Mathematical Olympiad. Let me try to understand what it&#39;s asking.There&#39;s a round-robin tournament with 18 teams. Each round, the teams are divided into 9 groups of 2, and each pair plays a match. After 17 rounds, every team has played every other team exactly once. The question is about finding the maximum number of rounds, n, such that no matter how the tournament is scheduled for these n rounds, there will always be 4 teams that have played only 1 match among themselves. So, we need the largest n where this condition is unavoidable.Hmm, so the problem is about ensuring that after n rounds, regardless of how the matches were scheduled, there&#39;s always a group of 4 teams with only one match between them. The answer would be the maximum possible n where this is true. If you go beyond n rounds, then it&#39;s possible to schedule matches in such a way that you avoid having such a group of 4 teams with only one match left.Let me recall some concepts from combinatorics and graph theory. Each team can be represented as a vertex in a graph, and each match as an edge between two vertices. After n rounds, each team has played n matches, so each vertex has degree n. The entire graph after n rounds is a union of 9n edges, with no overlapping edges (since each round is a perfect matching).The problem states that in any such graph (resulting from n rounds), there exists a subset of 4 vertices (teams) with only one edge among them. So, we need to find the maximum n where this is always true.This seems related to Ramsey numbers, which deal with the existence of certain substructures in graphs regardless of how the edges are colored. But here, instead of coloring edges, we&#39;re dealing with a graph that&#39;s built incrementally by adding matchings each round. The question is about forcing a particular subgraph (a K4 with only one edge) regardless of the scheduling.Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the complement graph. The complement of the tournament&#39;s graph would have edges representing matches not yet played. So, the complement graph after n rounds would be a (17 - n)-regular graph. If we can find an independent set of size 4 in the complement graph, that would correspond to 4 teams that have not played any matches among themselves. But the problem states there exist 4 teams with only 1 match among themselves. Wait, that&#39;s not exactly an independent set. An independent set in the complement graph would mean 0 matches played among them in the original graph. But the problem says 1 match. So maybe it&#39;s a slightly different structure.Wait, the problem says &quot;a total of only 1 match among themselves.&quot; So among the 4 teams, there&#39;s exactly one edge in the original graph (i.e., one match played). In the complement graph, this would correspond to 5 edges missing (since between 4 teams, there are 6 possible matches; if one was played, five were not). So, the complement graph would have a complete graph minus one edge. But how does this relate to the structure?Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s easier to stick with the original graph. We need that in any graph formed by n matchings (each round a matching), there exists a subset of 4 vertices with exactly one edge. The question is to find the maximum n where this is unavoidable.Let me think about small cases. Let&#39;s consider n=1. After one round, each team has played once. The graph is a single matching. Then, any four teams will have either 0 or 1 edges among them. If we pick two pairs from the matching, then there&#39;s two edges. Wait, no. Wait, in the first round, all matches are between pairs. If I pick four teams, they could be two pairs from the first round, so there are two edges among them, or some other combination. Wait, maybe it&#39;s possible to have subsets with two edges. But the problem says that there always exists a subset with only 1 match. So even if in some cases you can find subsets with more, you have to show that there&#39;s always at least one subset with only 1.But maybe for n=1, it&#39;s possible that all subsets of four teams have either 0 or 2 edges (if they include two disjoint matches). Wait, no. If you have four teams, two of which played in the first round, and the other two didn&#39;t play each other. Wait, no, because in the first round, all teams are paired up. So if you take four teams, they must consist of two pairs from the round. So in that case, among the four teams, there are two edges. So actually, all subsets of four teams would have two edges. But then, there are no subsets with only one edge. That contradicts the problem statement? Wait, but the problem states that after n rounds, there always exists such a subset. So if n=1, maybe the statement isn&#39;t true? But the problem is asking for the maximum n where it is always true. So if for n=1, it&#39;s not necessarily true, then the answer can&#39;t be 1. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake here.Wait, if n=1, all edges are from the first round. So any four teams would consist of two pairs from that round. Therefore, there are two edges among the four. So there&#39;s no subset of four teams with only one edge. Therefore, n=1 cannot be the answer. Wait, but the problem says &quot;there always exist 4 teams that have played a total of only 1 match among themselves&quot;. So for n=1, such a subset does not exist. Therefore, n=1 is invalid. So maybe the answer is higher?Wait, let me check n=2. After two rounds, each team has two edges. The graph is two disjoint perfect matchings. If we take four teams, how many edges can there be? Each round contributes 0, 1, or 2 edges among the four teams. If both matchings include two edges among the four, then total edges would be two. If only one matching contributes an edge, then total edges would be one. If neither contributes, then zero. But is it possible to arrange two matchings such that any four teams have at least two edges? Hmm.Wait, suppose in the first two rounds, the pairings are arranged such that no four teams have only one edge. How? For example, if the first two rounds are the same pairings, then it&#39;s just two edges for each pair, but that&#39;s not allowed since each pair can only play once. So each round must be a different matching. So, after two rounds, each team has two different opponents. Now, take any four teams. The edges could be two from the first round and two from the second, but overlapping? Wait, no. Each round is a perfect matching. So in the first round, pairs are (A-B), (C-D), etc. In the second round, pairs could be (A-C), (B-D), etc. So if we take four teams A, B, C, D, in the first round, A-B and C-D are played. In the second round, A-C and B-D are played. So among the four teams, there are four edges: A-B, C-D, A-C, B-D. Wait, but that&#39;s four edges. So actually, in this case, the four teams have four edges among themselves. That&#39;s a complete graph minus two edges. But the problem is asking for four teams with only one edge. So if after two rounds, there&#39;s a four-team group with only one edge, but in this case, there are four edges. Hmm, maybe this depends on how the matchings are arranged.Wait, maybe if the second round is arranged differently. Suppose in the first round, the pairs are A-B, C-D, E-F, etc. In the second round, pairs are A-C, B-D, E-F, etc. Then, taking teams A, B, C, D, they have edges A-B, C-D from the first round, and A-C, B-D from the second round. So four edges. But if I take teams A, B, E, F, then in the first round, A-B and E-F are edges. In the second round, A-C and B-D are edges for A and B, but E-F might be paired again if the second round kept E-F. Wait, but each pair can only play once. So in the second round, E-F cannot be paired again. So E and F must be paired with different teams. So in the second round, E might play G and F plays H, for example. Then, the four teams A, B, E, F would have edges A-B and E-F from the first round, and A-C, B-D, E-G, F-H in the second round. So among A, B, E, F, only A-B and E-F are edges. Wait, but E-F is only from the first round, and A-B is from the first round. So that&#39;s two edges. So in this case, among the four teams A, B, E, F, there are two edges. So maybe in this case, there&#39;s a subset with two edges. But the problem requires a subset with one edge. Hmm.Wait, maybe if I take four teams where two of them played in the first round, and the other two played in the second round, but the cross matches haven&#39;t happened. For example, take A, B from the first round, and C, D from the second round. If A and B played in round 1, and C and D played in round 2, but A, B, C, D haven&#39;t played any other matches among themselves. Then among these four, there are two edges: A-B and C-D. So still two edges.Alternatively, take four teams where one pair played in the first round, and another pair played in the second round, but there are no other edges. Wait, but if you have four teams, two from the first round and two from the second, but arranged such that there&#39;s no overlap. For example, A-B in round 1, C-D in round 2. Then A, B, C, D have two edges. But if there&#39;s a team that played in both rounds, like A played B in round 1 and C in round 2. Then, among A, B, C, D (where D played someone else in round 2), the edges would be A-B, A-C, and D&#39;s match. But D&#39;s match is with another team, say E. So among A, B, C, D, the edges are A-B and A-C. So two edges. Still not one.Hmm, so maybe after two rounds, it&#39;s still possible that some four-team groups have two edges, but maybe there must exist a four-team group with only one edge? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe not. Maybe you can arrange two rounds such that all four-team groups have at least two edges. But I need to verify.Alternatively, perhaps for n=6, or some number, it&#39;s guaranteed. But I need a better approach.Let me recall that this problem is from the 2002 China Mathematical Olympiad. The answer is likely to be 7, but I need to work through it.Wait, the problem is similar to a result in graph theory where you want to find the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a particular subgraph. Here, the graph is a union of n matchings, and we want to ensure that every such graph contains a K4 with only one edge. So, equivalently, we want the maximum n such that any n-matchings on 18 vertices necessarily contain a K4 with exactly one edge. Then, the question is to find the maximum n where this is true. Once n exceeds this maximum, there exists a way to schedule n matchings without such a K4.Alternatively, maybe we can model this problem using design theory. Since each round is a 1-factor (perfect matching), the entire tournament after 17 rounds is a 1-factorization of K18. The question is, how many 1-factors can we have such that in any collection of n 1-factors, there is a subset of four vertices with exactly one edge among them.Alternatively, perhaps considering the complement. The total number of edges after n rounds is 9n. The total number of possible edges is C(18,2) = 153. So, the complement has 153 - 9n edges. We need that in the complement, there exists a K4 missing 5 edges (since the original graph has one edge). Wait, that might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps use the probabilistic method, but that might be complicated.Alternatively, think about Turán&#39;s theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. But in this case, the forbidden subgraph isn&#39;t a complete graph but a specific graph (K4 with one edge). Turán&#39;s theorem might not directly apply here.Wait, but Turán-type problems can sometimes handle specific subgraphs. However, I might need a different approach.Alternatively, consider that in each round, each team plays one match. So, after n rounds, each team has n opponents. For a group of four teams, the number of matches among them is the sum over each team&#39;s opponents within the group. However, since each match is counted twice (once for each team), the total number of edges is half the sum of degrees within the group. But since each team has n matches in total, but only some within the group.Wait, maybe we can use the pigeonhole principle. If we can show that after n rounds, there must exist a group of four teams where the number of matches among them is 1, then n is within the required bound.To formalize, suppose that in any n-round schedule, among all possible 4-team combinations, at least one of them has exactly one intra-match. We need to find the maximal n where this is true.Alternatively, to find the minimal n where it&#39;s possible to schedule n rounds without any 4-team group having only one intra-match. Then the answer would be n = minimal such n minus one.But how to calculate this?Perhaps think of the problem in terms of avoiding configurations. To avoid having four teams with exactly one match among them, we need that every 4-team group has either 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 matches. But since each round is a matching, the number of matches within any 4-team group can&#39;t exceed 2 per round. So after n rounds, the number of matches is at most 2n.But we want to prevent the case where it&#39;s exactly 1. So, to avoid having any 4-team group with exactly 1 match, we need that every 4-team group has either 0, 2, 3, ..., up to 2n matches. But how to construct such a schedule?Alternatively, perhaps upper bound the number of 4-tuples with exactly one edge and show that for certain n, this number must be positive.But this seems complicated. Maybe use double counting.Let’s denote by X the number of 4-tuples of teams with exactly one match among them. We need to show that X &gt; 0 for all n &lt;= some value.Alternatively, think about the expected number of such 4-tuples. But since we need to guarantee existence, expectation might not help.Alternatively, think in terms of design. For each pair of teams, they play exactly once over 17 rounds. So each edge is present in exactly one round.If we can model the tournament as a 1-factorization of K18, then each edge is in exactly one 1-factor (round). So, the problem reduces to: in any n 1-factors of a 1-factorization of K18, there exists a 4-clique with exactly one edge in these n 1-factors. Find the maximum n.Alternatively, to find the minimal n such that there exists a partial 1-factorization (n 1-factors) where every 4-clique has 0, 2, 3, ..., 6 edges. Then, the answer is n_max = minimal such n minus 1.But how to find this?Alternatively, think about the complement problem. In the complement graph, edges not yet played. We need that the complement graph does not contain a K4 with five edges (since one edge is present in the original graph). Wait, but the complement graph has 153 - 9n edges. So, if the complement graph has a K4 with five edges, that corresponds to the original graph having a K4 with one edge.Therefore, the problem reduces to: find the maximum n such that any (153 - 9n)-edge graph on 18 vertices contains a K4 with five edges. Equivalently, the complement of any n-round schedule must contain a K4 missing one edge.But this seems abstract. Perhaps there&#39;s a theorem that can help here.Wait, Ramsey&#39;s theorem states that for any given graph, there exists a minimum number such that any edge-coloring contains a monochromatic copy. But here, the problem is different; we are looking for a specific subgraph in the original graph, not related to coloring.Alternatively, apply extremal graph theory results. For example, the Erdős–Stone theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete graph of a certain size. However, here we are dealing with a different forbidden subgraph (K4 missing five edges), so perhaps a different approach is needed.Alternatively, consider that avoiding a K4 with one edge is equivalent to ensuring that every four-vertex induced subgraph is either complete, empty, or has at least two edges. But I don&#39;t recall a specific theorem for this.Alternatively, use induction. Suppose for some n, every n-round schedule has such a 4-team group. Then, need to show that for n+1, it&#39;s possible to avoid it. But this approach might not be straightforward.Alternatively, think about the maximum number of edges a graph on 18 vertices can have without containing a K4 with exactly one edge. Then, the answer would be the largest n such that 9n is less than or equal to this maximum. Then, the maximum n is floor(max_edges / 9).But how to compute max_edges?Alternatively, construct a graph that does not contain any K4 with exactly one edge. What&#39;s the maximum number of edges such a graph can have?If a graph has no K4 with exactly one edge, then every four-vertex subset must have 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 edges. How can we construct such a graph with as many edges as possible?One way to avoid having a K4 with one edge is to have the graph be a complete multipartite graph. For example, if the graph is tripartite with each partition of size 6, then any four vertices will either have all possible edges except those within the partitions. Wait, in a tripartite graph, there are no edges within each partition. So, a complete tripartite graph K6,6,6 would have edges only between different partitions. Then, any four vertices selected from different partitions would have a certain number of edges. Wait, in a tripartite graph, edges exist only between different partitions. So, if we take four vertices, they could be distributed among the partitions. For example, two in one partition and two in another. Then, the number of edges among them would be the edges between the two partitions. Since there are no edges within a partition, and edges between partitions. So, if two vertices are in one partition and two in another, the edges between them would form a complete bipartite graph K2,2, which has four edges. So, in this case, the four vertices have four edges among them. If four vertices are spread across three partitions, say two in one, one in another, and one in another, then the edges would be between the different partitions, resulting in a certain number of edges. Let&#39;s see: two in partition A, one in B, one in C. The edges would be between A and B (2*1=2 edges), A and C (2*1=2 edges), and B and C (1*1=1 edge). Total edges: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 edges. So in this case, a four-vertex subset could have five edges. However, in the original tripartite graph, there are no edges within the partitions, so in the four-vertex subsets, depending on their distribution across partitions, they can have different numbers of edges. The key is that in such a graph, you don&#39;t get any four-vertex subset with exactly one edge. So, a complete tripartite graph with partitions of equal size is an example of a graph that doesn&#39;t have a K4 with exactly one edge. The number of edges in such a graph is 3 * (6 choose 2) * 6 = Wait, no. Wait, a complete tripartite graph K6,6,6 has three partitions each of size 6, and every vertex in one partition is connected to every vertex in the other partitions. So the total number of edges is 3 * (6 * 6) + 3 * (6 * 6) = Wait, no, actually, each pair of partitions contributes 6*6 edges. There are three pairs of partitions: AB, AC, BC. Each contributes 6*6 = 36 edges. So total edges are 3*36 = 108 edges.So, a complete tripartite graph K6,6,6 has 108 edges and no K4 with exactly one edge. If we can construct such a graph, then the maximum number of edges without such a K4 is at least 108. But maybe there are graphs with more edges that still avoid K4 with one edge.But if we take a complete tripartite graph with partitions of size as equal as possible, which in this case is 6,6,6, since 18 divided by 3 is 6. If we make a complete four-partite graph, the number of edges would be higher? Wait, no. Wait, the more partitions you have, the fewer edges, because edges exist only between different partitions. So, tripartite is better for maximizing edges while avoiding certain subgraphs.But perhaps K6,6,6 is the extremal graph here. If that&#39;s the case, then the maximum number of edges without a K4 with exactly one edge is 108. Therefore, the minimal number of edges needed to force the existence of such a K4 is 109. Therefore, if our tournament has 9n edges, and 9n &gt; 108, then it must contain a K4 with one edge. Therefore, n ≥ 12 (since 9*12=108). Wait, but 108 edges would correspond to n=12. So, if n=12, the graph has 108 edges, which is exactly the number in the tripartite graph. Therefore, if n=12, it&#39;s possible to have a graph (the tripartite one) with 108 edges and no K4 with one edge. Therefore, the maximum n where in any n-round schedule there must exist a K4 with one edge would be 11, since at n=12, you can have a graph without such a K4.Wait, but this contradicts the answer I thought earlier. Maybe my reasoning is flawed here.Wait, the problem states that after n rounds, regardless of the schedule, there always exists such a group of 4 teams. Therefore, we need the maximal n such that every graph formed by n matchings contains a K4 with one edge. If the tripartite graph can be formed by 12 matchings (since 108 edges / 9 edges per round = 12 rounds), then for n=12, there exists a schedule (the tripartite one) where there is no such K4. Therefore, the maximum n where every schedule contains such a K4 is 11.But wait, the tripartite graph isn&#39;t a union of matchings. Each round is a perfect matching. The tripartite graph is a different structure. So perhaps the tripartite graph cannot be decomposed into perfect matchings? Wait, a complete tripartite graph K6,6,6 is a 12-regular graph (each vertex connected to 12 others). To decompose it into perfect matchings, we need 12 perfect matchings. But since the graph is tripartite, each perfect matching must consist of edges between the partitions. So, for example, each perfect matching would need to pair vertices from partition A with partition B, and partition C with whom? Wait, actually, in a tripartite graph with partitions A, B, C each of size 6, each perfect matching would need to pair each vertex in A with a vertex in B or C, but since all edges are between different partitions, you can form a perfect matching by taking a matching between A and B, and a matching between C and... but there are 6 vertices in C, and they need to be matched as well. Wait, but if you match A with B, then you need to match all of A with B, but there are 6 in A and 6 in B, so a perfect matching between A and B would use all 6 edges, but then partition C would need to be matched among themselves, which isn&#39;t allowed because there are no edges within partitions. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to decompose K6,6,6 into perfect matchings. Therefore, the tripartite graph cannot be formed by a collection of perfect matchings. Therefore, my previous approach is invalid.Therefore, maybe the extremal graph isn&#39;t the tripartite one, but another graph that can be decomposed into perfect matchings.Alternatively, think of the graph as being composed of multiple 1-factors (perfect matchings). So each round adds a 1-factor. Then, the question is to find the maximum n such that any union of n 1-factors contains a K4 with one edge. If we can find a 1-factorization (a decomposition into 17 1-factors) such that the first n 1-factors avoid creating a K4 with one edge, then n is possible. The maximum n we&#39;re seeking is the largest n where this avoidance is impossible.Alternatively, consider that in order to avoid a K4 with one edge, every four vertices must have 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 edges. So, in particular, in the graph formed by the n 1-factors, there is no four-vertex induced subgraph with exactly one edge. Therefore, we need to construct n 1-factors such that in their union, every four-vertex subset has 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 edges.Alternatively, perhaps think of this as a design where no four elements have exactly one block. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use the concept of girth or something else, but not sure.Wait, here&#39;s another approach. Let&#39;s model the problem as a hypergraph. Each 1-factor (round) is a 2-regular hypergraph. The union of n 1-factors is a 2n-regular graph. We want that in any such 2n-regular graph formed by n 1-factors, there exists a 4-vertex subset with exactly one edge.We need to find the maximal n where this is always true.Suppose that for n=7, any such union must contain a K4 with one edge, but for n=8, there exists a union that avoids it. Then the answer would be 7.But how to verify this?Perhaps use the following theorem: In any graph with m edges, there exists a 4-vertex subgraph with at most m * 12 / (v choose 2) edges. But not sure.Alternatively, apply the probabilistic method. For each 4-tuple, compute the probability that it has exactly one edge, then show that the expected number is positive, hence such a 4-tuple exists. But since the graph is formed deterministically, this might not apply.Alternatively, use counting. Count the number of 4-tuples and the number of possible edges.Total number of 4-tuples: C(18,4) = 3060.Each edge is in C(16,2) 4-tuples. Wait, each edge is part of (18-2 choose 2) = 16 choose 2 = 120 4-tuples.Total number of edges in the graph: 9n.Therefore, the total number of edge-4-tuples incidences is 9n * 120.The average number of edges per 4-tuple is (9n * 120) / 3060 = (1080n)/3060 = (108n)/306 = (12n)/34 ≈ 0.3529n.If we want this average to be at least 1, then 0.3529n ≥ 1 ⇒ n ≥ 2.83. But the average being 1 doesn&#39;t guarantee that some 4-tuples have exactly 1 edge. However, if the average is low, maybe some 4-tuples have below average.But this approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or variance to show that there must be some 4-tuples with one edge.Alternatively, use the fact that in a graph with m edges, the number of triangles is at least ... but again, not directly applicable.Alternatively, think of each team as a vertex and look at the number of common opponents. Wait, if two teams have played each other, they have a common set of opponents. Not sure.Alternatively, consider that if we have n rounds, each team has n opponents. For a given team, it has n edges. Now, consider the n opponents of team A. Each of these opponents has played n matches, one of which is against A. So, each of these opponents has n-1 other opponents. The question is whether among these opponents, there&#39;s a subset that have only played a certain number of matches among themselves.But this seems vague. Maybe use the pigeonhole principle on the number of matches among the neighbors of a vertex.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. For a given vertex A, it has n neighbors (teams it&#39;s played against) and 17 - n non-neighbors (teams it hasn&#39;t played yet). Among the n neighbors, each has played against A and n-1 other teams. If we can find three teams among the neighbors of A that have only played a small number of matches among themselves, then together with A, they might form the desired 4-team group.Alternatively, consider the n neighbors of A. Each pair of neighbors could have played against each other in some round. The number of possible edges among the neighbors is C(n,2). But each edge can be present at most once (since each pair plays only once). The total number of edges among the neighbors is at most C(n,2). However, since each neighbor has played n-1 matches (excluding the match against A), the total number of edges among the neighbors is (n(n-1))/2 - number of edges going outside. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, each neighbor of A has degree n (played n matches). One of those is against A, so the remaining n-1 are against other teams. If those n-1 are all within the neighbor set, then the number of edges among neighbors would be (n(n-1))/2. But since each edge is counted twice, the actual number is (n(n-1))/2 divided by 2? Wait, no. Wait, each edge is between two neighbors, so the total number of edges among neighbors is at most C(n,2). But each neighbor has n-1 edges to other teams, which could be inside or outside the neighbor set.So the total number of edges incident to the neighbor set (excluding edges to A) is n(n-1). But each edge among neighbors is counted twice (once for each endpoint), and edges from neighbors to non-neighbors are counted once. Let E be the number of edges among neighbors, and F be the number of edges from neighbors to non-neighbors. Then, 2E + F = n(n - 1). Also, the non-neighbors of A are 17 - n teams. So F is the number of edges from neighbors to non-neighbors, which is at most n(17 - n). Therefore, 2E + F = n(n - 1), and F ≤ n(17 - n). Therefore, 2E ≥ n(n - 1) - n(17 - n) = n^2 - n - 17n + n^2 = 2n^2 - 18n. Therefore, E ≥ n^2 - 9n.But E is the number of edges among the neighbors of A. So, the number of edges among the n neighbors is at least n^2 - 9n. But since the maximum possible number of edges among n neighbors is C(n,2) = (n(n - 1))/2. Therefore, we have:n^2 - 9n ≤ (n(n - 1))/2Multiply both sides by 2:2n^2 - 18n ≤ n^2 - nSubtract n^2 - n:n^2 - 17n ≤ 0Which implies n(n - 17) ≤ 0 ⇒ n ≤ 17. Which is always true, so this doesn&#39;t give us new information.Hmm. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t helpful.Wait, but if E ≥ n^2 - 9n, and the maximum possible E is C(n,2), then the average number of edges per pair among neighbors is at least (n^2 - 9n)/C(n,2) = (n^2 - 9n)/(n(n - 1)/2) = 2(n - 9)/(n - 1).If we set this average to be greater than or equal to 1, then:2(n - 9)/(n - 1) ≥ 1 ⇒ 2(n - 9) ≥ n - 1 ⇒ 2n - 18 ≥ n - 1 ⇒ n ≥ 17.Which is again trivial.Alternatively, if we consider that the number of edges among neighbors is E ≥ n² - 9n. So, if n² - 9n &gt; C(n,2), then we have a contradiction. But n² - 9n ≤ C(n,2) = (n² - n)/2 ⇒ 2n² - 18n ≤ n² - n ⇒ n² -17n ≤ 0 ⇒ n ≤17, which again is trivial.Alternatively, maybe use Turán&#39;s theorem on the neighbors. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of size r+1. If we consider the subgraph induced by the neighbors of A, which has E edges, then Turán&#39;s theorem says that if E &gt; (1 - 1/r)(n² / 2), then the subgraph contains a K_{r+1}.But I&#39;m not sure if this helps here. Our goal isn&#39;t to find a complete subgraph but to ensure that together with A, there&#39;s a 4-team group with only one edge.Alternatively, think of it this way: among the neighbors of A, if there are three teams that are mutually non-adjacent (i.e., forming an independent set of size 3), then those three teams plus A would form a 4-team group where A has played against none of them, but we need a group where only one match has been played. Not quite.Wait, if among the neighbors of A, there are two teams that haven&#39;t played each other, then together with A and another team, they might form a group with one edge. Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose among the neighbors of A, there are two teams B and C who haven&#39;t played each other. Then, the group A, B, C, D (where D is another team) might have only the edge A-B or A-C. But not sure.Alternatively, if in the neighbors of A, there exists a pair B and C who haven&#39;t played each other, then in the group A, B, C, the edge between B and C is missing. If they haven&#39;t played each other in the first n rounds, then in the total tournament, they will play each other in one of the remaining 17 - n rounds. But since we&#39;re only considering the first n rounds, the edge BC is missing. So, in the group A, B, C, we have edges AB and AC (assuming A played both B and C in the first n rounds), but BC hasn&#39;t been played yet. So, the number of edges among A, B, C is two. Then, we need a fourth team D such that... not sure.Alternatively, consider four teams where three of them are neighbors of A and one is a non-neighbor. Suppose A has played B, C, D in the first n rounds. Wait, no, A can only have played n teams. If three of them are B, C, D, then n must be at least 3. But this might not lead us anywhere.This approach seems too vague. Let me try to recall similar problems.The problem reminds me of the concept of unavoidable subgraphs in graph sequences. Each round adds a matching, and we need to find how many matchings force a certain subgraph.In the 2002 China Mathematical Olympiad problem, the answer is 7. So, likely, the maximum n is 7. But I need to justify this.Here&#39;s a possible approach using the pigeonhole principle:Consider that each team plays n matches. For a particular team, say Team A, it has n opponents. Let&#39;s call this set S. The other 17 - n teams are the ones Team A hasn&#39;t played yet, call this set T.Now, consider the matches between S and T. Each team in S has played n matches, one of which is against Team A, so they have n - 1 other matches.

It is easy to see that after 9 rounds, any two teams in the same group have already played against each other. Therefore, any 4 teams have already played at least 2 matches, which does not meet the requirements of the problem. If the above program is reversed and the matches are played in the new order, then after 8 rounds, any two teams in the same group have not played against each other. Each team has played one match against 8 of the 9 teams in the other group. At this point, any 4 teams in the same group have not played against each other, while any 4 teams not all in the same group have played at least 2 matches, which does not meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, ( n leqslant 7 ). When ( n = 7 ), assume that no 4 teams meet the requirements of the problem. Select 2 teams ( A_{1} ) and ( A_{2} ) that have already played against each other. Each team has played against 6 other teams, and the 2 teams have played against at most 12 other teams. Therefore, there are at least 4 teams ( B_{1} ), ( B_{2} ), ( B_{3} ), and ( B_{4} ) that have not played against ( A_{1} ) and ( A_{2} ). Consider the 4 teams ( A_{1} ), ( A_{2} ), ( B_{i} ), and ( B_{j} ) (1 leqslant i &lt; j leqslant 4). According to the assumption, they have played at least 2 matches, so for any 1 leqslant i &lt; j leqslant 4, ( B_{i} ) and ( B_{j} ) have played against each other. Since ( B_{1} ) and ( B_{2} ) have played 3 matches in ({B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}}), ( B_{1} ) and ( B_{2} ) have played 1 match against 4 of the 14 other teams, so there are at least 6 teams ( C_{1} ), ( C_{2} ), ( C_{3} ), ( C_{4} ), ( C_{5} ), and ( C_{6} ) that have not played against ( B_{1} ) and ( B_{2} ). Similarly, for any 1 leqslant i &lt; j leqslant 6, ( C_{i} ) and ( C_{j} ) have played against each other. Since ( C_{1} ) and ( C_{2} ) have played 5 matches in ({C_{1}, C_{2}, cdots, C_{6}}), ( C_{1} ) and ( C_{2} ) have played 1 match against 2 of the 12 other teams, so there are at least 8 teams ( D_{1} ), ( D_{2} ), (cdots), ( D_{8} ) that have not played against ( C_{1} ) and ( C_{2} ). Similarly, for any 1 leqslant i &lt; j leqslant 8, ( D_{i} ) and ( D_{j} ) have played against each other. Thus, ( D_{1} ) and ( D_{2} ) have not played against 10 other teams. Since only 7 rounds have been played, at least 2 teams ( E_{1} ) and ( E_{2} ) among the 10 other teams have not played against each other, so ( D_{1} ), ( D_{2} ), ( E_{1} ), and ( E_{2} ) have played only 1 match, which contradicts the assumption. In summary, the maximum possible value of ( n ) is 7.```</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2507025c data-v-94f6092c><div class="review" data-v-94f6092c><div class="review-title" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>❓:</span>Which family of elements has solid, liquid, and gaseous members at 25^{circ} text{C} and 1 text{atm} pressure? textbf{(A)}hspace{.05in}text{alkali metals (Li-Cs)} qquadtextbf{(B)}hspace{.05in}text{pnictogens (N-Bi)} qquadtextbf{(C)}hspace{.05in}text{chalcogens (O-Te)} qquadtextbf{(D)}hspace{.05in}text{halogens (F-I)}qquad</div><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The question is asking which family of elements has solid, liquid, and gaseous members at 25°C and 1 atm pressure. The options are alkali metals, pnictogens, chalcogens, and halogens. Hmm, I need to figure out which group has elements in all three states under standard conditions. First, let me recall the standard states of elements. At 25°C (which is about room temperature) and 1 atm (standard pressure), most elements are solids. Some are gases, like nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and the noble gases. Then there are a couple of liquids, like bromine and mercury. Wait, mercury is a metal, but it&#39;s a transition metal, not part of the main groups listed here. Bromine is a halogen, right? So bromine is liquid at room temperature. Then, chlorine is a gas, and iodine is a solid. So if we look at the halogens, fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is liquid, and iodine is solid. But wait, at 25°C, what about fluorine? Fluorine&#39;s melting point is like -219°C and boiling point is -188°C, so at room temperature it&#39;s definitely a gas. Chlorine&#39;s melting point is -101°C, boiling point is -34°C, so chlorine is a gas at 25°C. Bromine melts at -7°C and boils at 59°C, so at 25°C, it&#39;s a liquid. Iodine melts at 113°C, so it&#39;s a solid at room temperature. So the halogens (option D) have fluorine and chlorine as gases, bromine as liquid, and iodine as solid. So that&#39;s three states. But let me check the other options to be sure. Option A: alkali metals (Li to Cs). All alkali metals are solid at room temperature. Their melting points are relatively low for metals, but still way above 25°C. For example, lithium melts at 180°C, sodium at 98°C, potassium at 63°C, rubidium at 39°C, and cesium at 28°C. Wait, cesium&#39;s melting point is 28.5°C, which is just above room temperature. So at 25°C, cesium would still be a solid. So all alkali metals are solid. So this group doesn&#39;t have liquid or gaseous members at 25°C. So option A is out.Option B: pnictogens (N to Bi). The pnictogens are group 15: nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth. Nitrogen is a gas at room temperature (it&#39;s diatomic N₂). Phosphorus can be solid (different allotropes like white, red, black), arsenic is solid, antimony solid, bismuth solid. So in this group, nitrogen is gas, others are solids. So only two states. So no liquid here. So option B is out.Option C: chalcogens (O to Te). Group 16: oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium. Oxygen is a gas (O₂), sulfur is solid, selenium solid, tellurium solid. No liquid here. Wait, but what about ozone? No, ozone is an allotrope but not considered a different element. So chalcogens have oxygen as gas, others solid. So only two states. So option C is out.So the only group left is D: halogens. As discussed earlier, fluorine (gas), chlorine (gas), but wait, wait. Wait, bromine is liquid, chlorine and fluorine are gas, iodine is solid. So in the halogens, under standard conditions, you have gas (F, Cl), liquid (Br), and solid (I). So that&#39;s three states. Therefore, the answer should be D.But wait, let me double-check. Let me confirm the melting and boiling points. Fluorine (F₂): melting point -219.67°C, boiling point -188.11°C. So at 25°C, definitely gas.Chlorine (Cl₂): melting point -101.5°C, boiling point -34.04°C. At 25°C, gas.Bromine (Br₂): melting point -7.2°C, boiling point 58.8°C. So at 25°C, which is between -7.2 and 58.8, so it&#39;s liquid.Iodine (I₂): melting point 113.7°C, so at 25°C, solid.Astatine is also a halogen, but it&#39;s radioactive and not naturally occurring in significant quantities. So the common halogens are F, Cl, Br, I. And among these, at room temp, F and Cl are gases, Br is liquid, I is solid. So yes, D is the correct answer.Other options: Alkali metals are all solid (even Cs is just barely solid at 25°C, but cesium&#39;s melting point is 28.5°C, so at 25°C, it&#39;s solid). Pnictogens: N is gas, others solid. Chalcogens: O is gas, others solid. So only halogens have all three states. So the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which family of elements has solid, liquid, and gaseous members at (25^circ text{C}) and (1 text{atm}) pressure, we analyze the standard states of each group:- Alkali metals (Li-Cs): All are solid at (25^circ text{C}). Even cesium, with a melting point of (28.5^circ text{C}), is solid at (25^circ text{C}). - Pnictogens (N-Bi): Nitrogen is a gas, while phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are solids. No liquid members.- Chalcogens (O-Te): Oxygen is a gas, while sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are solids. No liquid members.- Halogens (F-I): Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. For the halogens:- Fluorine (gas): Melting point (-219.67^circ text{C}), boiling point (-188.11^circ text{C})- Chlorine (gas): Melting point (-101.5^circ text{C}), boiling point (-34.04^circ text{C})- Bromine (liquid): Melting point (-7.2^circ text{C}), boiling point (58.8^circ text{C})- Iodine (solid): Melting point (113.7^circ text{C})Thus, the halogens (option D) have members in all three states at (25^circ text{C}) and (1 text{atm}).(boxed{D}),&lt;think&gt;Alright, so the question is asking which family of elements has solid, liquid, and gaseous members at 25°C and 1 atm pressure. The options are alkali metals, pnictogens, chalcogens, and halogens. Let me think through this step by step.First, I need to recall the standard states (solid, liquid, gas) of the elements in each family at room temperature (25°C) and standard pressure (1 atm). Each family is a group in the periodic table, so they share similar properties, but their physical states can vary depending on the element&#39;s atomic weight and structure.Let&#39;s go through each option one by one.Option A: Alkali metals (Li-Cs)Alkali metals include Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Cesium (Cs), and Francium (Fr). All of these are metals. At room temperature, metals are typically solid. Let me confirm. Lithium, sodium, potassium—all definitely solids at 25°C. Even cesium, which has a relatively low melting point for a metal, melts at about 28.5°C. Wait, so at 25°C, cesium is solid, but if the temperature were just a bit higher, it would melt. But the question specifies 25°C, so cesium is solid. Francium is radioactive and not naturally occurring, but regardless, all alkali metals here are solids at 25°C. So this family only has solid members. Therefore, Option A can&#39;t be the answer because they don&#39;t have liquid or gaseous members under these conditions.Option B: Pnictogens (N-Bi)Pnictogens are group 15 elements: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Bismuth (Bi). Let&#39;s check their states. Nitrogen is a diatomic gas at room temperature. Phosphorus can be solid (various allotropes like white, red, etc.), all of which are solid. Arsenic is solid, Antimony is solid, Bismuth is solid. So in this group, Nitrogen is a gas, and the rest are solids. So we have gas and solid, but no liquid. So B has two states. Not the answer we&#39;re looking for, since we need three states.Option C: Chalcogens (O-Te)Chalcogens are group 16: Oxygen (O), Sulfur (S), Selenium (Se), Tellurium (Te), and maybe Polonium (Po). Oxygen is a diatomic gas at room temperature. Sulfur is solid, selenium is solid, tellurium is solid, polonium is solid (and radioactive). So again, gas and solid, but no liquid. So Option C also only has two states. So this isn&#39;t the answer either.Option D: Halogens (F-I)Halogens are group 17: Fluorine (F), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Iodine (I), Astatine (At). Let&#39;s check their states. Fluorine is a diatomic gas at room temperature. Chlorine is also a gas. Wait, hold on. Wait, chlorine is a gas, bromine is liquid, and iodine is solid. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Fluorine (F2): Melting point is -219.67°C, boiling point -188.11°C. So at 25°C, fluorine is gas.Chlorine (Cl2): Melting point -101.5°C, boiling point -34.04°C. So at 25°C, chlorine is gas as well. Hmm, wait. Wait, bromine (Br2) has a melting point of -7.2°C and boiling point of 58.8°C. So at 25°C, bromine is a liquid. Iodine (I2) has a melting point of 113.7°C, so at 25°C, it&#39;s a solid. Astatine is a solid but radioactive. So in the halogen family, fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. So at 25°C and 1 atm, halogens have all three states: solid (iodine), liquid (bromine), and gas (chlorine and fluorine). Wait, but wait, chlorine is a gas. So the family includes fluorine (gas), chlorine (gas), bromine (liquid), iodine (solid). So yes, they have solid, liquid, and gas members. So this would be the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Some sources might say bromine is the only liquid non-metal at room temperature. So fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is liquid, iodine solid. So indeed, three states. So halogens have all three. So option D is the answer.But wait, let me check the other options again to make sure I didn&#39;t miss any. Rechecking Option B: PnictogensNitrogen is gas, others solid. No liquid. So no.Rechecking Option C: ChalcogensOxygen is gas, others solid. No liquid. So no.Rechecking Option A: Alkali metalsAll solid. Cesium is solid at 25°C (melting point 28.5°C, close, but still solid at 25). So no.Therefore, the correct answer is D: Halogens.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which family of elements has solid, liquid, and gaseous members at (25^circ text{C}) and (1 text{atm}) pressure, we analyze the standard states of elements in each given family:1. Alkali Metals (Li-Cs): All members (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) are solids at (25^circ text{C}). Even cesium, with a melting point of (28.5^circ text{C}), is solid at (25^circ text{C}). No liquid or gaseous members.2. Pnictogens (N-Bi): Nitrogen (N) is a gas, while others (P, As, Sb, Bi) are solids. No liquid members.3. Chalcogens (O-Te): Oxygen (O) is a gas, while others (S, Se, Te) are solids. No liquid members.4. Halogens (F-I): Fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) are gases, bromine (Br) is a liquid, and iodine (I) is a solid at (25^circ text{C}). This family includes all three states.Thus, the halogens (group 17) have solid, liquid, and gaseous members under the given conditions.[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>1.

So, we have a sequence where each term is the previous term plus the sum of its digits. We need to find the greatest possible n such that a_n can be 2008. Hmm, interesting. Let me think.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The sequence starts with some positive integer a_1, then each subsequent term is generated by adding the sum of the digits of the previous term. So, a_2 = a_1 + s(a_1), a_3 = a_2 + s(a_2), and so on. We need to find the maximum n where a_n = 2008. That means we need to work backwards from 2008 to see how long of a sequence we can create before we can&#39;t go back any further. Because working forwards would require guessing the starting number, which might not be efficient.So, maybe reverse engineering the sequence from 2008? Let me try that. If a_n = 2008, then a_{n-1} must be a number such that when you add the sum of its digits, you get 2008. Therefore, a_{n-1} = 2008 - s(a_{n-1}). The problem here is that a_{n-1} is on both sides of the equation. So, how do we find possible candidates for a_{n-1}?Let me denote x = a_{n-1}. Then x + s(x) = 2008. So, x = 2008 - s(x). Since s(x) is the sum of the digits of x, which is at least 1 (since x is a positive integer) and at most 9 * number of digits of x. Let&#39;s see. If x is, say, a 4-digit number, then the maximum s(x) is 9*4=36. So, x = 2008 - s(x). Therefore, x must be 2008 - s(x), which is roughly 2008 minus something between 1 and 36. So x is between 2008 - 36 = 1972 and 2008 - 1 = 2007.So, possible x values are between 1972 and 2007. But we need to check for each x in this range if x + s(x) = 2008. Let&#39;s test some numbers.Take x = 2008 - s(x). Let&#39;s try x = 2008 - s(2008). Wait, s(2008) is 2 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 10. So, 2008 - 10 = 1998. Let&#39;s check if 1998 + s(1998) = 1998 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 1998 + 27 = 2025, which is not 2008. So that&#39;s not valid. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through numbers from 1972 to 2007 and check if x + s(x) = 2008. Let&#39;s try some.Starting from the upper bound, x = 2007: s(2007) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 = 9. So, 2007 + 9 = 2016 ≠ 2008. Not valid.x = 2006: s(x) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 8. 2006 + 8 = 2014 ≠ 2008.x = 2005: s(x) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7. 2005 + 7 = 2012 ≠ 2008.x = 2000: s(x) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2. 2000 + 2 = 2002 ≠ 2008.x = 1999: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28. 1999 + 28 = 2027 ≠ 2008.Hmm, maybe try lower numbers. Let&#39;s try x = 1980: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 0 = 18. 1980 + 18 = 1998 ≠ 2008.x = 1985: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 23. 1985 + 23 = 2008. Oh! That works. So x = 1985 is a candidate. Let&#39;s check: 1985 + 1+9+8+5 = 1985 + 23 = 2008. Yes, correct.So, a_{n-1} could be 1985. Are there other numbers in the range 1972-2007 that also satisfy x + s(x) = 2008?Let&#39;s check another one. Let&#39;s try x = 1976: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 23. 1976 + 23 = 1999 ≠ 2008.x = 1979: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 26. 1979 + 26 = 2005 ≠ 2008.x = 1982: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 2 = 20. 1982 + 20 = 2002 ≠ 2008.x = 1983: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 3 = 21. 1983 + 21 = 2004 ≠ 2008.x = 1984: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 22. 1984 + 22 = 2006 ≠ 2008.x = 1985: Already found that works.x = 1986: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 6 = 24. 1986 + 24 = 2010 ≠ 2008.x = 1987: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 25. 1987 + 25 = 2012 ≠ 2008.x = 1980: Already checked.x = 1990: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 19. 1990 + 19 = 2009 ≠ 2008.x = 1991: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 20. 1991 + 20 = 2011 ≠ 2008.x = 1993: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 22. 1993 + 22 = 2015 ≠ 2008.x = 1994: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 23. 1994 + 23 = 2017 ≠ 2008.Wait, maybe trying numbers in the 1980s. Let&#39;s check x = 1973: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20. 1973 + 20 = 1993 ≠ 2008.x = 1970: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 0 = 17. 1970 + 17 = 1987 ≠ 2008.Hmm, perhaps only x = 1985 works in this range? Let&#39;s check x = 1985 again. 1985 + 23 = 2008. Correct. So, a_{n-1} could be 1985. Then, to find a_{n-2}, we need to find x such that x + s(x) = 1985. Then repeat this process until we can&#39;t go back further. The goal is to make the sequence as long as possible, so we need to find the longest possible chain from some starting number up to 2008.But perhaps there are multiple predecessors for each term? For example, maybe 2008 has multiple numbers that can reach it in one step. But in this case, we found only 1985 so far. Wait, let me check another number. x = 1967: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 23. 1967 + 23 = 1990 ≠ 2008. x = 1972: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 2 = 19. 1972 + 19 = 1991 ≠ 2008.Wait, maybe I need a better approach than brute-forcing. Let me think. The key is that for each term a_{k}, its predecessor is a_{k-1} = a_k - s(a_{k-1}). So, to find all possible predecessors, given a_k, we need to find all x such that x + s(x) = a_k. So, x = a_k - s(x). Since s(x) is positive, x must be less than a_k.But x must also be such that when you subtract the sum of its digits from a_k, you get x itself. So, it&#39;s a bit of a catch-22 because s(x) depends on x.But perhaps we can bound s(x). For numbers x in the range [a_k - 9*d, a_k - 1], where d is the number of digits of a_k. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think.If x is close to a_k, say within 100, then the sum of digits s(x) is at most, say, 36 for a 4-digit number. So, x must be in [a_k - 36, a_k - 1]. For a_k = 2008, x is in [1972, 2007]. So, we need to check all numbers in that range and see which ones satisfy x + s(x) = 2008.But checking each number manually is tedious. Maybe we can find some patterns.Note that x and x + s(x) = 2008. Let&#39;s denote s(x) = 2008 - x. Therefore, the sum of the digits of x is equal to 2008 - x. So, if we can write s(x) = 2008 - x, then x + s(x) = 2008.Therefore, for each x in [1972, 2007], compute s(x) and check if s(x) = 2008 - x.So, let&#39;s formalize this:For x from 1972 to 2007:If s(x) = 2008 - x, then x is a predecessor.So, let&#39;s compute 2008 - x for x in that range, and check if it equals s(x).But since x is 4-digit, let&#39;s denote x as &#39;abcd&#39; where a=1 or 2. Wait, since x is between 1972 and 2007, x is either 19ab, 20ab.So, for x from 1972 to 1999:x = 19ab, where ab ranges from 72 to 99.For x from 2000 to 2007:x = 20ab, where ab is from 00 to 07.Let me first check x from 2000 to 2007:Take x = 2000: s(x) = 2; 2008 - x = 8. Not equal.x = 2001: s(x) = 3; 2008 - x = 7. Not equal.x = 2002: s(x) = 4; 2008 - x = 6. Not equal.x = 2003: s(x) = 5; 2008 - x = 5. Wait, 2003: s(x) = 2 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 5. 2008 - 2003 = 5. So, 5 = 5. Therefore, x = 2003 is another predecessor!Wait, that&#39;s in the 2000s. Let me check: 2003 + s(2003) = 2003 + 5 = 2008. Yes! So, x = 2003 is also a predecessor. So, that&#39;s another one.Similarly, check x = 2004: s(x) = 6; 2008 - x = 4. Not equal.x = 2005: s(x) = 7; 2008 - x = 3. Not equal.x = 2006: s(x) = 8; 2008 - x = 2. Not equal.x = 2007: s(x) = 9; 2008 - x = 1. Not equal.So, in the 2000-2007 range, only x = 2003 works. Now check x from 1972 to 1999.For x in 1972-1999:Let&#39;s take x = 1985: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 23; 2008 - x = 2008 - 1985 = 23. So that&#39;s the one we found earlier.Another one: Let&#39;s check x = 1973: 2008 - 1973 = 35. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20 ≠ 35.x = 1979: 2008 - 1979 = 29. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 26 ≠ 29.x = 1984: 2008 - 1984 = 24. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 = 22 ≠ 24.x = 1985: s(x) = 23, 2008 - x = 23. That&#39;s good.x = 1986: s(x) = 24, 2008 - x = 22 ≠ 24.x = 1990: s(x) = 19, 2008 - x = 18 ≠ 19.x = 1991: s(x) = 20, 2008 - x = 17 ≠ 20.x = 1976: 2008 - 1976 = 32; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 6 = 23 ≠ 32.x = 1983: 2008 - 1983 = 25; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 3 = 21 ≠ 25.x = 1970: Not in the range. Wait, our range starts at 1972.Wait, maybe there&#39;s another x. Let me check x = 1993: 2008 - 1993 = 15; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 22 ≠ 15.x = 1987: 2008 - 1987 = 21; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 25 ≠ 21.x = 1982: 2008 - 1982 = 26; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 2 = 20 ≠ 26.x = 1996: 2008 - 1996 = 12; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 6 = 25 ≠ 12.x = 1975: 2008 - 1975 = 33; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 22 ≠ 33.x = 1988: 2008 - 1988 = 20; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 26 ≠ 20.x = 1998: 2008 - 1998 = 10; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 27 ≠ 10.x = 1989: 2008 - 1989 = 19; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 27 ≠ 19.x = 1977: 2008 - 1977 = 31; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 24 ≠ 31.x = 1981: 2008 - 1981 = 27; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 19 ≠ 27.Hmm, seems like only x = 1985 and x = 2003 are predecessors of 2008. Let me confirm once again.Wait, x = 1994: 2008 - 1994 = 14; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 4 = 23 ≠ 14.x = 1995: 2008 - 1995 = 13; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24 ≠ 13.x = 1997: 2008 - 1997 = 11; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 7 = 26 ≠ 11.x = 1992: 2008 - 1992 = 16; s(x) = 1 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 21 ≠ 16.x = 1985 and x = 2003. So, two predecessors. So, for a_n = 2008, a_{n-1} can be either 1985 or 2003. Therefore, to get the longest possible sequence, we need to choose the predecessor that allows the longest chain going backwards. So, which one gives a longer chain: 1985 or 2003?Let me explore both possibilities.First, let&#39;s take the path through 2003. Then, a_{n-1} = 2003. Then, we need to find a_{n-2} such that a_{n-2} + s(a_{n-2}) = 2003. Similarly, we can apply the same reasoning.So, for x + s(x) = 2003. Then, x = 2003 - s(x). The possible range for x is from 2003 - 36 = 1967 to 2003 - 1 = 2002. Let&#39;s check in that range.x is between 1967 and 2002. Let&#39;s check possible candidates.Again, let&#39;s check if x = 2003 - s(x). Let&#39;s try x = 1985 again. Wait, x in this case would be different. Let&#39;s see:First, let&#39;s check x = 2003 - s(x). Let&#39;s check x = 1982: s(x) = 1 + 9 + 8 + 2 = 20. x + s(x) = 1982 + 20 = 2002. Not 2003.x = 1984: s(x) = 22. 1984 + 22 = 2006 ≠ 2003.x = 1985: s(x)=23. 1985 +23=2008. Not 2003.x = 1979: s(x)=26. 1979 +26=2005≠2003.x = 1981: s(x)=19. 1981 +19=2000≠2003.x = 1990: s(x)=19. 1990 +19=2009≠2003.x = 1993: s(x)=22. 1993 +22=2015≠2003.x = 2000: s(x)=2. 2000 +2=2002≠2003.x = 2001: s(x)=3. 2001 +3=2004≠2003.x = 2002: s(x)=4. 2002 +4=2006≠2003.x = 1996: s(x)=25. 1996 +25=2021≠2003.x = 1988: s(x)=26. 1988 +26=2014≠2003.Hmm, maybe trying x = 1976: s(x)=23. 1976 +23=1999≠2003.Wait, perhaps x = 1987: s(x)=25. 1987 +25=2012≠2003.x = 1970: Not in the range.x = 1975: s(x)=22. 1975 +22=1997≠2003.x = 1983: s(x)=21. 1983 +21=2004≠2003.x = 1978: s(x)=25. 1978 +25=2003. Wait, x = 1978: s(x)=1 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 25. 1978 +25=2003. Yes! So, x = 1978 is a predecessor of 2003.So, a_{n-2} could be 1978.Check: 1978 + 25 = 2003. Correct. So, that&#39;s another term. So, now, in the path through 2003, we can go back to 1978. Then, need to find predecessors of 1978.Similarly, let&#39;s find x such that x + s(x) = 1978. So, x = 1978 - s(x). The range for x is 1978 - 36 = 1942 to 1977.Check x in 1942 to 1977.Let me try some numbers:x = 1952: s(x)=1+9+5+2=17. 1952 +17=1969≠1978.x = 1960: s(x)=16. 1960 +16=1976≠1978.x = 1963: s(x)=1+9+6+3=19. 1963 +19=1982≠1978.x = 1969: s(x)=25. 1969 +25=1994≠1978.x = 1955: s(x)=20. 1955 +20=1975≠1978.x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1957 +22=1979≠1978.x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1949 +23=1972≠1978.x = 1958: s(x)=23. 1958 +23=1981≠1978.x = 1967: s(x)=23. 1967 +23=1990≠1978.x = 1970: s(x)=17. 1970 +17=1987≠1978.x = 1973: s(x)=20. 1973 +20=1993≠1978.x = 1976: s(x)=23. 1976 +23=1999≠1978.x = 1975: s(x)=22. 1975 +22=1997≠1978.x = 1972: s(x)=19. 1972 +19=1991≠1978.x = 1959: s(x)=24. 1959 +24=1983≠1978.x = 1943: s(x)=1+9+4+3=17. 1943 +17=1960≠1978.x = 1945: s(x)=19. 1945 +19=1964≠1978.x = 1954: s(x)=19. 1954 +19=1973≠1978.x = 1951: s(x)=16. 1951 +16=1967≠1978.Hmm, this is tedious. Let me think of another approach. Let&#39;s consider that x = 1978 - s(x). Let me let s(x) = 1978 - x. So, the sum of the digits of x is equal to 1978 - x. Therefore, x + s(x) = 1978.So, for x in 1942 to 1977, s(x) = 1978 - x. Let&#39;s check x = 1952: 1978 - 1952 = 26. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 17 ≠ 26.x = 1960: 1978 - 1960 = 18. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 6 + 0 = 16 ≠ 18.x = 1966: 1978 - 1966 = 12. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 6 + 6 = 22 ≠ 12.x = 1955: 1978 - 1955 = 23. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 20 ≠ 23.x = 1949: 1978 - 1949 = 29. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 4 + 9 = 23 ≠ 29.x = 1946: 1978 - 1946 = 32. s(x) = 1 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 20 ≠ 32.x = 1937: Not in the range.Wait, x must be at least 1942. x = 1942: s(x)=1+9+4+2=16. 1978 - 1942=36. 16≠36.x = 1943: s(x)=17. 1978 -1943=35. 17≠35.x = 1944: s(x)=18. 1978 -1944=34. 18≠34.x = 1945: s(x)=19. 1978 -1945=33. 19≠33.x = 1946: s(x)=20. 1978 -1946=32. 20≠32.x = 1947: s(x)=21. 1978 -1947=31. 21≠31.x = 1948: s(x)=22. 1978 -1948=30. 22≠30.x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1978 -1949=29. 23≠29.x = 1950: s(x)=15. 1978 -1950=28. 15≠28.x = 1951: s(x)=16. 1978 -1951=27. 16≠27.x = 1952: s(x)=17. 1978 -1952=26. 17≠26.x = 1953: s(x)=18. 1978 -1953=25. 18≠25.x = 1954: s(x)=19. 1978 -1954=24. 19≠24.x = 1955: s(x)=20. 1978 -1955=23. 20≠23.x = 1956: s(x)=21. 1978 -1956=22. 21≠22.x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1978 -1957=21. 22≠21.x = 1958: s(x)=23. 1978 -1958=20. 23≠20.x = 1959: s(x)=24. 1978 -1959=19. 24≠19.x = 1960: s(x)=16. 1978 -1960=18. 16≠18.x = 1961: s(x)=17. 1978 -1961=17. 17=17. So, x = 1961. Check: 1961 + s(1961) = 1961 + 1 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 1961 +17=1978. Yes! So, x = 1961 is a predecessor of 1978.So, a_{n-2} = 1961. Then, we need to find predecessors of 1961.So, x + s(x) = 1961. Then x = 1961 - s(x). The range for x is 1961 - 36 = 1925 to 1960.Check x in 1925 to 1960.Again, let&#39;s let s(x) = 1961 - x.For x in this range:x = 1961 - s(x). Let&#39;s check for example x = 1942: s(x)=1+9+4+2=16. 1961 -1942=19. 16≠19.x = 1933: s(x)=1+9+3+3=16. 1961 -1933=28. 16≠28.x = 1945: s(x)=1+9+4+5=19. 1961 -1945=16. 19≠16.x = 1939: s(x)=1+9+3+9=22. 1961 -1939=22. 22=22. So, x = 1939. Check: 1939 + s(1939)=1939 +22=1961. Yes! Therefore, x = 1939 is a predecessor.So, a_{n-3} = 1939. Now, predecessors of 1939.x + s(x) = 1939. x = 1939 - s(x). Range: 1939 - 36 = 1903 to 1938.Check x in 1903 to 1938.s(x) = 1939 - x.Let&#39;s see. For example:x = 1916: s(x)=1+9+1+6=17. 1939 -1916=23. 17≠23.x = 1922: s(x)=1+9+2+2=14. 1939 -1922=17. 14≠17.x = 1919: s(x)=1+9+1+9=20. 1939 -1919=20. 20=20. So, x = 1919. Check: 1919 +20=1939. Correct.Therefore, a_{n-4} = 1919. Predecessors of 1919.x + s(x) = 1919. x = 1919 - s(x). Range: 1919 - 36 = 1883 to 1918.Check x in 1883 to 1918.s(x) = 1919 - x.Let&#39;s try x = 1900: s(x)=10. 1919 -1900=19. 10≠19.x = 1898: s(x)=1+8+9+8=26. 1919 -1898=21. 26≠21.x = 1892: s(x)=1+8+9+2=20. 1919 -1892=27. 20≠27.x = 1903: s(x)=13. 1919 -1903=16. 13≠16.x = 1895: s(x)=23. 1919 -1895=24. 23≠24.x = 1889: s(x)=26. 1919 -1889=30. 26≠30.x = 1886: s(x)=23. 1919 -1886=33. 23≠33.x = 1909: s(x)=19. 1919 -1909=10. 19≠10.x = 1912: s(x)=13. 1919 -1912=7. 13≠7.x = 1918: s(x)=19. 1919 -1918=1. 19≠1.Wait, maybe x = 1897: s(x)=1+8+9+7=25. 1919 -1897=22. 25≠22.x = 1891: s(x)=1+8+9+1=19. 1919 -1891=28. 19≠28.x = 1883: s(x)=1+8+8+3=20. 1919 -1883=36. 20≠36.x = 1906: s(x)=16. 1919 -1906=13. 16≠13.x = 1894: s(x)=22. 1919 -1894=25. 22≠25.x = 1896: s(x)=24. 1919 -1896=23. 24≠23.x = 1907: s(x)=17. 1919 -1907=12. 17≠12.x = 1885: s(x)=22. 1919 -1885=34. 22≠34.Hmm, not finding a predecessor. Maybe try x = 1901: s(x)=11. 1919 -1901=18. 11≠18.x = 1902: s(x)=12. 1919 -1902=17. 12≠17.x = 1910: s(x)=11. 1919 -1910=9. 11≠9.x = 1915: s(x)=16. 1919 -1915=4. 16≠4.x = 1914: s(x)=15. 1919 -1914=5. 15≠5.x = 1887: s(x)=24. 1919 -1887=32. 24≠32.Wait, maybe there&#39;s no predecessor here. If that&#39;s the case, then the chain starting from 1919 can&#39;t go further back. So, the path through 2003 -&gt; 1978 -&gt; 1961 -&gt; 1939 -&gt; 1919 ends here. So, length from 1919 to 2008 is 5 terms: 1919, 1939, 1961, 1978, 2003, 2008. So n=6.But let&#39;s check the other path, the one through 1985. So, 2008 &lt;- 1985. Then, find predecessors of 1985.So, x + s(x) = 1985. x = 1985 - s(x). The range for x is 1985 - 36 = 1949 to 1984.Check x in 1949 to 1984.Again, let&#39;s let s(x) = 1985 - x.Check some numbers:x = 1969: s(x)=1+9+6+9=25. 1985 -1969=16. 25≠16.x = 1970: s(x)=17. 1985 -1970=15. 17≠15.x = 1972: s(x)=19. 1985 -1972=13. 19≠13.x = 1963: s(x)=19. 1985 -1963=22. 19≠22.x = 1958: s(x)=23. 1985 -1958=27. 23≠27.x = 1955: s(x)=20. 1985 -1955=30. 20≠30.x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1985 -1949=36. 23≠36.x = 1976: s(x)=23. 1985 -1976=9. 23≠9.x = 1984: s(x)=21. 1985 -1984=1. 21≠1.x = 1980: s(x)=18. 1985 -1980=5. 18≠5.x = 1975: s(x)=22. 1985 -1975=10. 22≠10.x = 1966: s(x)=22. 1985 -1966=19. 22≠19.x = 1950: s(x)=15. 1985 -1950=35. 15≠35.x = 1959: s(x)=24. 1985 -1959=26. 24≠26.x = 1960: s(x)=16. 1985 -1960=25. 16≠25.x = 1967: s(x)=23. 1985 -1967=18. 23≠18.x = 1978: s(x)=25. 1985 -1978=7. 25≠7.Wait, maybe x = 1969: already checked. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s try x = 1952: s(x)=17. 1985 -1952=33. 17≠33.x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1985 -1949=36. 23≠36.x = 1954: s(x)=19. 1985 -1954=31. 19≠31.x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1985 -1957=28. 22≠28.x = 1962: s(x)=18. 1985 -1962=23. 18≠23.x = 1964: s(x)=20. 1985 -1964=21. 20≠21.x = 1965: s(x)=21. 1985 -1965=20. 21≠20.x = 1968: s(x)=23. 1985 -1968=17. 23≠17.x = 1973: s(x)=20. 1985 -1973=12. 20≠12.x = 1979: s(x)=26. 1985 -1979=6. 26≠6.x = 1981: s(x)=19. 1985 -1981=4. 19≠4.Hmm, not finding a predecessor here. Maybe try another approach. Let&#39;s suppose s(x) = 1985 - x. So, sum of digits of x is 1985 - x.Let me try x = 1970: 1985 -1970=15. s(x) =1+9+7+0=17≠15.x = 1976: 1985 -1976=9. s(x)=1+9+7+6=23≠9.x = 1967: 1985 -1967=18. s(x)=1+9+6+7=23≠18.x = 1958: 1985 -1958=27. s(x)=1+9+5+8=23≠27.Wait, maybe x = 1946: 1985 -1946=39. s(x)=1+9+4+6=20≠39.No luck here. Maybe there is no predecessor for 1985, meaning that the path starting from 1985 can&#39;t go further back. Therefore, the chain would be 1985 -&gt; 2008, which is only two terms. So n=2.Comparing both paths: through 2003, we have a chain of 6 terms: 1919, 1939, 1961, 1978, 2003, 2008. Through 1985, only 1985, 2008. Therefore, the longest possible n is 6. But wait, maybe there are other predecessors that we missed? Let me check again for 1985.Wait, perhaps x = 1940: s(x)=1+9+4+0=14. 1985 -1940=45. 14≠45.x = 1922: Not in the range.Wait, the range is 1949 to 1984.Wait, x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1985 -1957=28. 22≠28.x = 1974: s(x)=21. 1985 -1974=11. 21≠11.x = 1982: s(x)=20. 1985 -1982=3. 20≠3.x = 1977: s(x)=24. 1985 -1977=8. 24≠8.x = 1960: s(x)=16. 1985 -1960=25. 16≠25.Hmm, maybe there&#39;s no predecessor for 1985. Then, that path is only length 2. So, the other path through 2003 gives us a longer sequence. But wait, let&#39;s check if there are multiple predecessors for each term.For example, when we were at 1978, we found x = 1961. But are there other predecessors of 1978? Let me check.x + s(x) = 1978. So, x = 1978 - s(x). Range is 1942 to 1977.Earlier, we found x = 1961. Let me check another one.x = 1952: s(x)=17. 1978 -1952=26. 17≠26.x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1978 -1949=29. 23≠29.x = 1955: s(x)=20. 1978 -1955=23. 20≠23.x = 1963: s(x)=19. 1978 -1963=15. 19≠15.x = 1969: s(x)=25. 1978 -1969=9. 25≠9.x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1978 -1957=21. 22≠21.x = 1970: s(x)=17. 1978 -1970=8. 17≠8.x = 1943: s(x)=1+9+4+3=17. 1978 -1943=35. 17≠35.So, seems like only x = 1961 is a predecessor for 1978. Similarly, when we went back from 1961, we found x = 1939. Let&#39;s check if 1939 has any other predecessors.x + s(x) = 1939. So, x = 1939 - s(x). Range is 1903 to 1938.Earlier, we found x = 1919. Let me check another.x = 1925: s(x)=1+9+2+5=17. 1939 -1925=14. 17≠14.x = 1930: s(x)=13. 1939 -1930=9. 13≠9.x = 1922: s(x)=1+9+2+2=14. 1939 -1922=17. 14≠17.x = 1910: s(x)=11. 1939 -1910=29. 11≠29.x = 1903: s(x)=13. 1939 -1903=36. 13≠36.x = 1915: s(x)=16. 1939 -1915=24. 16≠24.x = 1933: s(x)=16. 1939 -1933=6. 16≠6.x = 1936: s(x)=19. 1939 -1936=3. 19≠3.So, only x = 1919 is a predecessor for 1939. Then, moving to 1919, we couldn&#39;t find a predecessor, so that&#39;s the start. So, chain is 1919, 1939, 1961, 1978, 2003, 2008. Total of 6 terms, so n=6.But maybe there&#39;s another path with more terms. Let&#39;s check if 2008 has any other predecessors besides 1985 and 2003.Earlier, we found x = 1985 and x = 2003. Wait, wait, actually, when I checked x = 2003, s(x)=5, and 2003 +5=2008, which is correct. But in the earlier check of x from 1972 to 2007, we found x=1985 and x=2003. Let me confirm if there are others.Wait, let&#39;s check x = 1990: 1990 +19=2009≠2008.x = 1984: 1984 +22=2006≠2008.x = 1986: 1986 +24=2010≠2008.x = 1996: 1996 +25=2021≠2008.x = 1979: 1979 +26=2005≠2008.So, only two predecessors: 1985 and 2003.Therefore, the two possible paths. As the path through 2003 gives a longer sequence, we need to check if there are other branches in that path that could lead to longer sequences. But in our previous exploration, each step only had one predecessor. Let me confirm.Starting from 2008:1. 2008 &lt;- 1985 (path length 2)2. 2008 &lt;- 2003 &lt;- 1978 &lt;- 1961 &lt;- 1939 &lt;- 1919 (path length 6)But maybe there are other branches in the second path. For example, when we had a_{n-2} = 1978, which came from 1961. Could 1978 have another predecessor?As we saw earlier, for x + s(x) = 1978, only x = 1961 worked. So, no. Similarly, 1961 only had x = 1939. 1939 only had x = 1919, and 1919 had no predecessors. Therefore, that path is fixed. So, the maximum n is 6.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a different path altogether? Let me check.Suppose we consider that maybe when moving from 2008 to predecessors, we have two options: 1985 and 2003. We took 2003, but if we take 1985, maybe there&#39;s a way to have a longer path through 1985.But earlier, we saw that 1985 has no predecessors. But let me check again.Looking for x such that x + s(x) = 1985. x is in [1949, 1984].Wait, maybe x = 1949: s(x)=23. 1985 -1949=36. 23≠36.x = 1950: s(x)=15. 1985 -1950=35. 15≠35.x = 1951: s(x)=16. 1985 -1951=34. 16≠34.x = 1952: s(x)=17. 1985 -1952=33. 17≠33.x = 1953: s(x)=18. 1985 -1953=32. 18≠32.x = 1954: s(x)=19. 1985 -1954=31. 19≠31.x = 1955: s(x)=20. 1985 -1955=30. 20≠30.x = 1956: s(x)=21. 1985 -1956=29. 21≠29.x = 1957: s(x)=22. 1985 -1957=28. 22≠28.x = 1958: s(x)=23. 1985 -1958=27. 23≠27.x = 1959: s(x)=24. 1985 -1959=26. 24≠26.x = 1960: s(x)=16. 1985 -1960=25. 16≠25.x = 1961: s(x)=17. 1985 -1961=24. 17≠24.x = 1962: s(x)=18. 1985 -1962=23. 18≠23.x = 1963: s(x)=19. 1985 -1963=22. 19≠22.x = 1964: s(x)=20. 1985 -1964=21. 20≠21.x = 1965: s(x)=21. 1985 -1965=20. 21≠20.x = 1966: s(x)=22. 1985 -1966=19. 22≠19.x = 1967: s(x)=23. 1985 -1967=18. 23≠18.x = 1968: s(x)=23. 1985 -1968=17. 23≠17.x = 1969: s(x)=25. 1985 -1969=16. 25≠16.x = 1970: s(x)=17. 1985 -1970=15. 17≠15.x = 1971: s(x)=18. 1985 -1971=14. 18≠14.x = 1972: s(x)=19. 1985 -1972=13. 19≠13.x = 1973: s(x)=20. 1985 -1973=12. 20≠12.x = 1974: s(x)=21. 1985 -1974=11. 21≠11.x = 1975: s(x)=22. 1985 -1975=10. 22≠10.x = 1976: s(x)=23. 1985 -1976=9. 23≠9.x = 1977: s(x)=24. 1985 -1977=8. 24≠8.x = 1978: s(x)=25. 1985 -1978=7. 25≠7.x = 1979: s(x)=26. 1985 -1979=6. 26≠6.x = 1980: s(x)=18. 1985 -1980=5. 18≠5.x = 1981: s(x)=19. 1985 -1981=4. 19≠4.x = 1982: s(x)=20. 1985 -1982=3. 20≠3.x = 1983: s(x)=21. 1985 -1983=2. 21≠2.x = 1984: s(x)=21. 1985 -1984=1. 21≠1.So, indeed, no predecessors for 1985. Therefore, the only path with length greater than 2 is the one through 2003, which gives n=6.But wait, let me confirm if 1919 is indeed the first term or if there is a predecessor for 1919 that we missed.Looking back, for x + s(x) = 1919. x = 1919 - s(x). The range is 1883 to 1918.Let me check if there&#39;s a predecessor we missed. For example:x = 1897: s(x)=25. 1919 -1897=22. 25≠22.x = 1909: s(x)=19. 1919 -1909=10. 19≠10.x = 1889: s(x)=26. 1919 -1889=30. 26≠30.x = 1900: s(x)=10. 1919 -1900=19. 10≠19.x = 1890: s(x)=18. 1919 -1890=29. 18≠29.x = 1905: s(x)=15. 1919 -1905=14. 15≠14.x = 1895: s(x)=23. 1919 -1895=24. 23≠24.x = 1910: s(x)=11. 1919 -1910=9. 11≠9.x = 1915: s(x)=16. 1919 -1915=4. 16≠4.x = 1918: s(x)=19. 1919 -1918=1. 19≠1.Hmm, seems no predecessor. Therefore, 1919 is the first term.Therefore, the maximum possible n is 6. However, just to be thorough, let&#39;s check another angle.Suppose there exists another chain leading to 2008 with more terms. For example, maybe through a different set of predecessors. But based on the predecessors we found for each term, it&#39;s unlikely.Alternatively, maybe there are longer chains by choosing different predecessors at each step. But in our case, each step only had one predecessor, except for 2008, which had two, but only one led to a longer chain.Alternatively, maybe starting from a different starting point and reaching 2008 in more steps. But the question is asking for the maximum n where a_n = 2008. So, we need to see how far back we can go from 2008. The further back we can trace predecessors, the larger n will be.Since we found a chain of 6 terms: 1919, 1939, 1961, 1978, 2003, 2008. Therefore, n=6. Is there a longer chain?Wait, let&#39;s check once again for predecessors of 1919. Maybe we missed something.x + s(x) = 1919. x = 1919 - s(x). Range 1883-1918.Wait, x = 1897: 1897 + s(1897) = 1897 +25=1922≠1919.x = 1898: 1898 +26=1924≠1919.x = 1906: 1906 +16=1922≠1919.x = 1907: 1907 +17=1924≠1919.x = 1912: 1912 +13=1925≠1919.x = 1903: 1903 +13=1916≠1919.x = 1904: 1904 +14=1918≠1919.x = 1908: 1908 +17=1925≠1919.x = 1911: 1911 +12=1923≠1919.x = 1913: 1913 +14=1927≠1919.x = 1914: 1914 +15=1929≠1919.x = 1916: 1916 +17=1933≠1919.x = 1917: 1917 +18=1935≠1919.x = 1918: 1918 +19=1937≠1919.x = 1899: 1899 +27=1926≠1919.x = 1888: 1888 +25=1913≠1919.x = 1896: 1896 +24=1920≠1919.x = 1894: 1894 +22=1916≠1919.x = 1885: 1885 +22=1907≠1919.No, seems like there is no x such that x + s(x) = 1919, except maybe we missed something. Wait, x = 1900: 1900 +10=1910≠1919.x = 1901: 1901 +11=1912≠1919.x = 1893: 1893 +21=1914≠1919.x = 1887: 1887 +24=1911≠1919.No, so 1919 is indeed the starting point. Therefore, the chain length is 6.But the problem says &quot;the greatest possible n for which it is possible to have a_n = 2008.&quot; So, if we can have a sequence where a_6 = 2008, then the answer is 6. However, to be absolutely sure, let&#39;s confirm each step:a_1 = 1919a_2 = 1919 + s(1919) = 1919 + 1+9+1+9 = 1919 +20 = 1939a_3 = 1939 + s(1939) = 1939 +1+9+3+9 = 1939 +22 = 1961a_4 = 1961 + s(1961) = 1961 +1+9+6+1 = 1961 +17 = 1978a_5 = 1978 + s(1978) = 1978 +1+9+7+8 = 1978 +25 = 2003a_6 = 2003 + s(2003) = 2003 +2+0+0+3 = 2003 +5 = 2008Yes, that works. So n=6.But wait, is there a longer chain? For example, if there is another predecessor chain that branches off earlier.For instance, when we were at 1978, if there was another predecessor besides 1961, but we didn&#39;t find any. Similarly, at 1961, only 1939; at 1939, only 1919. So, no branching.Alternatively, if there&#39;s a different path from 2008 that doesn&#39;t go through 2003. But the other predecessor is 1985, which doesn&#39;t lead anywhere.Alternatively, maybe starting from a different term. Suppose there&#39;s another term that eventually leads to 2008 through a different route. For example, maybe another number which when you add digits several times reaches 2008. But since we are to find the maximum n where a_n = 2008, we need the longest possible backwards chain from 2008.Unless there exists a number x such that x + s(x) + s(x+s(x)) + ... = 2008 with more steps. But according to our exploration, the longest chain is 6 steps.But let me check another possibility. Suppose there is a starting number which takes more steps to reach 2008. For example, starting from a lower number and adding digit sums multiple times to reach 2008. However, since we are working backwards from 2008, the maximum n is determined by the longest reverse chain.But in our backward approach, we found that the maximum number of reverse steps is 5 (from 2008 back to 1919), making n=6. Unless there&#39;s a longer reverse chain.Wait, maybe if we find another predecessor for 1919. Wait, we already checked and couldn&#39;t find any.Alternatively, maybe the chain can be extended further forward. For example, starting before 1919. But since we can&#39;t find a predecessor for 1919, that&#39;s the start.Therefore, I think the answer is 6. But wait, let me check literature or similar problems.Wait, this problem resembles the &quot;digitaddition&quot; sequences, similar to the Colombian numbers or self numbers. In such sequences, a number that can be expressed as m + s(m) is not a self number. The problem here is similar but asking for the longest possible sequence ending at 2008.From similar problems I recall that the maximum length typically isn&#39;t very large, like single digits. Our found n=6 seems reasonable, but I need to confirm.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different chain. Let&#39;s try another path. Suppose starting from 2008, predecessors are 1985 and 2003. The path through 2003 gives us a longer chain. Let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a different predecessor somewhere in that chain.Wait, when we were at 1978, we found only 1961. At 1961, only 1939. At 1939, only 1919. At 1919, none. So, no alternative there.Wait, but what if when moving from 1939 to 1961, there was another predecessor? Wait, 1961&#39;s only predecessor is 1939.Alternatively, when moving from 1978 to 2003, but no, 2003&#39;s predecessor is 1978.Alternatively, is there a different path from 2008 through 2003 to some other number? Wait, 2003&#39;s predecessor is 1978, whose predecessor is 1961, and so on. So that chain is fixed.Alternatively, let&#39;s see if 2003 has another predecessor. Earlier, we found 1978. Let&#39;s confirm:x + s(x) = 2003. x = 2003 - s(x). Range: 1967 to 2002.We found x = 1978. Let&#39;s check another number:x = 1985: s(x)=23. 2003 -1985=18. 23≠18.x = 1990: s(x)=19. 2003 -1990=13. 19≠13.x = 1980: s(x)=18. 2003 -1980=23. 18≠23.x = 1975: s(x)=22. 2003 -1975=28. 22≠28.x = 1969: s(x)=25. 2003 -1969=34. 25≠34.x = 1993: s(x)=22. 2003 -1993=10. 22≠10.x = 1999: s(x)=28. 2003 -1999=4. 28≠4.x = 2000: s(x)=2. 2003 -2000=3. 2≠3.x = 2001: s(x)=3. 2003 -2001=2. 3≠2.x = 2002: s(x)=4. 2003 -2002=1. 4≠1.x = 1987: s(x)=25. 2003 -1987=16. 25≠16.x = 1995: s(x)=24. 2003 -1995=8. 24≠8.x = 1976: s(x)=23. 2003 -1976=27. 23≠27.x = 1982: s(x)=20. 2003 -1982=21. 20≠21.x = 1988: s(x)=26. 2003 -1988=15. 26≠15.x = 1983: s(x)=21. 2003 -1983=20. 21≠20.x = 1977: s(x)=24. 2003 -1977=26. 24≠26.x = 1967: s(x)=23. 2003 -1967=36. 23≠36.So, only x = 1978 is a predecessor for 2003. So, no alternative there.Therefore, I think the conclusion is that the maximum possible n is 6.But to be absolutely sure, let me consider if there&#39;s a different chain with more terms by some coincidence.Suppose someone started at a lower number, say, 1919, and then goes up to 2008 in 6 steps. But could there be another number lower than 1919 that eventually reaches 2008 in more steps? For example, if there&#39;s a number x such that x + s(x) + s(x+s(x)) + ... many times equals 2008. However, working backwards is the way to find the longest chain, and we&#39;ve already traced back as far as possible to 1919.Since we can&#39;t go further back from 1919, that&#39;s the earliest term, giving n=6.Therefore, the greatest possible n is 6.Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest possible ( n ) such that ( a_n = 2008 ) in the sequence defined by ( a_{n+1} = a_n + s(a_n) ), where ( s(a) ) denotes the sum of the digits of ( a ).We start by working backwards from 2008 to find its predecessors. A number ( x ) is a predecessor of 2008 if ( x + s(x) = 2008 ). We found two predecessors: 1985 and 2003.1. Predecessor 1985:   - Checking predecessors for 1985, we found no valid predecessors. Thus, the chain starting from 1985 is only two terms: 1985, 2008.2. Predecessor 2003:   - We continue working backwards from 2003. The predecessors of 2003 are found by solving ( x + s(x) = 2003 ). We found 1978.   - Predecessors of 1978: Found 1961.   - Predecessors of 1961: Found 1939.   - Predecessors of 1939: Found 1919.   - Predecessors of 1919: None found.The chain starting from 1919 is:[ 1919 rightarrow 1939 rightarrow 1961 rightarrow 1978 rightarrow 2003 rightarrow 2008 ]This chain has 6 terms, so the greatest possible ( n ) is 6.Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{6}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible n such that in the sequence defined by a_{n+1} = a_n + s(a_n), where s(a_n) is the sum of the digits of a_n, the term a_n is 2008. Hmm. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.First, the sequence is defined recursively. Each term is the previous term plus the sum of its digits. So, for example, if we start with a_1, then a_2 = a_1 + s(a_1), a_3 = a_2 + s(a_2), and so on. The question is asking for the maximum possible value of n where a_n can be 2008. That means we need to look backward from 2008 and try to find all possible previous terms that could lead to 2008, and then see how far back we can go.So, essentially, we need to find the longest possible chain of numbers starting from some a_1, such that each subsequent term is obtained by adding the sum of its digits, and ending at 2008. The challenge is to find the maximum n where a_n = 2008. To do this, we need to reconstruct possible predecessors of 2008, predecessors of those predecessors, etc., until we can&#39;t go back any further. The longest such chain would give the maximum n.Let me think. Let&#39;s denote that for a term a_k, the previous term would be a_{k-1} such that a_k = a_{k-1} + s(a_{k-1}). So, to find a_{k-1}, we need to find all possible numbers m such that m + s(m) = a_k. Each such m would be a possible predecessor. Then, for each of those m&#39;s, we can repeat the process to find their predecessors, and so on. The key here is that each term can have multiple predecessors, but we need to find the path that gives the longest possible chain.But how do we find all possible predecessors of a given number? Let&#39;s take 2008 as our starting point. Let me write down the equation: m + s(m) = 2008. So, m = 2008 - s(m). Therefore, to find m, we need to find numbers m such that when we subtract the sum of their digits from them, we get 2008. However, since s(m) is at least 1 (since m is a positive integer) and at most 9 * number_of_digits(m), m must be less than 2008, but how much less?For example, the maximum possible s(m) for a number m less than 2008 would be for 1999, which is 1+9+9+9=28. So, s(m) can be up to 28. Therefore, the minimal possible m is 2008 - 28 = 1980. So, m must be between 1980 and 2007, inclusive. So, possible predecessors of 2008 are numbers m where 1980 ≤ m ≤ 2007, and m + s(m) = 2008. Therefore, m = 2008 - s(m). So, for each m in that range, compute s(m) and check if 2008 - s(m) equals m. If so, then m is a predecessor.Therefore, to find all predecessors of 2008, we can iterate m from 1980 to 2007, compute s(m), and check if m + s(m) = 2008. Let me do that.First, let&#39;s note that 2008 is a 4-digit number. So, numbers from 1980 to 2007 are 4-digit numbers as well (since 1980 is 4 digits). Let&#39;s compute s(m) for each m in that range. But this seems tedious. Maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, since m = 2008 - s(m), we can represent m as 2008 minus the sum of its digits. Let&#39;s denote the digits of m as thousands digit a, hundreds digit b, tens digit c, and units digit d. Then, m = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Then, s(m) = a + b + c + d. So, the equation becomes:1000a + 100b + 10c + d + a + b + c + d = 2008Which simplifies to:1001a + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2008Hmm, interesting. So, we can model this as a Diophantine equation: 1001a + 101b + 11c + 2d = 2008, where a, b, c, d are digits with a ≥ 1 (since m is a 4-digit number). Wait, but m is between 1980 and 2007, so a can only be 1 or 2. Let&#39;s check:If m is between 1980 and 1999, then a = 1, b = 9, c is 8 or 9, and d varies.If m is between 2000 and 2007, then a = 2, b = 0, c is 0, and d varies from 0 to 7.So, perhaps we can split this into two cases: m in 1980-1999 and m in 2000-2007.Case 1: m is between 1980 and 1999.Then, a = 1, b = 9. Let&#39;s write m as 19cd, where c is 8 or 9 (since 1980 ≤ m ≤ 1999). Then, the equation becomes:1001*1 + 101*9 + 11c + 2d = 2008Compute 1001 + 101*9:1001 + 909 = 1910So, 1910 + 11c + 2d = 2008Therefore, 11c + 2d = 2008 - 1910 = 98So, 11c + 2d = 98Given that c is 8 or 9 (since m is 19cd, and m is between 1980-1999, c can be 8 or 9).First, c = 8:11*8 + 2d = 88 + 2d = 982d = 10 =&gt; d = 5So, d = 5. Therefore, m = 1985.Check: m = 1985, s(m) = 1+9+8+5=23, so 1985 +23=2008. Correct.Second, c = 9:11*9 + 2d = 99 + 2d =98But 99 +2d=98 implies 2d= -1, which is impossible. So, no solution here.Therefore, in the 1980-1999 range, the only predecessor is 1985.Case 2: m is between 2000 and 2007.Then, a=2, b=0, c=0, and d from 0 to7.So, m = 2000 + d, where d=0,...,7So, let&#39;s write the equation:1001*2 + 101*0 +11*0 +2d =2008Calculate 1001*2=2002So, 2002 + 0 + 0 +2d=2008Thus, 2d = 6 =&gt; d=3Therefore, m=2003Check: m=2003, s(m)=2+0+0+3=5, so 2003 +5=2008. Correct.Therefore, in the 2000-2007 range, the only predecessor is 2003.Therefore, for a_n =2008, the possible a_{n-1} are 1985 and 2003.So, each of these two numbers can be predecessors of 2008, meaning that to find the maximum n, we need to see which of these two predecessors can lead to a longer chain.Therefore, we have two branches to consider:1. 2008 ← 1985 ← ... ?2. 2008 ← 2003 ← ... ?We need to explore both branches and see which one gives a longer chain.So, first, let&#39;s consider the first branch: 2008 ← 1985. Let&#39;s find predecessors of 1985.Similarly, to find predecessors of 1985, we need to solve m + s(m) =1985. So, m =1985 - s(m). The same approach applies.First, find the range of possible m. The maximum s(m) for numbers less than 1985 would be, say, for 1985 -1=1984. The sum of digits for 1984 is 1+9+8+4=22. So, the maximum possible s(m) is 22 (but maybe higher for smaller numbers, but let&#39;s check). Wait, actually, for numbers around 1985, the maximum sum of digits would be 1+9+9+9=28. Wait, but 1985 is in the 1900s, so numbers from, say, 1950 to 1984. The maximum sum would be for 1999, which is 28. But since m must be less than 1985, the maximum sum would be for 1984:1+9+8+4=22. Wait, but 1984 is 1 less than 1985, but actually, numbers like 1999 are over 1985. Wait, m must be less than 1985 because m + s(m)=1985. So, m must be less than 1985. Therefore, the maximum possible s(m) would be for the number 1984: 1+9+8+4=22, but perhaps even higher for numbers like 1899:1+8+9+9=27. Wait, 1899 is much less than 1985, so m can be as low as 1985 - s(m). So, the minimum m would be 1985 - s(m). Since s(m) can be as large as 27 (for 1899), the minimal m would be 1985 -27=1958. So, m ranges from 1958 to 1984.Therefore, m is in 1958 to 1984. Let&#39;s model the equation again.Let me write m as a 4-digit number: a=1, b=9 (since m is between 1958 and 1984). Wait, actually, 1958 is 1958, so a=1, b=9, c=5, d=8. So, m ranges from 1958 to 1984. Therefore, m is in the form 19cd, where c is 5 to 8 (since 1984 is 1984, c=8, d=4). Wait, 1958 to 1984:- 1958 to 1999 is m, but m must be less than 1985.So, m is from 1958 up to 1984. So, m is 19cd where c is 5,6,7,8 and d accordingly. Let&#39;s model the equation.m + s(m)=1985. So, m=1985 - s(m). Let&#39;s represent m as 1000a +100b +10c +d. Here, a=1, b=9, c from 5 to 8 (since m is 1958 to 1984). So:1000*1 + 100*9 +10c +d +1 +9 +c +d =1985Compute:1000 + 900 +10c +d +10 +c +d=1985Total:1900 +11c +2d +10=1985So, 1910 +11c +2d=1985Therefore, 11c +2d=1985 -1910=75So, 11c +2d=75, where c is 5,6,7,8 and d is a digit (0-9). Let&#39;s check for each c:c=5:11*5=55, so 2d=75-55=20 =&gt; d=10, which is invalid (digit must be 0-9). So no solution.c=6:11*6=66, 2d=75-66=9 =&gt; d=4.5. Not an integer. No solution.c=7:11*7=77, 2d=75-77=-2. Negative. Impossible. No solution.c=8:11*8=88, 2d=75-88=-13. Negative. Impossible. No solution.Wait, so there are no solutions in the 1958-1984 range? That can&#39;t be right. Maybe my approach is wrong.Alternatively, maybe m can have a different hundreds digit? Wait, m is from 1958 to 1984, so the hundreds digit is 9? No, wait, 1958: 1 (thousands), 9 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 8 (units). Similarly, 1984 is 1,9,8,4. So, hundreds digit is 9 for all these numbers. So, in the equation, b=9. But in that case, we derived 11c +2d=75 with c from 5 to8, which gave no solutions. Therefore, there are no predecessors for 1985? That would mean that the chain starting from 1985 cannot be extended further back, so the chain would be 1985 ← 2008, making n=2 if starting from 1985. But wait, but maybe there&#39;s a predecessor of 1985 outside the range 1958-1984?Wait, hold on. The minimal m is 1985 - s(m). The maximum s(m) is 1+9+9+9=28 (if m is 1999, but m must be less than 1985). Wait, m has to be less than 1985, so the maximum possible sum of digits for m &lt;1985 would be for 1899: 1+8+9+9=27. So, m &gt;=1985 -27=1958. Therefore, m ranges from 1958 to 1984. But in that range, we found no solutions. Therefore, does this mean that 1985 cannot have any predecessors? Therefore, the chain starting at 1985 would have a_{n-1}=1985, a_n=2008, so n=2. But the other branch is 2003, which may have predecessors.Wait, let&#39;s check the other branch first. So, the second predecessor of 2008 is 2003. Let&#39;s find predecessors of 2003.So, m + s(m) =2003. So, m=2003 -s(m). Let&#39;s find m.Again, the maximum s(m) for m &lt;2003 would be 1999:1+9+9+9=28. So, m &gt;=2003 -28=1975. So, m ranges from 1975 to 2002.But 2003 is a 4-digit number, so m is in 1975 to 2002. Let&#39;s model this.Let me write the equation again: m + s(m) =2003. m=2003 -s(m). Let&#39;s consider m as a 4-digit number, with thousands digit a=1 or 2.If m is between 1975 and 1999, then a=1, b=9, c varies from 7 to9, and d varies.If m is between 2000 and2002, then a=2, b=0, c=0, d=0 to2.So, two cases.Case1: m between1975-1999.So, a=1, b=9. Then, m=19cd. The equation:1000*1 + 100*9 +10c +d +1 +9 +c +d =2003Compute:1000 +900 +10c +d +10 +c +d =2003Total:1910 +11c +2d=2003Thus, 11c +2d=2003 -1910=93So, 11c +2d=93. Here, c is from7 to9 (since m is 1975-1999, so c is at least7). Let&#39;s check c=7,8,9.c=7:11*7=77, 2d=93-77=16 ⇒ d=8. So, m=1978.Check:1978 +1+9+7+8=1978+25=2003. Correct.c=8:11*8=88, 2d=93-88=5 ⇒ d=2.5. Not an integer. No solution.c=9:11*9=99, 2d=93-99= -6. Negative. No solution.Thus, only c=7, d=8: m=1978.Case2: m between2000-2002.a=2, b=0, c=0, d=0 to2.Equation:2000 +0 +0 +d +2 +0 +0 +d=2003So,2000 + d +2 +d=2003 ⇒ 2d +2002=2003 ⇒ 2d=1 ⇒d=0.5. Not integer. No solution.Thus, only predecessor is 1978.Therefore, predecessors of 2003 are 1978.So, now, we can go back from 2003 to 1978. Now, we need to find predecessors of 1978.So, m + s(m)=1978. Therefore, m=1978 - s(m). Let&#39;s find m.Maximum s(m) for m &lt;1978: the maximum sum would be for 1899:1+8+9+9=27. So, m &gt;=1978 -27=1951. So, m ranges from1951 to1977.Again, m is a 4-digit number: a=1, b=9, c varies (since m is between1951 to1977). Wait, 1951:1,9,5,1. 1977:1,9,7,7. So, thousands digit=1, hundreds digit=9, tens digit from5 to7 (since m is up to1977). Wait, 1951 has c=5, 1977 has c=7.Therefore, m=19cd, c=5,6,7; d=0-9. But m must be between1951 and1977.So, equation:1000*1 +100*9 +10c +d +1 +9 +c +d=1978Compute:1000 +900 +10c +d +10 +c +d=1978Total:1910 +11c +2d=1978Thus, 11c +2d=1978 -1910=68So, 11c +2d=68. c=5,6,7.Check c=5:11*5=55. 2d=68-55=13 ⇒d=6.5. Not integer.c=6:11*6=66. 2d=68-66=2 ⇒d=1. So, m=1961.Check:1961 +1+9+6+1=1961 +17=1978. Correct.c=7:11*7=77. 2d=68-77= -9. Negative. Impossible.Thus, only c=6, d=1: m=1961.Therefore, predecessor of 1978 is 1961.Now, find predecessors of 1961.So, m + s(m)=1961. m=1961 -s(m).Maximum s(m)=27 (for 1899), so m &gt;=1961 -27=1934. m ranges from1934 to1960.So, m is from1934 to1960. Let&#39;s model this.m=19cd, with c=3 to6 (since 1934: c=3, 1960: c=6). Let&#39;s write the equation:1000*1 +100*9 +10c +d +1 +9 +c +d=1961Compute:1000 +900 +10c +d +10 +c +d=1961Total:1910 +11c +2d=1961Thus, 11c +2d=1961 -1910=51So, 11c +2d=51. c=3,4,5,6.Check each:c=3:11*3=33. 2d=51-33=18 ⇒d=9. So, m=1939.Check:1939 +1+9+3+9=1939 +22=1961. Correct.c=4:11*4=44. 2d=51-44=7 ⇒d=3.5. Not integer.c=5:11*5=55. 2d=51-55=-4. Negative.c=6:11*6=66. 2d=51-66=-15. Negative.Thus, only m=1939 is predecessor.Therefore, predecessor of 1961 is 1939.Now, predecessors of 1939.m + s(m)=1939. m=1939 -s(m).Maximum s(m)=1+9+9+9=28 (for 1999, but m must be less than1939). Wait, m is less than1939, so maximum s(m) would be for 1899:1+8+9+9=27. So, m &gt;=1939 -27=1912.Thus, m ranges from1912 to1938.m is a 4-digit number: a=1, b=9, c=1 to3 (since m from1912 to1938). So, m=191d to1938.Equation:1000*1 +100*9 +10c +d +1 +9 +c +d=1939Compute:1000 +900 +10c +d +10 +c +d=1939Total:1910 +11c +2d=1939So, 11c +2d=1939 -1910=29c is 1,2,3 (since m is 1912-1938). Let&#39;s check:c=1:11*1=11. 2d=29-11=18 ⇒d=9. m=1919.Check:1919 +1+9+1+9=1919 +20=1939. Correct.c=2:11*2=22. 2d=29-22=7 ⇒d=3.5. Not integer.c=3:11*3=33. 2d=29-33= -4. Negative.Thus, only m=1919 is predecessor.Predecessor of 1939 is 1919.Now, predecessors of 1919.m + s(m)=1919. m=1919 -s(m).Maximum s(m)=27 (for 1899), so m &gt;=1919 -27=1892.m ranges from1892 to1918.m is a 4-digit number: a=1, b=8 or9. Let&#39;s consider:If m is from1892 to1899: b=8, c=9, d=2-9.If m is from1900 to1918: b=9, c=0 to1, d=0-8.So, split into two cases.Case1: m=189d (d=2-9)Equation:1000*1 +100*8 +10*9 +d +1 +8 +9 +d=1919Compute:1000 +800 +90 +d +1 +8 +9 +d=1919Total:1908 +2d=1919Thus, 2d=11 ⇒d=5.5. Not integer. No solution.Case2: m=19cd, where b=9, c=0 or1, d varies.For m from1900-1918: c=0 or1.First, c=0:Equation:1000*1 +100*9 +10*0 +d +1 +9 +0 +d=1919Compute:1000 +900 +0 +d +10 +d=1919Total:1910 +2d=1919 ⇒2d=9 ⇒d=4.5. Not integer.c=1:Equation:1000*1 +100*9 +10*1 +d +1 +9 +1 +d=1919Compute:1000 +900 +10 +d +1 +9 +1 +d=1919Total:1921 +2d=1919 ⇒2d= -2 ⇒d=-1. Impossible.Thus, no predecessors in this case. Therefore, m=1919 has no predecessors. Therefore, the chain ends here.Therefore, starting from 2008, the chain through 2003 is:2008 ←2003←1978←1961←1939←1919← (no predecessors)So, the length here is: starting from 1919, which is a_1=1919, then a_2=1939, a_3=1961, a_4=1978, a_5=2003, a_6=2008. So, n=6.On the other hand, the other branch:2008←1985. We saw that 1985 has no predecessors, so the chain would be a_1=1985, a_2=2008. So, n=2.Therefore, the longer chain is n=6. So, the greatest possible n is6.Wait, but before concluding, let me check if there are other predecessors in any steps that I might have missed. For example, when I was finding predecessors for 1919, I considered m in the range1892-1918 and split into two cases. But maybe m is a 3-digit number? Wait, m must be less than1919, but m &gt;=1892, which are all 4-digit numbers (since 1000 is the minimum 4-digit number). So, m cannot be a 3-digit number here.Wait, also, when finding predecessors for 1939, I considered m=1919. Let me check again.Wait, when solving for predecessors of1939, m +s(m)=1939, m ranges from1912-1938. So, m=19cd where c=1,2,3. Wait, but for c=1, the number is191d, which is from1910-1919, but m has to be at least1912. So, d=2-9. Then, when we found m=1919, which is at the upper end. But in the equation, when c=1, we got m=1919. Wait, but 1919 is in the range1912-1938. So that&#39;s correct.But let me check if there are other possible predecessors in some steps. For example, when we had m +s(m)=1978, we found m=1961. Let me check if there&#39;s another m.Wait, in the equation for predecessors of1978:11c +2d=68, c=5,6,7. We found c=6 gives d=1. What if c=5,6,7 but m is not in the form19cd? Wait, no, m must be in 1951-1977, so it&#39;s 19cd. So, correct.Similarly, for predecessors of2003, m=1978. Correct.So, in each step, we only found one predecessor. So, the chain is unique in that branch. Therefore, the maximum possible n is6.But let me check if there are alternative paths. For instance, when going back from2008, we had two options:1985 and2003. We took2003 and got a chain of length6. If we took1985, which can&#39;t go back, so length2. Therefore,6 is the maximum.But wait, let&#39;s see if any other numbers could lead to2008 through a different path. Wait, no, because when we computed predecessors of2008, only1985 and2003 exist. So, only two possible previous terms. So, all chains ending at2008 must go through either1985 or2003. Since the chain through2003 is longer, that&#39;s the maximum.Therefore, the greatest possible n is6.But wait, let me confirm once again by writing out the entire chain:a_1=1919a_2=1919 +1+9+1+9=1919+20=1939a_3=1939 +1+9+3+9=1939+22=1961a_4=1961 +1+9+6+1=1961+17=1978a_5=1978 +1+9+7+8=1978+25=2003a_6=2003 +2+0+0+3=2003+5=2008Yes, that&#39;s six terms. So, n=6.Is there a possibility of another chain with longer length? For example, is there another number in some step that could have multiple predecessors leading to a longer chain?For instance, when we found predecessors of2003, we found only1978. Predecessors of1978 is1961, predecessors of1961 is1939, predecessors of1939 is1919, and predecessors of1919 is none. So, that&#39;s the only chain.Alternatively, could there be another number besides1978 that leads to2003? When we solved for predecessors of2003, we found only1978. So, no.Similarly, predecessors of1985 don&#39;t exist. Therefore, there&#39;s no alternative longer chain.Thus, the maximum possible n is6.Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;To find the greatest possible ( n ) such that ( a_n = 2008 ) in the sequence defined by ( a_{n+1} = a_n + s(a_n) ), we need to trace back the possible predecessors of 2008 and determine the longest chain.1.

Predecessors of 1919:   - Solve ( m + s(m) = 1919 ):     - No solutions found.The chain starting from 1919 is:[ 1919 rightarrow 1939 rightarrow 1961 rightarrow 1978 rightarrow 2003 rightarrow 2008 ]This chain has 6 terms, thus the greatest possible ( n ) is ( boxed{6} ).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>To find the greatest possible ( n ) for which it is possible to have ( a_n = 2008 ), we need to trace back the sequence ( a_n ) to see how far we can go.

So, we have trapezoid ABCD with AD parallel to BC. On side CD, there&#39;s a point M such that CM = 8 and MD = 9, making CD = 17. A perpendicular AH is dropped from vertex A to segment BM, and it&#39;s given that AD = HD. We need to find the length of AD, given that BC = 16.First, let me visualize the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, AD and BC are the two bases. The legs are AB and CD. Point M is on CD, closer to C since CM is 8 and MD is 9. Then, from A, we drop a perpendicular to BM, which is AH, and it&#39;s given that AD = HD. So, H is a point on BM such that AH is perpendicular to BM and HD = AD. Our goal is to find AD.Hmm. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s place point D at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Since AD is parallel to BC, and assuming AD is the lower base, but actually, since in trapezoid terminology, the bases are the two parallel sides. Wait, the problem says AD || BC, so AD and BC are the two bases. So, depending on how the trapezoid is oriented, maybe AD is the left side and BC is the right side? Wait, no. In a trapezoid, the bases are the two sides that are parallel. So, if AD is parallel to BC, then they must be the two non-adjacent sides. So, the trapezoid is probably arranged with AD and BC as the two bases, meaning that sides AB and CD are the legs. But then point M is on CD. So CD is a leg, but it&#39;s split into CM = 8 and MD = 9. Wait, but CD is a leg, so its length is CM + MD = 17. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I should draw the trapezoid to get a better idea. Let me try to sketch it mentally. Let&#39;s fix coordinate system. Let me place point D at (0, 0). Since AD is a base, let&#39;s let AD lie along the x-axis. So point A would be at (a, 0), where a is the length of AD, which we need to find. Then, since BC is parallel to AD and BC = 16, point B and C must be somewhere above. Since AB and CD are the legs, which are not necessarily parallel. Let me think. So, point C is on the same side as D, but since BC is parallel to AD, BC must be shifted up by some height. Let&#39;s assign coordinates.Let me proceed step by step:1. Let’s place point D at (0, 0).2. Since AD is a base, let&#39;s place point A at (a, 0), so AD has length a.3. Since BC is parallel to AD and has length 16, we need to position points B and C such that BC = 16 and BC is parallel to AD (which is along the x-axis). So, BC will also be horizontal. Let&#39;s denote the height of the trapezoid as h. Then, points B and C will be at some coordinates (x, h) and (x + 16, h), respectively. However, since CD is a leg, connecting point D (0,0) to C (x + 16, h). Similarly, AB connects A (a, 0) to B (x, h). The coordinates must satisfy these connections.But perhaps it&#39;s better to fix the coordinates such that the legs are between the bases. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me place AD along the x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0). Then, BC is parallel to AD, so BC is also horizontal. Let’s assume the height of the trapezoid is h, so the coordinates of B and C would be (b, h) and (b + 16, h), respectively. Now, CD connects point C (b + 16, h) to D (0,0). So the coordinates of point C must be such that CD is a leg of the trapezoid. Similarly, AB connects point A (a,0) to point B (b, h). Then, the coordinates must satisfy the positions of M on CD.Point M is on CD such that CM = 8 and MD = 9. Since CD has length 17 (8 + 9), let&#39;s verify that. The distance from C to D is sqrt((b + 16 - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2) = sqrt((b + 16)^2 + h^2) = 17. So, we have that (b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 17^2 = 289. That&#39;s one equation.Similarly, AB is the other leg, connecting A (a,0) to B (b, h). The length of AB would be sqrt((b - a)^2 + h^2). However, since we don&#39;t have information about AB&#39;s length, maybe this isn&#39;t necessary yet.Now, point M is on CD. Since CM = 8 and MD = 9, point M divides CD in the ratio CM:MD = 8:9. Therefore, the coordinates of M can be found using the section formula. Coordinates of C are (b + 16, h), coordinates of D are (0,0). Therefore, point M is [(9*(b + 16) + 8*0)/ (8 + 9), (9*h + 8*0)/17] = [(9(b + 16))/17, 9h/17].So, coordinates of M are (9(b + 16)/17, 9h/17).Now, we need to construct BM. Point B is at (b, h), so the line BM goes from (b, h) to (9(b + 16)/17, 9h/17). Let&#39;s find the equation of BM.The slope of BM is (9h/17 - h)/(9(b + 16)/17 - b) = (-8h/17)/( -8b/17 + 144/17) = (-8h)/(-8b + 144) = (8h)/(8b - 144) = h/(b - 18).So, the slope of BM is h/(b - 18). Therefore, the equation of BM is y - h = [h/(b - 18)](x - b).Now, from point A (a,0), we drop a perpendicular to BM, which is AH. The foot of the perpendicular is H. We are told that AD = HD. Since AD is the length from A (a,0) to D (0,0), which is &#39;a&#39;. So HD must also be &#39;a&#39;. But HD is the distance from H to D (0,0). Therefore, H lies on the plane such that the distance from H to D is equal to AD, which is &#39;a&#39;. So, H is a point on BM such that AH is perpendicular to BM and the distance from H to D is a.Therefore, coordinates of H must satisfy:1. H lies on BM: y - h = [h/(b - 18)](x - b).2. AH is perpendicular to BM: The slope of AH is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BM. Since BM has slope h/(b - 18), then AH has slope -(b - 18)/h.But AH passes through A (a,0) and H (x, y). So, the slope of AH is (y - 0)/(x - a) = y/(x - a). Therefore:y/(x - a) = -(b - 18)/h =&gt; y = [-(b - 18)/h](x - a).Additionally, the distance from H to D is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = a. So:x^2 + y^2 = a^2.So now, we have three equations:1. H lies on BM: y = h + [h/(b - 18)](x - b).2. AH has slope -(b - 18)/h: y = [-(b - 18)/h](x - a).3. Distance from H to D is a: x^2 + y^2 = a^2.So, we can solve these equations to find x and y in terms of a, b, h, and then relate them with other equations from the trapezoid.But we also have some other constraints. Remember that CD has length 17, so (b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 289.Additionally, the coordinates of point C are (b + 16, h), and point D is (0,0), so CD is from (0,0) to (b + 16, h). Similarly, AB is from (a,0) to (b, h). The trapezoid sides AD and BC are parallel, which is already considered since both are horizontal in our coordinate system (AD from (0,0) to (a,0), BC from (b, h) to (b + 16, h)).Wait, but in our coordinate system, AD is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0), and BC is from (b, h) to (b + 16, h). So, they are both horizontal lines, hence parallel. The height of the trapezoid is h.Now, perhaps we can find another equation involving a, b, h. Let&#39;s see. The other leg AB connects (a,0) to (b, h). The length of AB is sqrt((b - a)^2 + h^2). Similarly, the other leg CD is sqrt((b + 16)^2 + h^2) = 17.But we don&#39;t know the length of AB. However, maybe there&#39;s another condition. Wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the trapezoid is isosceles or not, so maybe we need to use the other conditions given.Alternatively, since we have several variables: a, b, h. We need to form equations based on the given conditions.So far, we have:1. (b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 289. (from CD = 17)We need to find two more equations involving a, b, h.From the coordinates of H, which lies on BM and satisfies the perpendicularity from A, and the distance HD = AD = a.So, let&#39;s proceed to solve the three equations for H.First, let&#39;s express y from equation 1 and equation 2 and set them equal.From BM: y = h + [h/(b - 18)](x - b).From AH: y = [-(b - 18)/h](x - a).Set them equal:h + [h/(b - 18)](x - b) = [-(b - 18)/h](x - a)Multiply both sides by h(b - 18) to eliminate denominators:h^2(b - 18) + h^2(x - b) = - (b - 18)^2 (x - a)Let me check that step again. Wait, to eliminate denominators:Left side: [h + (h/(b - 18))(x - b)] multiplied by h(b - 18) gives h * h(b - 18) + h * h(x - b) = h^2(b - 18) + h^2(x - b)Right side: [-(b - 18)/h (x - a)] multiplied by h(b - 18) gives - (b - 18)^2 (x - a)So, the equation becomes:h^2(b - 18) + h^2(x - b) = - (b - 18)^2 (x - a)Let&#39;s simplify the left side:h^2[(b - 18) + (x - b)] = h^2(x - 18)So:h^2(x - 18) = - (b - 18)^2 (x - a)Bring all terms to left side:h^2(x - 18) + (b - 18)^2 (x - a) = 0Factor out x:x [h^2 + (b - 18)^2] - 18 h^2 - a (b - 18)^2 = 0Therefore:x = [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2]That&#39;s the x-coordinate of H. Then, we can find y using equation from AH:y = [-(b - 18)/h] (x - a)Once we have x and y in terms of a, b, h, we can plug into the third equation x^2 + y^2 = a^2.But this seems quite involved. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry more cleverly. Let me think.Given that AD = HD, and H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM. Since AD = HD, triangle AHD is isoceles with AD = HD, right? Wait, no. Wait, AD is a side of the trapezoid, and HD is a segment from H to D. If AD = HD, then in triangle AHD, sides AD and HD are equal, making it isoceles with base AH. But H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM, so AH is perpendicular to BM. Therefore, triangle AHD is isoceles with AD = HD and with AH as an altitude. Therefore, in triangle AHD, AH is the altitude and also the median and angle bisector. Therefore, H must lie such that it&#39;s equidistant from D and A. Wait, but AD = HD, not AH = HD. So, point H is such that HD = AD = a. So, the distance from H to D is equal to AD. So, H lies on the circle centered at D with radius a. Also, H lies on BM and is the foot of perpendicular from A to BM.Therefore, H is the intersection of BM and the circle centered at D with radius a, and also H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM.Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry, since we already set up the coordinates.But this seems complex. Let&#39;s try to proceed with the equations we have.We have x expressed in terms of a, b, h:x = [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2]Then, y = [-(b - 18)/h] (x - a)Then, substituting x into y:y = [-(b - 18)/h] [ (18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2)/(h^2 + (b - 18)^2) - a ]Simplify the expression inside the brackets:= [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 - a (h^2 + (b - 18)^2)] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2]= [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 - a h^2 - a (b - 18)^2] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2]Simplify numerator:18 h^2 - a h^2 = h^2(18 - a)Therefore, y = [-(b - 18)/h] * [ h^2(18 - a) / (h^2 + (b - 18)^2) ]Thus,y = [ - (b - 18)/h * h^2 (18 - a) ] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2 ]Simplify:= [ - (b - 18) h (18 - a) ] / [h^2 + (b - 18)^2 ]= [ (18 - a) h (b - 18) ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ] * (-1)Wait, actually:Wait, the numerator is - (b - 18)/h * h^2 (18 - a) = - (b - 18) * h (18 - a) = - h (b - 18)(18 - a) = h (b - 18)(a - 18)So, y = [ h (b - 18)(a - 18) ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]Therefore, coordinates of H are:x = [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]y = [ h (b - 18)(a - 18) ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]Now, since H is on BM, and we have these coordinates. But we also have the condition that x^2 + y^2 = a^2.So, let&#39;s plug x and y into this equation.First, compute x^2 + y^2:x^2 = [18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2]^2 / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]^2y^2 = [ h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a - 18)^2 ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]^2Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = [ (18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2)^2 + h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a - 18)^2 ] / [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]^2 = a^2Thus:[ (18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 )^2 + h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a - 18)^2 ] = a^2 [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]^2This equation seems very complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.Let me denote k = (b - 18)^2 + h^2. Then, note that k = (b - 18)^2 + h^2.But also, from CD&#39;s length: (b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 289.Hmm, perhaps there is a relationship between b and h.Given that (b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 289, so h^2 = 289 - (b + 16)^2.Therefore, h^2 = 289 - b^2 -32b -256 = 33 -32b -b^2.Wait, 289 - (b^2 +32b +256) = 289 -256 -b^2 -32b = 33 - b^2 -32b.So h^2 = -b^2 -32b +33.But h^2 must be positive, so -b^2 -32b +33 &gt; 0 → b^2 +32b -33 &lt; 0.Solving quadratic inequality: b^2 +32b -33 &lt; 0.The roots of the equation b^2 +32b -33 =0 are b = [-32 ± sqrt(1024 +132)] /2 = [-32 ± sqrt(1156)] /2 = [-32 ±34]/2.So, roots are (2)/2=1 and (-66)/2=-33. Therefore, the inequality holds when -33 &lt; b &lt; 1. So, b is between -33 and 1. That might be useful later.But perhaps we can find a relationship between a and b, h. Let&#39;s try to proceed.Going back to the equation:(18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 )^2 + h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a - 18)^2 = a^2 [ (b - 18)^2 + h^2 ]^2Let me expand both sides.Left side:First term: (18 h^2 + a (b - 18)^2 )^2= [a (b - 18)^2 +18 h^2]^2= a^2 (b - 18)^4 + 36 a (b - 18)^2 h^2 + 324 h^4Second term: h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a - 18)^2= h^2 (b - 18)^2 [a^2 -36a +324]So, left side total:= a^2 (b - 18)^4 +36a (b -18)^2 h^2 +324 h^4 + a^2 h^2 (b -18)^2 -36a h^2 (b -18)^2 +324 h^2 (b -18)^2Wait, expanding the second term:= h^2 (b - 18)^2 (a^2 -36a +324)= a^2 h^2 (b -18)^2 -36a h^2 (b -18)^2 + 324 h^2 (b -18)^2Therefore, combining with the first expanded term:Left side total:a^2 (b -18)^4 +36a (b -18)^2 h^2 +324 h^4 + a^2 h^2 (b -18)^2 -36a h^2 (b -18)^2 +324 h^2 (b -18)^2Combine like terms:- a^2 (b -18)^4 + a^2 h^2 (b -18)^2= a^2 (b -18)^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ]Then, the terms with 36a:36a (b -18)^2 h^2 -36a h^2 (b -18)^2 = 0Then, the constant terms:324 h^4 + 324 h^2 (b -18)^2 = 324 h^2 [ h^2 + (b -18)^2 ]Therefore, left side simplifies to:a^2 (b -18)^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ] + 324 h^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ]= [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ] [ a^2 (b -18)^2 + 324 h^2 ]Right side:a^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ]^2Therefore, equating left and right sides:[ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ] [ a^2 (b -18)^2 + 324 h^2 ] = a^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ]^2Divide both sides by [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ] (assuming it&#39;s non-zero, which it is because it&#39;s the sum of squares):a^2 (b -18)^2 + 324 h^2 = a^2 [ (b -18)^2 + h^2 ]Subtract a^2 (b -18)^2 from both sides:324 h^2 = a^2 h^2Therefore, 324 h^2 = a^2 h^2.Assuming h ≠ 0 (since it&#39;s a trapezoid, height can&#39;t be zero), we can divide both sides by h^2:324 = a^2Thus, a = ±18. Since length can&#39;t be negative, a = 18.Therefore, AD = 18.Wait, so after all that algebra, the key equation simplifies to 324 = a^2, so a = 18. That seems straightforward in the end. Let me verify if this makes sense.Let me recap. After setting up the coordinates and going through the equations, we ended up with 324 = a^2, so a = 18. Therefore, the length of AD is 18.But let&#39;s check if this is consistent with the other given information. Given that BC = 16, CM =8, MD=9, which sums CD=17. If AD=18, then the coordinates would be consistent?Wait, let&#39;s check with the coordinates. If a=18, then AD=18, so point A is at (18,0). Then, we need to verify if with this value, the other conditions hold.Given a=18, then the equation simplifies as follows.From the previous steps, we had 324 = a^2, so a=18.Now, we can check the coordinates. Let me see if we can find b and h.From CD&#39;s length: (b +16)^2 + h^2 = 289.From the other condition, we had h^2 = -b^2 -32b +33.Wait, h^2 = 289 - (b +16)^2.So, if a=18, does this affect b and h?But since a=18 is derived regardless of b and h, as long as h ≠0, which is true for a trapezoid.Therefore, even though we don&#39;t know the specific values of b and h, the conclusion is that AD=18.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{18}.But let me just cross-verify with another approach to ensure there&#39;s no mistake.Alternative approach:Since AD = HD and AH is perpendicular to BM, triangle AHD is isoceles with AD = HD. So, the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM is such that H is located at a distance AD from D. Maybe using reflections?In some geometry problems, reflecting a point over a line can help. For instance, since AH is perpendicular to BM and HD = AD, maybe reflecting point D over BM gives a point related to A.Alternatively, since HD = AD = 18, then H is located on the circle centered at D with radius 18. Also, H lies on BM and is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM. So, H is the intersection of BM with the circle centered at D radius 18, and also the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM.But since we found through coordinate geometry that a=18 regardless of other variables, maybe this is the correct answer.Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles or other properties.Alternatively, since AH is perpendicular to BM, and HD = AD = 18, then in triangle AHD, which is isoceles, the altitude AH is also the median and angle bisector. So, H is the midpoint of the arc? Not sure.But given the coordinate approach leads to a=18, and the problem is likely designed for an answer of 18, I think that&#39;s correct.Final Answerboxed{18}&lt;/think&gt;Given a trapezoid (ABCD) with (AD parallel BC), where (BC = 16), (CM = 8), and (MD = 9). A point (M) is on (CD) such that a perpendicular (AH) is dropped from vertex (A) to segment (BM), and it is given that (AD = HD). We need to find the length of segment (AD).1. Coordinate Setup:   - Place (D) at ((0, 0)) and (A) at ((a, 0)).   - Points (B) and (C) are at ((b, h)) and ((b + 16, h)) respectively.   - The length of (CD) is 17, giving the equation ((b + 16)^2 + h^2 = 289).2. Coordinates of (M):   - (M) divides (CD) in the ratio (8:9), so its coordinates are (left(frac{9(b + 16)}{17}, frac{9h}{17}right)).3. Equation of Line (BM):   - The slope of (BM) is (frac{h - frac{9h}{17}}{b - frac{9(b + 16)}{17}} = frac{h/(b - 18)}).   - The equation of (BM) is (y - h = frac{h}{b - 18}(x - b)).4. Perpendicular from (A) to (BM):   - The slope of (AH) is (-frac{b - 18}{h}).   - The equation of (AH) is (y = -frac{b - 18}{h}(x - a)).5. Intersection and Distance Condition:   - Solving the equations of (BM) and (AH) gives coordinates of (H).   - Using the distance condition (HD = AD = a), we derive the equation (x^2 + y^2 = a^2).6. Simplifying the Equations:   - After substituting and simplifying, we find that the key equation reduces to (324 = a^2), leading to (a = 18).Thus, the length of segment (AD) is (boxed{18}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. On side CD, there&#39;s a point M such that CM = 8 and MD = 9, making CD = 17. From vertex A, a perpendicular AH is dropped onto segment BM, and it&#39;s given that AD = HD. We need to find the length of AD, given that BC = 16. Hmm, let&#39;s visualize this first.Since AD is parallel to BC, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC. Point M is on CD, closer to C since CM is 8 and MD is 9. Then, AH is the perpendicular from A to BM, and H is the foot of this perpendicular. Also, HD equals AD. So, triangle AHD is isosceles with AD = HD. Interesting.Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let&#39;s set point D at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Since AD is parallel to BC, and AD is one of the bases, let&#39;s let AD be along the x-axis. So point A would be at (a, 0), where a is the length AD that we need to find. Wait, but if we set D at (0,0), then AD would be along the x-axis from D(0,0) to A(a,0). Then BC is the other base, which is parallel to AD, so BC must also be horizontal. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates of B and C. Since BC = 16, and the trapezoid has sides AB and DC.But where exactly are points B and C? Let&#39;s assume that the legs of the trapezoid are AB and DC. So, point C is on the same line as D, but since AD is parallel to BC, maybe I need to adjust the coordinates. Wait, trapezoid can be oriented in any way, but since AD is parallel to BC, and we set AD along the x-axis, BC should also be horizontal.Let me try setting up coordinates more carefully.Let’s place point D at (0,0). Since AD is a base, we can place point A at (k, 0), where k is the length AD we need to find. Then, since AD is parallel to BC, BC must also be horizontal. Let&#39;s assume that the height of the trapezoid (the distance between the two bases) is h. So, points B and C must be located somewhere above, such that BC is length 16 and is parallel to AD.But how to position them? Let&#39;s say point C is at (x, h), then point B would be at (x + 16, h) because BC = 16. Then, the sides AB and DC are the legs of the trapezoid. However, we also have point M on CD. Wait, CD is the side from C to D. So, CD connects point C(x, h) to D(0,0). Then, point M is on CD such that CM = 8 and MD = 9. Since CD has length 17, which is 8 + 9. Therefore, point M divides CD into segments of 8 and 9.To find coordinates of M, since CD is from C(x, h) to D(0,0), the coordinates of M can be found using section formula. Since CM:MD = 8:9, M divides CD in the ratio CM:MD = 8:9. Therefore, coordinates of M would be [(9 * x + 8 * 0)/(8 + 9), (9 * h + 8 * 0)/17] = (9x/17, 9h/17).But wait, we don&#39;t know x yet. Hmm, maybe we need another approach.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s better to set coordinates such that D is at (0,0), C is at (c,0), since CD is a side. Wait, but AD is parallel to BC. If AD is parallel to BC, and we take AD as the lower base, then BC must be the upper base. But in a trapezoid, the two bases are the two parallel sides. So, perhaps AD and BC are the two bases, with AD and BC both horizontal. Then, the legs are AB and CD.But in that case, if D is at (0,0), A would be at (k,0), then BC is the other base, which is parallel, so BC must be at some height h. Let&#39;s suppose point B is at (m, h) and point C is at (m + 16, h), since BC = 16. Then, CD connects C(m + 16, h) to D(0,0). Then, point M is on CD such that CM = 8 and MD = 9. So, CD has length 17, which is consistent with CM + MD.So, coordinates of M can be found by moving from C towards D, 8 units out of 17 total. So, parametric coordinates: starting at C(m + 16, h), moving towards D(0,0), the coordinates of M would be:x-coordinate: (m + 16) - (8/17)*(m + 16 - 0) = (m + 16)*(1 - 8/17) = (m + 16)*(9/17)y-coordinate: h - (8/17)*(h - 0) = h*(1 - 8/17) = h*(9/17)So, M is at ((9/17)(m + 16), (9/17)h)Alternatively, using the section formula: since CM:MD = 8:9, M divides CD internally in the ratio CM:MD = 8:9. Therefore, coordinates of M are [(9 * C + 8 * D)/17] = [9*(m + 16, h) + 8*(0,0)] / 17 = (9(m + 16)/17, 9h/17). So same as above.So, coordinates:A: (k, 0)D: (0, 0)C: (m + 16, h)B: (m, h)M: (9(m + 16)/17, 9h/17)Now, we need to find the coordinates of H, which is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM.First, let&#39;s write equations for BM and then find the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM.Coordinates of B: (m, h)Coordinates of M: (9(m + 16)/17, 9h/17)So, the line BM goes from (m, h) to (9(m + 16)/17, 9h/17). Let&#39;s find the equation of BM.First, compute the slope of BM.Slope of BM: (9h/17 - h)/(9(m + 16)/17 - m) = (-8h/17)/(9(m + 16) - 17m)/17) = (-8h/17)/(9m + 144 - 17m)/17 = (-8h/17)/(-8m + 144)/17 = (-8h)/(-8m + 144) = (8h)/(8m - 144) = h/(m - 18)Wait, simplifying numerator and denominator:Numerator: 9h/17 - h = (9h - 17h)/17 = (-8h)/17Denominator: 9(m +16)/17 - m = (9m + 144 -17m)/17 = (-8m +144)/17Therefore, slope is (-8h/17) / (-8m +144)/17 = (-8h)/(-8m +144) = 8h/(8m -144) = h/(m -18)So, the slope of BM is h/(m -18).Therefore, the equation of BM is:(y - h) = [h/(m -18)](x - m)Now, the foot of the perpendicular from A(k, 0) to BM is point H.To find H, we can use the formula for the foot of the perpendicular from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c =0.Alternatively, since we have the equation of BM, we can write it in standard form and use projection.First, let&#39;s write BM in standard form.Starting from the point-slope form:(y - h) = [h/(m -18)](x - m)Multiply both sides by (m -18):(m -18)(y - h) = h(x - m)Bring all terms to left side:h(x - m) - (m -18)(y - h) = 0Expand:h x - h m - (m -18)y + (m -18)h = 0Simplify:h x - h m - m y + 18 y + m h -18 h =0Combine like terms:h x - m y +18 y -18 h =0Factor:h x - y(m -18) -18 h =0So, equation of BM is h x - (m -18) y -18 h =0Therefore, standard form: h x - (m -18) y =18 hNow, the foot of the perpendicular from A(k,0) to BM can be calculated using the formula:If the line is ax + by + c =0, then the foot (H) from (x0,y0) is:H = ( (b(bx0 - ay0) - a c ) / (a² + b² ), (a(-bx0 + ay0) - b c ) / (a² + b² ) )But let me check. Alternatively, since we have BM: h x - (m -18)y =18 hSo, coefficients: a = h, b = -(m -18), c = -18 hWait, standard form is ax + by + c =0, so here h x - (m -18) y -18 h =0, so c = -18 hTherefore, foot of perpendicular from A(k,0):The formula for foot (H) is:x = k - h*(h k - (m -18)*0 -18 h)/(h² + (m -18)^2 )Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to recall the formula:Given line ax + by + c =0, the foot of the perpendicular from (x0, y0) is:(x, y) = (x0 - a*(a x0 + b y0 + c)/(a² + b²), y0 - b*(a x0 + b y0 + c)/(a² + b²))Yes, that formula is correct.So, here, a = h, b = -(m -18), c = -18 hCompute a x0 + b y0 + c = h*k + [-(m -18)]*0 + (-18 h) = h k -18 h = h(k -18)Therefore, the foot H is:x = k - h*(h(k -18))/(h² + (m -18)^2 )y = 0 - [-(m -18)]*(h(k -18))/(h² + (m -18)^2 )Simplify:x = k - [h² (k -18)] / [h² + (m -18)^2 ]y = [ (m -18) h (k -18) ] / [h² + (m -18)^2 ]So, coordinates of H are:Hx = k - [h² (k -18)] / [h² + (m -18)^2 ]Hy = [ (m -18) h (k -18) ] / [h² + (m -18)^2 ]Now, given that HD = AD. Since AD is the length from A(k,0) to D(0,0), which is sqrt(k² +0) =k. HD is the distance from H to D(0,0), which is sqrt(Hx² + Hy²). Therefore, HD = AD implies sqrt(Hx² + Hy²) =k. Therefore, Hx² + Hy² =k².So, let&#39;s compute Hx² + Hy² and set it equal to k².First, compute Hx:Hx =k - [h² (k -18)] / [h² + (m -18)^2 ]Let me denote denominator as Q = h² + (m -18)^2Then, Hx =k - [h² (k -18)] / Q = [k Q - h²(k -18)] / QSimilarly, Hy = [ (m -18) h (k -18) ] / QTherefore, Hx² + Hy² = [k Q - h²(k -18)]² / Q² + [ (m -18) h (k -18) ]² / Q²Factor out 1/Q²:[ (k Q - h²(k -18))² + ( (m -18) h (k -18) )² ] / Q² =k²Multiply both sides by Q²:(k Q - h²(k -18))² + ( (m -18) h (k -18) )² =k² Q²Expand the left side:First term: (k Q - h²(k -18))²= k² Q² - 2k Q h²(k -18) + h^4 (k -18)^2Second term: [ (m -18) h (k -18) ]² = (m -18)^2 h² (k -18)^2Therefore, left side becomes:k² Q² - 2k Q h²(k -18) + h^4 (k -18)^2 + (m -18)^2 h² (k -18)^2= k² Q² - 2k Q h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 [ h² + (m -18)^2 ]But note that Q = h² + (m -18)^2Therefore, left side is:k² Q² - 2k Q h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 QFactor out Q:Q [ k² Q - 2k h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 ]But this is supposed to equal k² Q². Therefore,Q [ k² Q - 2k h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 ] =k² Q²Divide both sides by Q (assuming Q ≠0, which it isn&#39;t because h and m can&#39;t make denominator zero):k² Q - 2k h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 =k² QSubtract k² Q from both sides:-2k h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 =0Factor out h² (k -18):h² (k -18) [ -2k + (k -18) ] =0Simplify inside the brackets:-2k +k -18 = -k -18Therefore:h² (k -18)( -k -18 ) =0So, the equation becomes:h² (k -18)( -k -18 ) =0Therefore, solutions when h²=0, which would collapse the trapezoid to a line, impossible.Or (k -18)=0 =&gt; k=18, or (-k -18)=0 =&gt;k=-18. Since lengths can&#39;t be negative, k=18 is the only solution.Therefore, AD =k=18. So, the length of AD is 18.Wait, but let me verify this. The algebra led us to k=18 regardless of other variables? That seems surprising. Let me check the steps again.We started by assuming coordinates with D at (0,0), A at (k,0), B at (m,h), C at (m+16,h). Then M is at (9(m+16)/17,9h/17). Then, we found the equation of BM, then found foot H of perpendicular from A to BM. Then, HD = AD implies that distance from H to D is k. Then, after expanding, we ended up with k=18. So, according to this, AD is 18. But is there a possibility that I missed some constraints?Wait, but in the problem statement, BC=16, CM=8, MD=9. We have BC=16, which we accounted for. The other given is that AD=HD, which we used. But we didn&#39;t use any specific relationships about the sides AB or DC. So, the result k=18 is independent of the other variables h and m. That seems odd. But according to the algebra, it&#39;s correct.Alternatively, maybe there was an error in the algebra. Let&#39;s check:After expanding Hx² + Hy² =k², we ended up with:h² (k -18)( -k -18 ) =0Which implies k=18 or k=-18. Since k is positive, k=18. So, the answer is 18. That seems straightforward. So, maybe 18 is the correct answer. Let me see if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem that could confirm it.Alternatively, using vectors or coordinate-free geometry. Let&#39;s think.Since AD is parallel to BC, and AD=HD, triangle AHD is isosceles with AD=HD. Also, AH is perpendicular to BM. Maybe we can use some properties of reflections or right triangles.Alternatively, since AH is perpendicular to BM and HD=AD, perhaps triangle AHD has some orthocenter properties. But maybe coordinate geometry was the right approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider triangle ABM. Since AH is the altitude from A to BM, and H is such that HD=AD. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, since HD=AD, point H lies on the circle centered at D with radius AD. So, H is the intersection of BM with the circle centered at D with radius AD. Also, AH is perpendicular to BM. So, AH is tangent to the circle at H, because the radius DH is perpendicular to AH. Wait, if AH is perpendicular to DH, but DH is the radius. Wait, AH is perpendicular to BM, not necessarily to DH. Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, since AH is perpendicular to BM and HD=AD, maybe there&#39;s a reflection involved. If we reflect point A over H, but not sure.Alternatively, in coordinate geometry, we obtained AD=18 regardless of h and m. But how is that possible? Because in the trapezoid, the positions of B and C could vary, affecting the position of M and hence H. But according to the algebra, AD must be 18. Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation, AD=18.But let me test with an example. Suppose AD=18, so k=18. Let me choose some arbitrary h and m to see if the conditions hold.Let&#39;s take h=17, m=1 (arbitrary). Then, BC=16, so point C is at (1+16,17)=(17,17). Point M is on CD. CD is from (17,17) to (0,0). CM=8, MD=9. So, coordinates of M would be (9*17/17,9*17/17)=(9,9). Wait, because using section formula: M divides CD in ratio CM:MD=8:9. So, coordinates of M=(9*17 +8*0)/17, (9*17 +8*0)/17)=(9,9). Wait, but CD is from C(17,17) to D(0,0), so M is 8 units from C and 9 units from D. Coordinates are (9,9). Then, BM is the line from B(1,17) to M(9,9). The slope of BM is (9-17)/(9-1)=(-8)/8=-1. Equation of BM: y -17 = -1(x -1) → y = -x +18.Foot of perpendicular from A(18,0) to BM. The line BM is y = -x +18. The slope of BM is -1, so the perpendicular has slope 1. Equation of perpendicular: y -0=1*(x -18) → y =x -18.Intersection point H is where y = -x +18 and y =x -18. Solve:x -18 = -x +18 → 2x=36 → x=18, then y=0. Wait, that&#39;s point A(18,0). But H is supposed to be the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM. If the foot is at A itself, that would mean that A lies on BM. But in this case, BM is the line y = -x +18. At x=18, y=0, which is point A. So, H coincides with A. But HD=AD would imply that distance from H=A to D is AD=18, which is true, but the problem states that AH is the perpendicular from A to BM. If A is on BM, then the perpendicular from A to BM is just A itself. However, in the problem statement, it&#39;s implied that AH is a perpendicular, but not necessarily distinct from A. However, in this case, with AD=18, the construction results in H=A, which might be a degenerate case. But according to the problem statement, is this allowed?Wait, the problem says &quot;a perpendicular AH is dropped from vertex A to segment BM&quot;. If H is the foot of the perpendicular, then if A lies on BM, then H=A. However, in that case, HD=AD would mean that the distance from A to D is equal to AD, which is trivially true. But in this specific example, when we set AD=18, H coincides with A. But in the problem, is this acceptable? The problem doesn&#39;t specify that H is different from A. However, if H=A, then AH is a zero-length segment, but the problem says &quot;a perpendicular is dropped&quot;, which typically implies a non-degenerate perpendicular. Therefore, perhaps this suggests that my coordinate setup is leading to a degenerate case when AD=18, meaning that maybe there is an error in the algebra.Wait, this example leads to H=A, which might not be acceptable. Therefore, maybe the answer is not 18. So, where is the mistake?Wait, in this example, with AD=18, BC=16, CM=8, MD=9, but in reality, in this coordinate setup, the trapezoid would have AD=18 and BC=16. But with point M on CD such that CM=8, MD=9. Then, BM is from B(1,17) to M(9,9). Then, AH is the perpendicular from A(18,0) to BM, which in this case is point A itself. So, H=A. But the problem says &quot;a perpendicular AH is dropped from vertex A to segment BM&quot;, so if H=A, it&#39;s a degenerate perpendicular. Therefore, the problem likely requires H to be a distinct point from A. Therefore, my previous conclusion that AD=18 might be invalid, as it leads to a degenerate case. Hence, there must be a mistake in my algebra.Wait, let&#39;s check the algebra again. The key equation came down to:h² (k -18)( -k -18 ) =0Which gives k=18 or k=-18. Since k&gt;0, k=18. But in the example, this gives a degenerate case. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in the algebra.Let me trace back the steps. Starting from Hx² + Hy² =k². After expanding, we arrived at:h² (k -18)( -k -18 ) =0But let&#39;s check this step:From:-2k h²(k -18) + h² (k -18)^2 =0Factor h² (k -18):h² (k -18)[-2k + (k -18)] =0Which simplifies to:h² (k -18)(-k -18) =0Yes, that&#39;s correct. So, the equation simplifies to h² (k -18)(-k -18) =0. So, unless h=0, which is impossible, then k=18 or k=-18.But in the example, h=17≠0, so k=18 is the solution. However, in that case, H coincides with A. So, perhaps the problem allows H=A, but then HD=AD is trivial. But in the problem statement, it says &quot;a perpendicular AH is dropped from vertex A to segment BM&quot;. If H is A, then AH is a zero-length segment, which is still technically a perpendicular, but maybe the problem implies that H is on BM distinct from A. Therefore, my answer might be incorrect.Alternatively, maybe my coordinate setup is flawed. Let&#39;s try a different coordinate system.Alternative approach: Let me place the trapezoid such that AD is the lower base, BC is the upper base. Let&#39;s set D at (0,0), A at (a,0). Let the height of the trapezoid be h, so B is at (b,h), C is at (c,h). Since BC=16, the length BC is |c - b|=16. Then, CD is from C(c,h) to D(0,0). Point M divides CD such that CM=8 and MD=9. Therefore, coordinates of M can be found by section formula: since CM:MD=8:9, M= (9*c +8*0)/17, (9*h +8*0)/17)=(9c/17,9h/17). So, coordinates of M are (9c/17,9h/17).Then, BM is the line from B(b,h) to M(9c/17,9h/17). The slope of BM is (9h/17 - h)/(9c/17 - b) = (-8h/17)/(9c/17 - b) = (-8h)/(9c -17b). The equation of BM is y - h = [(-8h)/(9c -17b)](x - b).The foot of the perpendicular from A(a,0) to BM is point H. The coordinates of H can be found by solving the system of equations: the line BM and the line perpendicular to BM passing through A.But this might get complicated. Let&#39;s instead use vectors.Let vector BM = M - B = (9c/17 - b, 9h/17 - h) = ((9c -17b)/17, -8h/17)The direction vector of BM is (9c -17b, -8h). The direction vector of AH is perpendicular to BM, so it has direction (8h, 9c -17b). Therefore, parametric equation of AH is A + t*(8h, 9c -17b). This line intersects BM at H.But H is on BM, which can be parametrized as B + s*(BM direction). So, H = B + s*(9c -17b, -8h)/17.Set this equal to A + t*(8h, 9c -17b):(b + s*(9c -17b)/17, h + s*(-8h)/17) = (a + 8h t, 0 + (9c -17b) t)Therefore, equations:b + s*(9c -17b)/17 = a +8h t  ...(1)h -8h s/17 = (9c -17b) t ...(2)We need to solve for s and t.From equation (2):h -8h s/17 = (9c -17b) tLet&#39;s solve for t:t = [h -8h s/17]/(9c -17b)Plug into equation (1):b + s*(9c -17b)/17 = a +8h * [h -8h s/17]/(9c -17b)Multiply both sides by (9c -17b):(9c -17b)(b + s*(9c -17b)/17) = 8h [h -8h s/17 ]Expand left side:b(9c -17b) + s*(9c -17b)^2 /17Right side:8h^2 - (64 h^2 s)/17Bring all terms to left side:b(9c -17b) + s*(9c -17b)^2 /17 -8h^2 + (64 h^2 s)/17 =0Factor terms with s:s [ (9c -17b)^2 /17 +64 h^2 /17 ] + [9b c -17b^2 -8h^2 ]=0Factor 1/17:s [ (9c -17b)^2 +64 h^2 ] /17 + (9b c -17b^2 -8h^2 )=0Multiply both sides by 17:s [ (9c -17b)^2 +64 h^2 ] +17(9b c -17b^2 -8h^2 )=0Solve for s:s= -17(9b c -17b^2 -8h^2 ) / [ (9c -17b)^2 +64 h^2 ]This is getting quite complicated. Now, we need to use the condition HD=AD. Since D is at (0,0), and H is the foot of the perpendicular from A(a,0) to BM, HD is the distance from H to D, which equals AD=a. So,sqrt( (Hx)^2 + (Hy)^2 ) =aTherefore,Hx^2 + Hy^2 =a^2But H is on BM, so H=(b + s*(9c -17b)/17, h -8h s/17 )Therefore,Hx =b + s*(9c -17b)/17Hy =h -8h s/17So,(b + s*(9c -17b)/17)^2 + (h -8h s/17)^2 =a^2This is another equation involving s, which we can substitute from earlier. However, this seems very involved. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Wait, let&#39;s recall that in coordinate geometry earlier, we obtained that AD=18 regardless of other variables, but in an example, that led to a degenerate case. Therefore, perhaps the problem has AD=18 as the answer, but the degenerate case is actually acceptable. Maybe in the problem&#39;s configuration, H coincides with A, making AH zero, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify that H is distinct from A. However, in most geometric problems, a perpendicular dropped from a point to a segment implies that the foot is on the segment, but not necessarily distinct. However, if A is on BM, then the foot is A itself, so HD=AD is trivial. But is this the only solution?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another solution where H is not A. However, according to the algebra, the only solution is k=18. So, perhaps despite the degenerate case, the answer is 18.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider another example. Suppose AD=18, BC=16, and point M such that CM=8, MD=9. Let me choose coordinates such that AD is horizontal, D at (0,0), A at (18,0). Let the height of the trapezoid be h=9. Then, points B and C would be at (something,9). Let&#39;s let B be at (b,9), so C is at (b+16,9). Then, CD is from (b+16,9) to (0,0). Point M divides CD in ratio CM:MD=8:9. Therefore, coordinates of M are (9*(b+16)/17, 9*9/17)=(9(b+16)/17, 81/17).Then, BM is the line from B(b,9) to M(9(b+16)/17,81/17). Let&#39;s compute the slope of BM:Slope = (81/17 -9)/(9(b+16)/17 -b ) = (81/17 -153/17)/(9b +144)/17 -17b/17 )= (-72/17)/( -8b +144)/17 ) = (-72)/(-8b +144)= 9/(b -18)So, slope of BM is 9/(b -18). Then, the equation of BM is y -9= [9/(b -18)](x -b)The foot of the perpendicular from A(18,0) to BM is point H. Let&#39;s compute H.The line BM has slope m=9/(b -18), so the perpendicular has slope - (b -18)/9.Equation of the perpendicular from A(18,0): y = - (b -18)/9 (x -18)Intersection with BM:y =9 + [9/(b -18)](x -b )Set equal to y= - (b -18)/9 (x -18)Therefore,9 + [9/(b -18)](x -b ) = - (b -18)/9 (x -18)Multiply both sides by 9(b -18) to eliminate denominators:9*9(b -18) + 9*9(x -b ) = - (b -18)^2 (x -18 )Simplify:81(b -18) +81(x -b ) = - (b -18)^2 (x -18 )Left side:81b - 1458 +81x -81b =81x -1458Right side: - (b -18)^2 x +18(b -18)^2Therefore:81x -1458 = - (b -18)^2 x +18(b -18)^2Bring all terms to left:81x -1458 + (b -18)^2 x -18(b -18)^2 =0Factor x:x(81 + (b -18)^2 ) -1458 -18(b -18)^2 =0Solve for x:x = [1458 +18(b -18)^2 ] / [81 + (b -18)^2 ]= [18*81 +18(b -18)^2 ] / [81 + (b -18)^2 ]=18[81 + (b -18)^2 ] / [81 + (b -18)^2 ] =18Therefore, x=18. Then, substitute back into y= - (b -18)/9 (x -18)=0. Therefore, H=(18,0), which is point A. So, again, H coincides with A.Thus, regardless of the choice of b (position of B), the foot of the perpendicular from A to BM is A itself when AD=18. Therefore, this suggests that the only solution is AD=18, even though it results in a degenerate perpendicular. Therefore, the answer is 18.But the problem says &quot;a perpendicular AH is dropped from vertex A to segment BM&quot;. If H is A, then AH has length zero, but technically, a perpendicular can be of zero length if the point is on the line. However, in the context of the problem, since it&#39;s stated that a perpendicular is dropped, maybe the problem assumes that H is a distinct point. Therefore, there might be a contradiction, suggesting that our answer is wrong.But according to the algebra, it&#39;s the only solution. Perhaps the problem is designed such that despite the degenerate case, the answer is 18. Alternatively, maybe there is a different interpretation.Wait, let&#39;s revisit the coordinate setup. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning coordinates. Let&#39;s try another approach.Let me consider that AD and BC are the two bases, with AD parallel to BC. Let’s construct the trapezoid such that AD is the lower base and BC is the upper base. Let’s place point D at (0,0), point A at (a,0). Let the height of the trapezoid be h, so points B and C are at some (p,h) and (q,h), respectively, with BC=16, so q -p=16. Then, CD is from C(q,h) to D(0,0). Point M is on CD such that CM=8 and MD=9. Then, coordinates of M are ( (9*q +8*0)/17, (9*h +8*0)/17 )=(9q/17,9h/17). Now, BM is the line from B(p,h) to M(9q/17,9h/17). The slope of BM is (9h/17 -h)/(9q/17 -p)= (-8h/17)/(9q/17 -p)= (-8h)/(9q -17p). The equation of BM is y -h = [ (-8h)/(9q -17p) ](x -p). The foot of the perpendicular from A(a,0) to BM is H. The condition is that HD=AD=a.Let’s compute H. The coordinates of H can be found by solving the system:1. The line BM: y = [ (-8h)/(9q -17p) ](x -p) +h2. The perpendicular from A(a,0) to BM has slope reciprocal of the slope of BM: m_perp = (9q -17p)/(8h)Equation of the perpendicular: y = [ (9q -17p)/(8h) ](x -a)Intersection point H is the solution to:[ (-8h)/(9q -17p) ](x -p) +h = [ (9q -17p)/(8h) ](x -a)Multiply both sides by 8h(9q -17p) to eliminate denominators:-8h*8h(x -p) +8h(9q -17p)*h = (9q -17p)^2 (x -a)Simplify left side:-64h²(x -p) +8h²(9q -17p )Right side:(9q -17p)^2 (x -a)Bring all terms to left:-64h²(x -p) +8h²(9q -17p ) - (9q -17p)^2 (x -a)=0Factor terms:x(-64h² - (9q -17p)^2 ) + [64h²p +8h²(9q -17p ) + (9q -17p)^2 a ]=0Solve for x:x = [64h²p +8h²(9q -17p ) + (9q -17p)^2 a ] / [64h² + (9q -17p)^2 ]Similarly, substitute x into the perpendicular equation to find y.But this is very complicated. However, the condition HD=AD implies that sqrt(x_H² + y_H²)=a. Plugging in x and y in terms of variables p, q, h, a.This seems too involved. Alternatively, note that in all coordinate systems tried, the only solution that satisfies HD=AD is a=18, regardless of other parameters, even if it leads to H=A. Therefore, despite the degenerate case, the answer must be 18.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that when AD=18, H coincides with A, and thus HD=AD is satisfied. Even though it&#39;s a degenerate case, mathematically it&#39;s a valid solution, so the answer is 18.Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches confirming the algebra, the length of AD is 18.Final Answerboxed{18}&lt;/think&gt;Given a trapezoid (ABCD) with (AD parallel BC), where (BC = 16), (CM = 8), and (MD = 9). A point (M) is marked on side (CD), and a perpendicular (AH) is dropped from vertex (A) to segment (BM). It is given that (AD = HD). We need to find the length of segment (AD).1. Coordinate Setup:   - Place (D) at ((0, 0)) and (A) at ((a, 0)) where (a = AD).   - Points (B) and (C) are positioned such that (BC = 16) and are parallel to (AD). Let (B) be at ((m, h)) and (C) at ((m + 16, h)).2. Coordinates of (M):   - Since (CM = 8) and (MD = 9), point (M) divides (CD) in the ratio (8:9). Using the section formula, coordinates of (M) are (left(frac{9(m + 16)}{17}, frac{9h}{17}right)).3. Equation of Line (BM):   - Slope of (BM) is (frac{frac{9h}{17} - h}{frac{9(m + 16)}{17} - m} = frac{-8h/17}{-8m + 144/17} = frac{h}{m - 18}).   - Equation of (BM): (y - h = frac{h}{m - 18}(x - m)).4. Foot of Perpendicular from (A) to (BM):   - The foot of the perpendicular (H) from (A(a, 0)) to (BM) is calculated. Using the formula for the foot of the perpendicular, coordinates of (H) are derived.5. Condition (HD = AD):   - Distance (HD) must equal (AD). After algebraic manipulation and simplification, it is found that the only solution for (a) (length of (AD)) is (18), regardless of other parameters.6. Verification:   - Despite potential degenerate cases where (H) coincides with (A), the algebraic solution confirms that (AD = 18) is the valid answer.Thus, the length of segment (AD) is (boxed{18}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-94f6092c></div><p class="review-content" data-v-94f6092c><span class="icon" data-v-94f6092c>🔑:</span>Answer: 18.Solution.
