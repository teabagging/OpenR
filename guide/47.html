恒等旋转（1个）- 绕顶点到对面中心的轴旋转120度和240度的旋转，每个轴有两个非恒等旋转，共有四个轴，所以应该是4×2=8个这样的旋转？不过可能我记错了，或者需要再仔细分析一下。不对，正四面体的对称群（旋转群）的正确阶数应该是12。具体来说，正四面体有4个顶点，每个顶点对应一个轴，穿过顶点和对面面的中心。绕每个这样的轴旋转120度和240度，这样每个轴有两个非恒等旋转，因此共有4个轴×2个旋转=8个旋转，加上恒等旋转，总共有1+8=9个元素？这显然不对，因为我知道正四面体的对称群应该是12个元素。可能我的分析有问题。让我再仔细想想。正四面体的对称群同构于交错群A4，阶数为12。这可能包括绕轴旋转以及其他的对称操作。不过具体来说，正确的旋转数目应该是：- 恒等旋转：1个- 绕每个顶点到对面中心的轴旋转120度和240度，共有4个顶点，每个轴对应两种旋转，所以应该是4×2=8个？- 另外还有绕对边中点的轴旋转180度的旋转。正四面体有6条边，但每条边对应的中点轴是否有旋转对称呢？不过可能我的这个思路有问题，因为正四面体的边中点轴可能并不都是独立的。正确的正四面体旋转对称群的结构应该是：- 1个恒等元素- 8个绕顶点到面中心轴的120度和240度旋转- 3个绕对边中点轴的180度旋转这样的话，1 + 8 + 3 = 12个元素，符合阶数12。这样看来，正四面体的旋转群共有12个元素，包括：1）恒等旋转：1个；2）绕四个顶点到对面中心的轴各旋转120度和240度，每个轴对应两个旋转，共4个轴×2=8个；3）绕三条对边中点轴的180度旋转，共3个。不过需要确认正四面体是否确实有这样的对称轴。每条对边中点轴是否存在呢？比如，正四面体中有6条边，其中每两条边如果是对边的话（即没有公共顶点的边），可能存在三个这样的对边对，每个对边对的中点连线作为旋转轴，旋转180度会将这两个边交换位置。这样的话，这样的轴有三个，每个对应一个180度旋转。所以这部分应该正确。接下来，我要计算在颜色配置（每个面和顶点都是红或蓝）的情况下，不同的涂色方案数，其中通过旋转可以互相转化的视为同一种。这时候应该使用Burnside引理，即计算所有群元素的不动点数目的平均数。Burnside引理的公式是：轨道数目（即不同的涂色方案数）= 1/|G| × Σ_{g∈G} fix(g)，其中fix(g)是在群元素g作用下保持颜色不变的涂色数目。这里的颜色配置对象是正四面体的四个面和四个顶点，每个都要涂红或蓝。不过题目中是否将面和顶点分开考虑颜色呢？题目里说“每个面”和“每个顶点”都涂色，所以颜色配置是面的颜色加上顶点的颜色的组合。也就是说，每个面有一个颜色（红或蓝），每个顶点也有一个颜色（红或蓝）。所以总共有（2^4）种面颜色组合和（2^4）种顶点颜色组合，因此总的颜色配置数是2^4 × 2^4 = 2^8 = 256种。但我们需要考虑在旋转群作用下这些颜色配置被分为多少个不同的轨道。不过这里可能需要将面和顶点的颜色分开处理，或者当作一个整体的颜色配置。即每个面有颜色，每个顶点也有颜色，所以整个结构是面颜色和顶点颜色的组合。因此，当应用Burnside引理时，我们需要考虑每个群元素g，其作用在面上和顶点上的颜色配置是否同时保持不变。也就是说，对于每个群元素g，它的作用会导致面的置换和顶点的置换。如果存在颜色配置在g的作用下，面的颜色被对应的置换后的面颜色相同，同时顶点的颜色也被对应的置换后的顶点颜色相同，那么这个颜色配置就是被g固定的。因此，fix(g)的数量等于在g作用下，面颜色不变的面颜色组合数目乘以顶点颜色不变的顶点颜色组合数目。因此，我们可以分别计算面颜色在g作用下的不动点数目和顶点颜色在g作用下的不动点数目，然后相乘得到总的fix(g)。最后将每个群元素g的fix(g)相加，再除以群的大小12，得到答案。接下来需要分析每个群元素g的类型，然后分别计算其对于面颜色和顶点颜色的不动点数目。首先，群元素的类型有：1. 恒等元素（1个）2. 绕顶点到面中心轴的120度旋转（8个）3. 绕对边中点轴的180度旋转（3个）接下来分别处理这三种类型的群元素。首先，恒等元素：显然，任何颜色配置都会被恒等元素保持，因此fix(恒等元素) = 2^4（面的颜色数目） × 2^4（顶点的颜色数目）= 256。接下来是绕顶点到面中心轴的120度旋转。每个这样的旋转会将三个面循环置换，同时也会将三个顶点循环置换，剩下一个顶点和对应的面保持不变。需要具体分析一下。例如，考虑绕顶点A到对面面中心的轴旋转120度。这样，顶点A保持不变，而另外三个顶点B、C、D会被循环置换（比如B→C→D→B？或者具体是怎样的）。同样，对应的四个面中，有一个面是底面（对应顶点A的面），保持不变，而另外三个侧面（每个侧面包含顶点A和另外两个顶点）会被循环置换。不过这里可能需要更准确的分析。首先，正四面体有四个面，每个面对应一个顶点，即每个面是正三角形，对应不包含该顶点的三个顶点。例如，顶点A对应的面是BCD面，顶点B对应的面是ACD面，等等。当绕顶点A到面BCD中心的轴旋转120度时，顶点A保持不动，而顶点B、C、D会被旋转120度。同样，面BCD保持不动（因为该轴穿过这个面的中心），而其他三个面（对应顶点B、C、D的面）会被循环置换。例如，面ACD（对应顶点B）会被旋转到面ABD的位置，面ABD（对应顶点C）会被旋转到面ABC的位置，面ABC（对应顶点D）会被旋转到面ACD的位置。或者可能具体的置换方式有所不同，需要仔细考虑。同样，顶点B、C、D会被循环置换，比如B→C→D→B这样的循环。如果是这样的话，顶点置换是一个3-循环，而面置换也是一个3-循环，涉及三个面，另一个面保持不动。同样，绕顶点到面中心轴的旋转120度，这样的群元素会将三个顶点循环置换，同时将三个对应的面循环置换，剩下的顶点和面保持不动。接下来，对于这样的旋转g，面颜色要保持不变的话，需要被循环置换的三个面颜色相同，而剩下的那个面颜色可以任意。同样，顶点颜色也需要被循环置换的三个顶点颜色相同，剩下的顶点颜色可以任意。因此，对于这种类型的群元素g（共8个，每个对应绕某个顶点到面中心轴的120度和240度旋转），其不动点数目fix(g)应该是：面颜色必须满足被循环的三个面颜色相同，另一个面颜色任意。因此，面颜色的不动点数目是2（被循环的三个面颜色相同，可以选择红或蓝） × 2（剩下的那个面颜色任意）。即2×2=4种。同样，顶点颜色的不动点数目也是2（被循环的三个顶点颜色相同） ×2（剩下的顶点颜色任意）=4种。所以，总的fix(g)=4×4=16种。不过需要确认是否正确。因为如果面被三个循环置换，那么这三个面必须颜色相同，另一个面可以任意。同样的，顶点被三个循环置换，这三个顶点颜色必须相同，另一个顶点颜色任意。所以确实，每个部分的不动点数目是4，相乘得到16。对于每个这样的旋转元素，不管旋转的是120度还是240度，因为都是生成一个3-循环，所以其不动点数目应该是相同的。因此，对于这8个旋转元素中的每一个，fix(g)=16。因此，这8个元素的总贡献是8×16=128。接下来考虑绕对边中点轴的180度旋转，共有3个这样的元素。每个这样的旋转将交换两对顶点和两对面。需要具体分析。例如，考虑一条对边，比如连接边AB和边CD的中点轴，绕这条轴旋转180度。此时，顶点A和B会被交换，顶点C和D会被交换。同样，对应的面也会被交换。具体来说，面ABD和面ABC可能被交换，而面ACD和面BCD也可能被交换，或者其他组合，需要更仔细的分析。不过更准确地说，绕对边中点轴旋转180度，会导致两对顶点被交换，同时两对面被交换。例如，边AB的中点轴旋转180度，可能会交换顶点C和D，同时交换顶点A和B？或者可能交换其他顶点对？这里可能需要更详细的分析。例如，正四面体的边AB，其中点轴旋转180度，将交换顶点C和D，并且交换顶点A和B吗？或者是否有其他置换方式？或者，可能绕边AB的中点轴旋转180度，交换顶点A和B，而顶点C和D保持不变？不过这不太可能，因为正四面体的对称性更高。正确的应该是，绕边AB的中点轴旋转180度，会交换顶点C和D，同时交换顶点A和B的位置吗？或者是否交换其他结构？或者考虑正四面体的顶点为A、B、C、D。假设边AB的对边是CD，那么绕边AB的中点轴旋转180度，将交换顶点C和D，同时交换顶点A和B吗？或者，可能这样的旋转会将顶点A映射到B，B映射到A，同时顶点C映射到D，D映射到C。这样顶点置换是两个交换，即置换类型是(AB)(CD)。同样，对应的面也会被置换。每个面由三个顶点组成，例如面ACD会被映射到面BCD，因为顶点C→D，D→C，A→B，所以原来的面ACD的三个顶点A、C、D被映射到B、D、C，即成为面BDC，也就是面BCD，因为顶点顺序不影响面的定义。同样，面BCD会被映射到面ACD。同样，面ABC会被映射到面BAD，但BAD可能对应另一个面，或者可能置换其他面。不过更准确地说，绕边AB的中点轴旋转180度，顶点A和B被交换，顶点C和D被交换。这样，面的置换也会发生变化。例如，面ACD会被交换到面BCD，面BCD会被交换到面ACD；同样，面ABC会被交换到面BAD（即面ABD），而面ABD会被交换到面BAC（即面ABC）。可能这样的置换导致两对面被交换：面ACD和BCD交换，面ABC和ABD交换。因此，面的置换是两个交换，即(ACD BCD)(ABC ABD)。因此，面的置换由两个独立的交换组成，即两个2-循环；同样，顶点的置换也是两个独立的交换，即(AB)(CD)。因此，对于这样的180度旋转，面颜色要保持不变的话，被交换的两个面必须颜色相同，同样另一对交换的面也必须颜色相同。而顶点颜色同样需要被交换的两个顶点颜色相同，另一对交换的顶点颜色也相同。因此，面颜色的不动点数目：每个被交换的面对必须颜色相同，共有两对，每对有2种选择（红或蓝），所以面颜色的不动点数目是2×2=4种。同样，顶点颜色的不动点数目也是两个交换对，每个对颜色相同，所以也是2×2=4种。因此，总的fix(g)=4×4=16种。每个这样的180度旋转元素（共有3个）的fix(g)都是16，所以3个元素的总贡献是3×16=48。现在，将所有群元素的fix(g)相加：- 恒等元素：256- 8个120/240度旋转：8×16=128- 3个180度旋转：3×16=48总和为256 + 128 + 48 = 432然后，应用Burnside引理，轨道数目=432 / 12 = 36.所以答案应该是36种不同的涂色方法。不过，我需要再次检查我的分析是否正确，尤其是在处理各个群元素的不动点数目时是否存在错误。首先，对于恒等元素，显然正确，所有颜色配置都被保持，所以数目是2^4×2^4=256。接下来，对于绕顶点到面中心轴的120度旋转，这样的旋转将三个顶点循环置换，剩下的一个顶点不变，同时三个面被循环置换，剩下的一个面不变。这时，顶点颜色需要被循环的三个顶点颜色相同，剩下的一个可以任意；面颜色同理。因此，顶点颜色不动点数目是2（三个循环顶点颜色相同）×2（剩下的顶点颜色任意）=4；面颜色同样为4，所以总的fix(g)=4×4=16，每个这样的元素都是这样的，共8个元素，所以总贡献正确。对于绕对边中点轴的180度旋转，导致顶点置换为两个交换对，面置换也是两个交换对。这时，顶点颜色需要每对交换的顶点颜色相同，共两对，每对有两种选择，即2×2=4；同样，面颜色也需要每对交换的面颜色相同，即2×2=4，所以fix(g)=4×4=16，每个这样的元素贡献16，3个元素总贡献48。将所有加起来得到256+128+48=432，除以12得到36，结果正确。所以答案应该是36种不同的涂色方法，用boxed{36}表示。不过，我再考虑是否可能哪里出错了。例如，是否在分析面的置换或顶点的置换时出现了错误？比如，在绕顶点到面中心轴旋转120度时，是否确实三个面被循环，另一个面保持不变？例如，考虑顶点A到面BCD中心的轴，旋转120度时，面BCD保持不变吗？实际上，当绕这个轴旋转时，面BCD（对应顶点A）应该会被保持，因为它围绕这个轴旋转，而其他三个面（对应顶点B、C、D的面）会被循环。例如，对应顶点B的面是ACD，对应顶点C的面是ABD，对应顶点D的面是ABC。当绕顶点A轴旋转120度时，这三个面会被循环：ACD→ABD→ABC→ACD？或者说不同的顺序？可能需要更准确的分析：绕顶点A到面BCD中心的轴旋转120度，会使得顶点B→C，C→D，D→B，对吗？如果是这样的话，对应顶点B的面ACD会被旋转到对应顶点C的位置，即面ABD？或者可能需要更仔细的几何分析。不过无论如何，无论如何置换，三个面会被循环，而另一个面保持不变，同样的三个顶点被循环，另一个顶点保持不变。因此，不管具体的循环顺序如何，三个面必须颜色相同，顶点同理，因此不动点数目是4×4=16，每个这样的旋转元素都是这样的。同样，绕对边中点轴的180度旋转交换两对顶点和两对面，导致每个交换对颜色必须相同，因此每个这样的元素fix(g)=16，这也没有问题。所以最终的结果是36，应该正确。不过，为了确保万无一失，我再次检查计算是否正确：恒等元素：1个，fix=2568个旋转120/240度的元素，每个fix=16，总和8×16=1283个旋转180度的元素，每个fix=16，总和3×16=48总和256+128+48=432432除以12（群的大小）得到36。没错。所以答案应该是36。不过，可能我在这里存在一个误区，即把顶点和面的颜色分开考虑，但实际上题目是将顶点和面同时涂色，所以当应用Burnside引理时，是否应该将整个颜色配置视为一个整体，即每个群元素的作用同时作用于顶点和面，因此不动点的数目是顶点颜色配置不动点数目乘以面颜色配置不动点数目？是的，这正是我刚才的计算方式，分开计算顶点和面的不动点数目，然后相乘，因为颜色配置是顶点颜色和面颜色的组合，而群元素的作用是同时作用于顶点和面的，所以只有当顶点颜色配置在群元素作用下不变，且面颜色配置也不变时，整个颜色配置才是不动的。因此，这样的情况下，fix(g) = fix_vertices(g) × fix_faces(g)。因此，我的计算是正确的。所以，最终的答案是36，即不同的涂色方法有36种，用boxed{36}表示。答案boxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;我们需要计算正四面体的每个面和每个顶点涂红色或蓝色的不同涂色方法数，考虑旋转对称性的影响。使用Burnside引理来解决这个问题。正四面体的旋转群有12个元素，分为三类：1. 恒等旋转（1个）2. 绕顶点到对面面中心轴的120度和240度旋转（8个）3. 绕对边中点轴的180度旋转（3个）应用Burnside引理：轨道数目 = (所有群元素不动点数目之和) / 群的大小计算各类群元素的不动点数目：1. 恒等旋转：   - 面颜色和顶点颜色均可任意选择，不动点数目为 (2^4 times 2^4 = 256)。2. 绕顶点到面中心轴的120度和240度旋转：   - 三个面被循环置换，另一个面保持不变。面颜色不动点数目为 (2 times 2 = 4)（三个面颜色相同，另一个面颜色任意）。   - 三个顶点被循环置换，另一个顶点保持不变。顶点颜色不动点数目为 (2 times 2 = 4)。   - 每个旋转的不动点数目为 (4 times 4 = 16)。8个旋转的总贡献为 (8 times 16 = 128)。3. 绕对边中点轴的180度旋转：   - 两对面被交换，两对顶点被交换。面颜色不动点数目为 (2 times 2 = 4)（每对面颜色相同）。   - 顶点颜色不动点数目为 (2 times 2 = 4)（每对顶点颜色相同）。   - 每个旋转的不动点数目为 (4 times 4 = 16)。3个旋转的总贡献为 (3 times 16 = 48)。总和计算：- 恒等旋转：256- 绕顶点到面中心轴的旋转：128- 绕对边中点轴的旋转：48总不动点数目和为 (256 + 128 + 48 = 432)。轨道数目：轨道数目 = (432 / 12 = 36)。最终答案：[boxed{36}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out how many different ways there are to color each face and each vertex of a regular tetrahedron either red or blue. The catch is that two colorings are considered the same if you can rotate one tetrahedron to look like the other. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving group theory and maybe Burnside&#39;s lemma? Let me recall... Burnside&#39;s lemma is useful for counting distinct colorings under group actions, right? The formula is the average number of colorings fixed by each group element.First, let me confirm the group of rotations of a regular tetrahedron. The tetrahedral group has 12 elements, I think. Let me check: for a regular tetrahedron, there are 4 faces. The rotation group is isomorphic to the alternating group A4, which has 12 elements. Yes, that&#39;s right. So the order of the group is 12.Now, the objects we&#39;re coloring are both the faces and the vertices. Each face can be red or blue, and each vertex can be red or blue. Since there are 4 faces and 4 vertices, each with 2 color choices, if there were no symmetries, the total number of colorings would be 2^4 (for faces) multiplied by 2^4 (for vertices), which is 2^8 = 256. But since rotations can make some colorings equivalent, we need to divide by the group action. But Burnside&#39;s lemma says we have to compute the average number of colorings fixed by each group element.So, I need to consider each type of rotation in the tetrahedral group, determine how many colorings are fixed by that rotation, and then average them.The tetrahedral group has different conjugacy classes. Let me recall the conjugacy classes for A4. The group A4 has:1. The identity element.2. 8 elements of order 3: these are the rotations by 120 degrees and 240 degrees around axes through a vertex and the center of the opposite face. Since there are 4 vertices, but each such rotation is in two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise), but in A4, these form two conjugacy classes? Wait, actually in A4, the 8 elements of order 3 split into two conjugacy classes each containing 4 elements? Wait, no. Wait, maybe in the rotation group of the tetrahedron, which is isomorphic to A4, the conjugacy classes are:- Identity: 1 element.- Rotations of 120 degrees and 240 degrees around axes through vertices: there are 8 such elements. Wait, no. Let me think again. A regular tetrahedron has 4 vertices. Each rotation axis goes through a vertex and the center of the opposite face. For each such axis, there are two non-trivial rotations: 120 degrees and 240 degrees. Since there are 4 axes, that gives 8 elements. However, in A4, the 8 elements of order 3 form a single conjugacy class? Or two?Wait, no. A4 has conjugacy classes: identity (1), 3-cycles (8 elements), double transpositions (3 elements). Wait, but 1 + 8 + 3 = 12, which matches the order of A4. But in terms of the tetrahedral group, how do these correspond? The 3-cycles correspond to the 120 and 240 degree rotations, and the double transpositions correspond to the 180-degree rotations. Wait, but a regular tetrahedron doesn&#39;t have 180-degree rotations? Wait, actually, no. Wait, maybe in the tetrahedral group, the elements are:- Identity: 1- Rotations by 120 degrees around an axis: 8 elements (since 4 axes, each with two directions)Wait, but A4 has only 8 elements of order 3 and 3 elements of order 2. So maybe the rotation axes through edges? Hmm, maybe the 180-degree rotations correspond to swapping two pairs of opposite edges. Let me see. If you rotate 180 degrees around an axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges, that swaps the two edges. There are 3 pairs of opposite edges in a tetrahedron, so 3 such rotations. So in total, conjugacy classes are:1. Identity (1 element)2. Rotations of 120 and 240 degrees (8 elements, split into two conjugacy classes? But in A4, these 8 elements form a single conjugacy class? Wait, according to A4&#39;s structure, the 3-cycles are a single conjugacy class of 8 elements. But in the tetrahedral group, rotating 120 degrees and 240 degrees around a vertex-face axis would correspond to different cycle structures. Wait, but maybe not. Let me check.Wait, maybe in the tetrahedral group, the 120 and 240 degree rotations about a vertex-face axis correspond to even permutations, which are the 3-cycles. Since A4 is the alternating group on 4 elements (the vertices), a rotation that cycles three vertices and fixes one would correspond to a 3-cycle. Similarly, a 240-degree rotation is the inverse, which is also a 3-cycle. So perhaps all the 120 and 240 degree rotations correspond to the 8 3-cycles in A4. Then the other conjugacy class is the three double transpositions, which correspond to the 180-degree rotations through edge midpoints.Therefore, the conjugacy classes are:1. Identity: 1 element.2. 8 elements of order 3 (rotations by 120 and 240 degrees around vertex-face axes).3. 3 elements of order 2 (rotations by 180 degrees around edge midpoints axes).Okay, that seems right.So, to apply Burnside&#39;s lemma, we need to compute, for each conjugacy class, the number of colorings fixed by elements of that class, multiplied by the size of the conjugacy class, sum them up, and divide by the group order (12).So, first, let&#39;s handle each conjugacy class:1. Identity element: fixes all colorings. So the number is 2^8 = 256.2. Elements of order 3 (rotations by 120 and 240 degrees). There are 8 elements here. Each such rotation cycles three faces and three vertices, while fixing one face and one vertex. Wait, is that true?Wait, consider a rotation around a vertex-face axis. Let&#39;s fix a vertex, say vertex A, and the opposite face (the face not containing A). A 120-degree rotation around this axis will cycle the three other vertices (B, C, D) and also cycle the three faces adjacent to A. Wait, each face is opposite a vertex. So the face opposite vertex A is fixed, and the three faces adjacent to A (which are opposite vertices B, C, D) are cycled. Similarly, the vertices: vertex A is fixed, and vertices B, C, D are cycled.So, a rotation by 120 degrees around the axis through vertex A and the center of face opposite A will cycle vertices B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; B and cycle the three faces adjacent to A (i.e., the faces opposite B, C, D). Similarly, the rotation by 240 degrees is the inverse cycle.So, such a rotation cycles three vertices and three faces, and fixes one vertex and one face.Therefore, for a coloring to be fixed by this rotation, the three cycled vertices must be the same color, and the three cycled faces must be the same color. The fixed vertex and face can be any color.Therefore, for each such rotation, the number of fixed colorings is:- For the vertices: the fixed vertex can be red or blue, and the three cycled vertices must all be the same color (either red or blue). So 2 * 2 = 4 choices.- For the faces: the fixed face can be red or blue, and the three cycled faces must all be the same color. Similarly, 2 * 2 = 4 choices.Therefore, total fixed colorings per such rotation is 4 * 4 = 16.Since there are 8 elements in this conjugacy class, total contribution is 8 * 16 = 128.3. Elements of order 2 (180-degree rotations). There are 3 such elements. Each rotation is around an axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges. Let me visualize this. Such a rotation swaps two pairs of vertices and swaps two pairs of faces.Wait, let&#39;s think about the effect on vertices. Suppose we have edges e1 and e2, which are opposite. A 180-degree rotation around the axis through their midpoints will swap the two vertices of e1 and swap the two vertices of e2. Wait, actually, no. Wait, each edge is connected to two vertices. If we rotate 180 degrees, each vertex is mapped to the other vertex of the same edge? Wait, perhaps. Let me try to consider specific edges.Suppose the tetrahedron has vertices A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s take two opposite edges, say AB and CD. The midpoint of AB and the midpoint of CD define an axis. Rotating 180 degrees around this axis swaps A with B and C with D.Similarly, the faces: each face is a triangle. The face ABC will be mapped to the face BAC, but since the rotation swaps A and B, and swaps C and D, the face ABC (which has vertices A, B, C) becomes face B, A, D. Wait, that&#39;s not a face of the tetrahedron. Wait, maybe the rotation affects the faces differently.Wait, the rotation swaps A and B, swaps C and D. Let&#39;s see which faces are fixed or swapped.Original faces:- Face ABC: after rotation, becomes BAC (but vertex C is now D?), no, wait. If you swap A &lt;-&gt; B and C &lt;-&gt; D, then face ABC becomes BAD. But BAD is another face of the tetrahedron? Let&#39;s check:Original faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.After swapping A &lt;-&gt; B and C &lt;-&gt; D:- Face ABC becomes BAD.- Face ABD becomes BAC.- Face ACD becomes BDC.- Face BCD becomes ACD.Wait, this seems messy. Maybe the faces are permuted in pairs.Wait, actually, perhaps each 180-degree rotation swaps two pairs of faces. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe each 180-degree rotation swaps two pairs of faces and swaps two pairs of vertices. So, for the vertices, A &lt;-&gt; B and C &lt;-&gt; D. For the faces, the face opposite A (which is BCD) and the face opposite B (which is ACD) are swapped. Similarly, the face opposite C (which is ABD) and the face opposite D (which is ABC) are swapped. Wait, not sure. Let me take a specific example.Suppose the rotation swaps vertices A &lt;-&gt; B and C &lt;-&gt; D.Then the face opposite A is BCD. After swapping A &lt;-&gt; B, the face opposite B is ACD. Similarly, the face opposite C is ABD, and after swapping C &lt;-&gt; D, the face opposite D is ABC. So, the face opposite A (BCD) becomes the face opposite B (ACD). The face opposite C (ABD) becomes the face opposite D (ABC). So, the rotation swaps the pairs (BCD, ACD) and (ABD, ABC). So each face is swapped with another face. Therefore, each 180-degree rotation swaps two pairs of faces and swaps two pairs of vertices.Therefore, for a coloring fixed by such a rotation, the swapped vertices must be the same color, and the swapped faces must be the same color. Let&#39;s break it down:Vertices: A and B must be the same color, and C and D must be the same color.Faces: The face opposite A (BCD) and the face opposite B (ACD) must be the same color. Similarly, the face opposite C (ABD) and the face opposite D (ABC) must be the same color.But wait, since the rotation swaps these faces, their colors must be equal. So:- Face BCD and ACD must be the same color.- Face ABD and ABC must be the same color.But also, the fixed vertex pairs: A and B must be the same color, C and D must be the same color.So, how many colorings are fixed by this rotation?For vertices:- A = B- C = DEach of these pairs can be red or blue, so 2 * 2 = 4 choices.For faces:- BCD = ACD- ABD = ABCEach of these pairs can be red or blue, so 2 * 2 = 4 choices.Therefore, total fixed colorings per 180-degree rotation is 4 * 4 = 16.Since there are 3 such elements, total contribution is 3 * 16 = 48.Now, applying Burnside&#39;s lemma:Total distinct colorings = (1 * 256 + 8 * 16 + 3 * 16) / 12Calculate numerator:256 + (8 * 16) = 256 + 128 = 384384 + (3 * 16) = 384 + 48 = 432Divide by 12: 432 / 12 = 36.Wait, so the answer is 36? Hmm. Let me check the calculations again.Wait, the fixed colorings for the identity: 256, correct.For the 8 order-3 elements: each fixes 16 colorings, 8 * 16 = 128.For the 3 order-2 elements: each fixes 16 colorings, 3 * 16 = 48.256 + 128 + 48 = 432. 432 / 12 = 36. Yes, that&#39;s correct.But wait, let me verify if my analysis of the fixed colorings under each rotation is correct.First, for the 120/240-degree rotations: since they fix one vertex and one face, and cycle the other three vertices and three faces. Therefore, the three cycled vertices must be the same color, and the three cycled faces must be the same color. So, for vertices: fixed vertex (2 choices) + cycled vertices (2 choices). Similarly for faces. So 2*2*2*2 = 16. That seems right.For the 180-degree rotations: swaps two pairs of vertices and two pairs of faces. So, swapped vertices must be equal, swapped faces must be equal. So, vertices: 2 choices for each pair, 2*2. Faces: 2 choices for each pair, 2*2. Total 16. That also seems right.So, Burnside&#39;s lemma gives 36. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings is 36.Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I had only colored the vertices, then using Burnside&#39;s lemma, the count would be (1*16 + 8*2 + 3*4)/12 = (16 + 16 +12)/12 = 44/12 = 11/3, which is not an integer. Wait, but that can&#39;t be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no, if you only color vertices, each vertex 2 colors, then fixed colorings under identity: 16. Under order-3 rotations: each fixes colorings where three cycled vertices are the same color, so 2*2 (fixed vertex and the three cycled). So 4. 8 elements, so 8*4=32. Under order-2 rotations: swaps two pairs of vertices, so each pair must be same color. So 2*2=4. 3 elements, 3*4=12. Total: 16 +32 +12=60. 60/12=5. So there are 5 distinct colorings for vertices. Similarly, for faces alone, also 5. So if we combine vertices and faces, it&#39;s 5*5=25? But according to our previous calculation, 36. Hmm, discrepancy. Wait, why?Ah, because the colorings of vertices and faces are not independent. The group actions on vertices and faces are related. Because a rotation that affects both vertices and faces. So we can&#39;t just multiply the counts for vertices and faces. Instead, we have to consider colorings of both together.Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the combined effect on both vertices and faces. Hence, the calculation we did earlier with 36 is correct.Alternatively, if we think of the colorings as ordered pairs (vertex coloring, face coloring), then the group acts on both sets, and the total number is the Burnside count for the combined set.Alternatively, maybe 36 is correct. Let me check an example.Suppose all vertices and all faces are red. That&#39;s one coloring. Similarly, all blue. That&#39;s another. Then colorings where all vertices are red and all faces are blue, and vice versa. So that&#39;s 2 more. Then, colorings with vertices all red and faces having some mix. Wait, but with symmetries, perhaps the counts add up.But 36 seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe 12? Wait, but the calculation is 256 + 128 + 48 = 432, 432/12 = 36. So 36 is the answer.Wait, but I need to confirm with another method. Alternatively, use the formula for the number of colorings under the action of a group: for each orbit, the size is 12 divided by the stabilizer. But maybe not.Alternatively, think of the tetrahedron&#39;s vertices and faces as separate entities, but related by duality. Wait, a tetrahedron is self-dual, so vertices correspond to faces. But in our problem, we color both vertices and faces, so maybe there&#39;s a symmetry there.But the key is that the group acts on both vertices and faces. So each group element corresponds to permutations of both vertices and faces. Therefore, when computing fixed colorings, we need to consider the combined permutation on both sets.But in our Burnside&#39;s lemma calculation, we considered that each rotation permutes both the vertices and the faces. So for each group element, the permutation on vertices and faces could partition the colorings into cycles, and the coloring must be constant on each cycle.For the identity, all colorings are fixed. For the 120/240 degree rotations, we have cycles: a fixed vertex, a 3-cycle of vertices; a fixed face, a 3-cycle of faces. Therefore, the colorings must assign the same color to the three cycled vertices and the same color to the three cycled faces. For the 180-degree rotations, we have two 2-cycles of vertices and two 2-cycles of faces. Therefore, each pair in the 2-cycles must be the same color.Therefore, our earlier calculation seems correct. Therefore, 36 should be the answer.But to cross-verify, let me check an example.Suppose we color all vertices and faces red. This is fixed by any rotation. Similarly, all blue. Then, if we color all vertices red and all faces blue, that&#39;s fixed by any rotation. Similarly, all vertices blue and faces red. So that&#39;s 4 colorings.Then, colorings where all vertices are red, and faces have two colors. But considering symmetries, the faces can be colored in different ways. Wait, but faces are being colored, and under rotation. So how many colorings for faces alone? As I mentioned earlier, if considering only faces, Burnside gives (1*16 + 8*4 + 3*8)/12 = (16 + 32 + 24)/12 = 72/12 = 6. Wait, earlier I thought it was 5, but no:Wait, faces only: each face can be colored red or blue. The group acts on the faces. So the Burnside calculation:- Identity: 16 fixed colorings.- 8 elements of order 3: each fixes colorings where the three cycled faces are the same color. So fixed face can be red or blue, cycled faces must be the same color. So 2*2=4 per element. 8*4=32.- 3 elements of order 2: each swaps two pairs of faces. So each pair must be the same color. 2*2=4 per element. 3*4=12.Total: 16 +32 +12 =60. 60/12=5. So 5 colorings for faces. Similarly for vertices: 5 colorings.Therefore, if we colored vertices and faces independently, it would be 5*5=25 colorings. But since in our problem, vertices and faces are colored together, and the group acts on both simultaneously, the count isn&#39;t necessarily the product. Indeed, the Burnside count gives 36, which is more than 25. That makes sense because some colorings that are distinct when considering vertices and faces together might have been equivalent if considered separately.So the answer is 36. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{36}.Final Answerboxed{36}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of distinct ways to color each face and vertex of a regular tetrahedron red or blue, considering rotational symmetry, we use Burnside&#39;s lemma. The tetrahedral group has 12 elements, which can be divided into three conjugacy classes: identity, 120/240-degree rotations, and 180-degree rotations.1. Identity element (1 element):   - Fixes all colorings.   - Number of fixed colorings: (2^8 = 256).2. 120/240-degree rotations (8 elements):   - Each rotation cycles three vertices and three faces, and fixes one vertex and one face.   - For fixed colorings, the three cycled vertices must be the same color, and the three cycled faces must be the same color.   - Number of fixed colorings per rotation: (2^2 times 2^2 = 16).   - Total contribution: (8 times 16 = 128).3. 180-degree rotations (3 elements):   - Each rotation swaps two pairs of vertices and two pairs of faces.   - For fixed colorings, each pair of swapped vertices and swapped faces must be the same color.   - Number of fixed colorings per rotation: (2^2 times 2^2 = 16).   - Total contribution: (3 times 16 = 48).Applying Burnside&#39;s lemma:[text{Total distinct colorings} = frac{1 cdot 256 + 8 cdot 16 + 3 cdot 16}{12} = frac{256 + 128 + 48}{12} = frac{432}{12} = 36]Thus, the number of different ways to color the tetrahedron is (boxed{36}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8995579a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>🔑:</span>16. Let x be the number of blue vertices and y be the number of blue faces in a coloring. If x=0, we have 5 different ways to color the faces, namely y=0,1,2,3,4. If x=1, there are 2 ways to color the face opposite to the blue vertex and the remaining three faces may have 0,1,2 or 3 blue faces. Thus there are 2 times 4=8 different ways in this case. If x=2, call the edge connecting the two blue vertices the &quot; main edge &quot; and the two faces common to this edge the &quot; main faces&quot;. There are 3 ways to color the main faces, namely, both red, both blue, and one red and one blue. In the former two cases there are 3 ways to color the remaining faces, while in the last case there are four because reversing the color of the two faces does matter. Hence there are 10 ways in this case. By symmetry, there are 8 ways corresponding to the case x=3 and 5 ways corresponding to x=4.

Hmm, let me visualize this parallelepiped. Since it&#39;s a parallelepiped, all opposite edges are equal and parallel. Let me recall the problem details:- Points X on A1D1 with A1X = 5. Since A1D1 is an edge, the total length of A1D1 should be the same as AD, right? But they haven&#39;t given the length of AD directly. Wait, they mentioned B1C1 = 14. In a parallelepiped, B1C1 is equal to BC, right? So BC = 14. Then BY = 3, so point Y is 3 units from B along BC. So YC would be 14 - 3 = 11.Wait, but how are these edges related? In a parallelepiped, edges are grouped into three sets of four parallel edges. So, edges AA1, BB1, CC1, DD1 are all parallel. Edges AB, A1B1, DC, D1C1 are another set, and edges AD, A1D1, BC, B1C1 are the third set. So yes, B1C1 is the same as BC, which is 14. Therefore, edge AD is also 14, since AD is parallel to BC. Wait, no, hold on. AD is parallel to BC in a parallelogram base, but in a general parallelepiped, the edges might not all be the same length. Wait, but in a parallelepiped, opposite edges are equal. So if BC is 14, then AD should also be 14. Similarly, A1D1 is another edge parallel to AD, so A1D1 should also be 14. Therefore, since A1X is 5 on A1D1, then XD1 = 14 - 5 = 9.Similarly, BY = 3 on BC, so Y is 3 units from B towards C.Now, the plane C1XY intersects the ray DA at point Z. Need to find DZ.I think coordinate geometry might help here. Let me assign coordinates to the parallelepiped. Let&#39;s choose a coordinate system where point D is at the origin. Then, since AD is 14, point A would be at (14, 0, 0). Wait, but the direction of DA is from D to A, so if D is at (0,0,0), then A would be at (14,0,0). Then, since it&#39;s a parallelepiped, the other edges can be vectors. Let me denote the edges as vectors:Let’s assume that the edges DA, DC, and DD1 are along the coordinate axes. Wait, but in a general parallelepiped, the edges might not be orthogonal. Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe the problem is assuming a rectangular prism, but the term parallelepiped usually allows for non-right angles. However, since the problem doesn&#39;t specify angles or other edge lengths, perhaps we can assume it&#39;s a rectangular prism (i.e., a box) for simplicity? But the problem might not require that assumption. Hmm.Wait, but in a general parallelepiped, the edges DA, DC, DD1 can be represented as vectors. Let me set up coordinates with D at the origin. Let’s let DA be along the x-axis, DC be along the y-axis, and DD1 along the z-axis. Then, in this coordinate system, the coordinates of the vertices would be:- D: (0, 0, 0)- A: (a, 0, 0)- C: (0, c, 0)- D1: (0, 0, d)- Then, B is at (a, c, 0) because it&#39;s the corner opposite D in the base.- A1 is (a, 0, d)- B1 is (a, c, d)- C1 is (0, c, d)But the problem states that B1C1 = 14. Let&#39;s see, B1 is (a, c, d) and C1 is (0, c, d). So the vector B1C1 is (-a, 0, 0), so its length is |a| = 14. Therefore, a = 14. So DA is along the x-axis with length 14. Therefore, the coordinates become:- D: (0, 0, 0)- A: (14, 0, 0)- B: (14, c, 0)- C: (0, c, 0)- D1: (0, 0, d)- A1: (14, 0, d)- B1: (14, c, d)- C1: (0, c, d)Now, point X is on A1D1. A1 is (14, 0, d) and D1 is (0, 0, d). So the edge A1D1 is from (14, 0, d) to (0, 0, d). Since A1X = 5, moving from A1 towards D1, the coordinates of X would be (14 - 5, 0, d) = (9, 0, d). Wait, if A1D1 is length 14, then A1X = 5 implies that X is 5 units from A1 along A1D1. Since A1D1 is along the x-axis from (14, 0, d) to (0, 0, d), decreasing x-coordinate. So the x-coordinate of X is 14 - 5 = 9, y and z remain 0 and d. So X is (9, 0, d).Similarly, point Y is on BC with BY = 3. BC goes from B (14, c, 0) to C (0, c, 0). The length BC is 14, as given. So BY = 3 implies moving from B towards C by 3 units. Since BC is along the x-axis from (14, c, 0) to (0, c, 0), decreasing x-coordinate. So Y&#39;s coordinates are (14 - 3, c, 0) = (11, c, 0).Now, we need to find the equation of the plane C1XY. Let&#39;s get coordinates of C1, X, Y.C1 is (0, c, d).X is (9, 0, d).Y is (11, c, 0).So three points: C1(0, c, d), X(9, 0, d), Y(11, c, 0).We can find the equation of the plane using these three points. Let&#39;s compute two vectors in the plane:Vector C1X = X - C1 = (9 - 0, 0 - c, d - d) = (9, -c, 0).Vector C1Y = Y - C1 = (11 - 0, c - c, 0 - d) = (11, 0, -d).Then the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of C1X and C1Y.Compute cross product:i | j | k9 | -c | 011 | 0 | -dSo determinant:i * [(-c)(-d) - 0*0] - j * [9*(-d) - 0*11] + k * [9*0 - (-c)*11]= i * (cd) - j * (-9d) + k * (11c)So normal vector N = (cd, 9d, 11c)Therefore, the equation of the plane is:cd(x - 0) + 9d(y - c) + 11c(z - d) = 0Simplify:cd x + 9d y - 9d c + 11c z - 11c d = 0Combine like terms:cd x + 9d y + 11c z - 9dc - 11cd = 0cd x + 9d y + 11c z - 20cd = 0Divide through by d (assuming d ≠ 0):c x + 9 y + 11 (c/d) z - 20c = 0Wait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps leave it as:cd x + 9d y + 11c z = 20cdNow, we need to find where this plane intersects the ray DA. Ray DA starts at D (0,0,0) and goes towards A (14,0,0). So parametric equations for DA: x = 14t, y = 0, z = 0, where t ≥ 0.But wait, the problem says the ray DA, which is from D to A. Wait, but in our coordinate system, DA is from D(0,0,0) to A(14,0,0). So any point on DA can be written as (14t, 0, 0) where t ≥ 0. However, since the plane might intersect DA at a point beyond A (if t &gt; 1), but the problem says &quot;intersects the ray DA at point Z&quot;. So Z could be on DA extended beyond A, but we have to check.But let&#39;s plug the parametric coordinates into the plane equation.Plane equation: cd x + 9d y + 11c z = 20cdSubstitute x =14t, y=0, z=0:cd*(14t) + 9d*0 + 11c*0 = 20cd14cd t = 20cdAssuming cd ≠ 0, divide both sides by cd:14t = 20 =&gt; t = 20/14 = 10/7 ≈ 1.42857So the point Z is at (14*(10/7), 0, 0) = (20, 0, 0). Wait, but D is at (0,0,0) and A is at (14,0,0). So point Z is at (20,0,0), which is 20 units from D along the DA direction. Therefore, DZ = 20.Wait, but hold on. The answer seems straightforward, but let me check if the calculation is correct.First, coordinates assigned:- C1 is (0, c, d)- X is (9, 0, d)- Y is (11, c, 0)Vectors C1X = (9, -c, 0)C1Y = (11, 0, -d)Cross product N = (cd, 9d, 11c)Plane equation: cd x +9d y +11c z = 20cdParametrize DA as (14t,0,0). Plug into plane equation:cd*(14t) +0 +0 =20cd =&gt;14t=20 =&gt;t=10/7. So x=14*(10/7)=20. So Z=(20,0,0). Thus DZ is the distance from D (0,0,0) to Z (20,0,0), which is 20.But in the problem, edges are given as B1C1=14, which in our coordinate system is indeed 14. Also, A1D1 is 14, so A1X=5, which places X at (9,0,d). BY=3 on BC (length 14), so Y is at (11,c,0). The plane passes through these three points. Then intersection with DA is found by parametrizing DA and solving. The variables c and d canceled out in the equation, which is why the result is independent of c and d. So DZ is 20.But wait, the problem didn&#39;t specify the height of the parallelepiped (i.e., the length of DD1), but in our calculation, the variables c and d canceled out, so regardless of the values of c and d (as long as they are non-zero), DZ is 20. That seems correct?Let me check with an example. Suppose the parallelepiped is a cube, so c=14 (since BC=14) and d=14. Then points:C1 would be (0,14,14)X is (9,0,14)Y is (11,14,0)Compute the plane equation. Using the cross product:N = (cd, 9d, 11c) = (14*14, 9*14, 11*14) = (196, 126, 154)Plane equation: 196x +126y +154z = 20*14*14 = 20*196 = 3920Parametrize DA: (14t,0,0). Substitute into plane equation:196*(14t) +0 +0 = 3920196*14t = 39202744t = 3920t = 3920 / 2744 = (3920 ÷ 56)/(2744 ÷56) = 70 / 49 = 10/7So same result. Then Z is at (14*(10/7),0,0)=20. So DZ=20. So even in the cube case, it&#39;s 20. Therefore, the answer is 20.But the problem didn&#39;t specify that it&#39;s a cube, just a parallelepiped, but since the result is independent of c and d, it&#39;s general. Therefore, DZ=20.Final Answerboxed{20}&lt;/think&gt;Given a parallelepiped (ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1) with points (X) on (A_1D_1) and (Y) on (BC). We know (A_1X = 5), (BY = 3), and (B_1C_1 = 14). We need to find the length (DZ) where the plane (C_1XY) intersects the ray (DA).1. Coordinates Assignment:   - Set (D) at the origin ((0, 0, 0)).   - (A) is at ((14, 0, 0)) since (AD = 14) (as (B_1C_1 = 14) and opposite edges are equal).   - (C_1) is at ((0, c, d)), (X) is at ((9, 0, d)) (since (A_1X = 5)), and (Y) is at ((11, c, 0)) (since (BY = 3)).2. Vectors in the Plane:   - Vector (C_1X = (9, -c, 0))   - Vector (C_1Y = (11, 0, -d))3. Normal Vector Calculation:   - Cross product (C_1X times C_1Y = (cd, 9d, 11c))4. Plane Equation:   - Using point (C_1(0, c, d)): (cd(x - 0) + 9d(y - c) + 11c(z - d) = 0)   - Simplifies to: (cd x + 9d y + 11c z = 20cd)5. Intersection with Ray (DA):   - Parametric form of (DA): (x = 14t), (y = 0), (z = 0)   - Substitute into plane equation: (cd(14t) = 20cd)   - Solve for (t): (14t = 20 Rightarrow t = frac{10}{7})   - Point (Z) is at ((14 times frac{10}{7}, 0, 0) = (20, 0, 0))6. Length (DZ):   - Distance from (D(0, 0, 0)) to (Z(20, 0, 0)) is (20).Thus, the length (DZ) is (boxed{20}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. Hmm, it&#39;s about a parallelepiped, which I remember is a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. The points mentioned are labeled A, B, C, D, A1, B1, C1, D1. So, probably, the base is ABCD and the top face is A1B1C1D1, with edges connecting corresponding vertices.The problem states that a point X is chosen on edge A1D1 such that A1X = 5. Then, a point Y is on edge BC with BY = 3. They also mention that B1C1 = 14. The plane formed by points C1, X, and Y intersects the ray DA at point Z. We need to find DZ.First, let me visualize the parallelepiped. Since it&#39;s a parallelepiped, all opposite edges are equal and parallel. So, edges like AA1, BB1, CC1, DD1 are all equal in length and parallel. The faces are all parallelograms.Given that B1C1 = 14, which is an edge on the top face. Since it&#39;s a parallelogram, BC (on the base) should also be 14, right? Because opposite edges in a parallelogram are equal. So BC = B1C1 = 14.Point Y is on BC with BY = 3. Since BC is 14, then YC = BC - BY = 14 - 3 = 11. So Y divides BC into segments of 3 and 11.Point X is on A1D1 with A1X = 5. The edge A1D1 is part of the top face. The length of A1D1 should be equal to AD, since it&#39;s a parallelepiped. But we aren&#39;t given the length of AD. Hmm, maybe we don&#39;t need it directly? Or maybe we can assign coordinates to the points to make this easier.Coordinates might be a good approach here. Let&#39;s assign a coordinate system. Let me set point A as the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, since it&#39;s a parallelepiped, we can define vectors for the edges.Let’s denote the vectors:- Vector AB as along the x-axis: let’s say AB has length a, so point B is at (a, 0, 0).- Vector AD is along the y-axis: since AD is another edge, let’s say AD has length b, so point D is at (0, b, 0).- Vector AA1 is along the z-axis: since AA1 is the vertical edge, let’s say AA1 has length c, so point A1 is at (0, 0, c).But wait, in a general parallelepiped, the edges don&#39;t have to be orthogonal. Hmm, but if we use a coordinate system where the edges are not necessarily orthogonal, it might complicate things. Maybe using a rectangular prism (a special case of a parallelepiped where all angles are right angles) would simplify the problem? But the problem doesn&#39;t specify it&#39;s a rectangular prism, just a parallelepiped. So maybe we need a more general approach.Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors and parametric equations for the lines and planes. Since the problem involves intersections of planes and lines, coordinates might still be the way to go, even if it&#39;s a general parallelepiped.Wait, but in that case, the coordinates would need to account for the non-right angles. Alternatively, perhaps we can use affine coordinates or barycentric coordinates. Hmm, this might get complex.Alternatively, perhaps we can assign coordinates such that A is the origin, and vectors AB, AD, and AA1 are the basis vectors. Then, any point in the parallelepiped can be expressed as linear combinations of these vectors. Since the problem involves ratios along edges, maybe using parametric coordinates would help.Let’s try this approach.Let’s assign coordinates with point A at (0, 0, 0).Let’s define the vectors:- AB as vector u,- AD as vector v,- AA1 as vector w.Then, all points can be expressed in terms of u, v, w. For example:- Point B is at u,- Point D is at v,- Point A1 is at w,- Point C is at u + v,- Point C1 is at u + v + w,Wait, actually, in a parallelepiped, the points are constructed by adding the vectors. So starting from A (origin), moving along u to B, along v to D, along w to A1. Then, point C is B + D - A = u + v, and similarly, C1 is C + AA1 = u + v + w.But in this case, edges like A1D1 would be from A1 to D1, which is D1 = D + AA1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.In a parallelepiped, the top face A1B1C1D1 is a translation of the base face ABCD by the vector AA1. So, each vertex on the top face is the corresponding base vertex plus the vector w (AA1). Therefore:- A1 = A + w = w- B1 = B + w = u + w- C1 = C + w = u + v + w- D1 = D + w = v + wTherefore, edge A1D1 is from A1 (w) to D1 (v + w). So the vector along A1D1 is v.Similarly, edge BC is from B (u) to C (u + v), so the vector along BC is v.Given that, point X is on A1D1 such that A1X = 5. Since A1D1 is the edge from A1 to D1, which is vector v. So the length of A1D1 is |v|. But we aren&#39;t given the actual length, only that A1X = 5. So perhaps this is a ratio? Wait, but the problem states A1X = 5, so it&#39;s a length. Hmm. Similarly, BY = 3, and B1C1 = 14. Wait, B1C1 is the edge from B1 to C1, which is v, so |v| = 14. Because B1C1 is the same as BC, right? Since it&#39;s a parallelogram. Wait, BC is part of the base, and B1C1 is part of the top face. Since the figure is a parallelepiped, opposite edges are equal and parallel. Therefore, BC and B1C1 are both equal in length and parallel.But the problem states that B1C1 = 14, so BC = 14 as well. Therefore, the length of vector v (since BC is from B to C, which is vector v) is 14. So |v| = 14.Therefore, edge A1D1 is also length 14, since it&#39;s the same vector v. Therefore, A1X = 5 means that the segment from A1 to X is 5 units long. So since the total length of A1D1 is 14, then X divides A1D1 in the ratio 5:9 (since 5 + 9 = 14). So the ratio A1X : XD1 = 5 : 9.Similarly, point Y is on BC with BY = 3. Since BC is 14, then BY : YC = 3 : 11.So now, to find the plane C1XY and its intersection with ray DA at point Z, and then find DZ.To approach this, maybe setting up coordinates with vectors is the way to go. Let&#39;s try that.Let’s define coordinate system with point A at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then:- Vector AB = u = (a, 0, 0)- Vector AD = v = (0, b, 0)- Vector AA1 = w = (0, 0, c)Wait, but in a general parallelepiped, the vectors u, v, w can be non-orthogonal. But if we use a coordinate system where the edges are orthogonal, then it&#39;s a rectangular prism, which is a special case. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify that the parallelepiped is rectangular, so we can&#39;t assume that. Hmm, this complicates things.Alternatively, maybe we can use affine coordinates where the axes are along AB, AD, and AA1, even if they are not orthogonal. Let&#39;s attempt that.Let’s denote:- The coordinates of a point P in the parallelepiped can be expressed as (x, y, z), where x is the coefficient for vector AB, y is the coefficient for vector AD, and z is the coefficient for vector AA1.But in this case, the coordinates would be affine combinations. For example:- Point A is (0, 0, 0)- Point B is (1, 0, 0)- Point D is (0, 1, 0)- Point A1 is (0, 0, 1)- Then, point C would be B + D - A = (1, 1, 0)- Point C1 is C + AA1 = (1, 1, 1)Wait, but in reality, the edges AB, AD, AA1 may not be unit vectors. So perhaps scaling is necessary. Hmm.Alternatively, since we know the length of B1C1 is 14, which is the same as BC. So BC is vector v (from B to C is AD), so |v| = 14. Therefore, the length of vector AD is 14. So in this coordinate system, vector v has magnitude 14.But we need to relate the lengths of A1X and BY. Since A1X = 5, and A1D1 is length 14 (same as AD), then X is 5/14 along A1D1.Similarly, BY = 3, BC = 14, so Y is 3/14 along BC.But maybe using parametric coordinates for points X and Y.Let&#39;s proceed.First, let&#39;s assign coordinates:Let’s let:- A = (0, 0, 0)- B = (u, 0, 0) for some u (length AB)- D = (0, v, 0) for some v (length AD). Given BC = 14, and BC is equal to AD, so v = 14.- A1 = (0, 0, w) for some w (length AA1)Therefore:- C = B + D - A = (u, 14, 0)- D1 = D + A1 = (0, 14, w)- C1 = C + A1 = (u, 14, w)- B1 = B + A1 = (u, 0, w)- A1 is (0, 0, w)- D1 is (0, 14, w)Now, point X is on A1D1 such that A1X = 5. Since A1D1 is from (0, 0, w) to (0, 14, w). So this is a vertical edge along the y-axis at x=0, z=w. The distance from A1 to X is 5, so since the total length of A1D1 is 14 (same as AD), then the coordinate of X is (0, 5, w). Wait, but if we move along A1D1, which is in the y-direction, then starting from A1 (0,0,w), moving 5 units along y would reach (0,5,w). But in reality, in 3D space, the distance from A1 to X is 5. However, if the edge A1D1 is aligned along the y-axis (in our coordinate system), then the length along the edge would correspond directly to the y-coordinate. But we have to confirm if that&#39;s the case.Wait, in our coordinate system, vector AD is along the y-axis with length 14, so edge AD is from (0,0,0) to (0,14,0), so yes, length 14. Then edge A1D1 is from (0,0,w) to (0,14,w), which is also length 14. Therefore, moving 5 units along A1D1 from A1 would indeed be the point (0,5,w). So X is at (0,5,w).Similarly, point Y is on BC with BY = 3. Edge BC is from B (u,0,0) to C (u,14,0). So moving 3 units from B along BC. Since BC is length 14, moving 3 units along it would be a fraction of 3/14. So the coordinates of Y can be parametrized as B + (3/14)*(C - B) = (u,0,0) + (3/14)*(0,14,0) = (u, 3, 0). Therefore, Y is at (u,3,0).Now, the plane is defined by points C1, X, and Y. Let&#39;s find the equation of this plane.First, let&#39;s write the coordinates of C1, X, and Y:- C1: (u,14,w)- X: (0,5,w)- Y: (u,3,0)We need to find the equation of the plane passing through these three points.To find the equation of a plane, we can use the general form ax + by + cz + d = 0. Plugging in the coordinates of the three points will give us a system of equations to solve for a, b, c, d.Alternatively, we can find two vectors lying on the plane and compute the normal vector.Let&#39;s compute two vectors in the plane:Vector C1X = X - C1 = (0 - u, 5 - 14, w - w) = (-u, -9, 0)Vector C1Y = Y - C1 = (u - u, 3 - 14, 0 - w) = (0, -11, -w)Then, the normal vector n to the plane is the cross product of C1X and C1Y.Compute cross product:n = C1X × C1Y = |i   j   k|                  |-u -9   0|                  |0 -11 -w|= i [(-9)(-w) - (0)(-11)] - j [(-u)(-w) - (0)(0)] + k [(-u)(-11) - (-9)(0)]= i [9w] - j [uw] + k [11u]Therefore, the normal vector is (9w, -uw, 11u)So the equation of the plane can be written as:9w(x - u) - uw(y - 14) + 11u(z - w) = 0Wait, actually, the plane equation can be written using the normal vector components as:9w(x) - uw(y) + 11u(z) + d = 0To find d, substitute point C1 (u,14,w):9w(u) - uw(14) + 11u(w) + d = 0Compute:9wu - 14uw + 11uw + d = 0Combine like terms:(9wu -14uw +11uw) + d = 0( (9 -14 +11)wu ) + d = 0(6wu) + d = 0Therefore, d = -6wuSo the plane equation is:9w x - uw y + 11u z -6wu = 0We can factor out u from the terms that have it:9w x - u(w y - 11 z + 6w) = 0But maybe we can divide the entire equation by u (assuming u ≠ 0, which it is since AB is an edge):(9w/u) x - w y + 11 z -6w = 0Not sure if that helps. Maybe leave it as is.Now, we need to find where this plane intersects the ray DA. Ray DA starts at D and goes towards A. Let&#39;s find the parametric equation of ray DA.Point D is at (0,14,0). Point A is at (0,0,0). So the ray DA goes from D (0,14,0) to A (0,0,0) and beyond. But since it&#39;s a ray starting at D and going towards A, the parametric equation can be written as:x = 0y = 14 -14tz = 0where t ≥ 0. When t = 0, we are at D (0,14,0); when t = 1, we reach A (0,0,0); for t &gt;1, we go beyond A.But the problem says the plane intersects the ray DA at point Z. So we need to find t such that the point (0,14 -14t,0) lies on the plane.Let&#39;s substitute x=0, y=14 -14t, z=0 into the plane equation:9w(0) - uw(14 -14t) +11u(0) -6wu = 0Simplify:0 - uw(14 -14t) +0 -6wu =0Factor out uw:-uw[14 -14t +6] =0Wait, let&#39;s check the calculation step by step.Original equation after substitution:9w*0 - uw*(14 -14t) +11u*0 -6wu = 0Which is:0 - uw*(14 -14t) +0 -6wu =0Factor terms:- uw*(14 -14t) -6wu =0Factor out -uw:-uw [ (14 -14t) +6 ] =0So,-uw [14 -14t +6] =0Simplify inside the brackets:14 +6 -14t =20 -14tTherefore,-uw(20 -14t)=0Assuming u ≠0 and w ≠0 (since they are edges of the parallelepiped), then:20 -14t =0Solve for t:14t=20 =&gt; t=20/14=10/7≈1.42857But t=10/7&gt;1, which is beyond point A on the ray DA. Wait, but the problem states that the plane intersects the ray DA at point Z. So if t=10/7, then the coordinates of Z are:x=0y=14 -14*(10/7)=14 -20= -6z=0But point Z is supposed to lie on the ray DA, which starts at D and goes through A. However, when t=10/7, the point is (0,-6,0), which is beyond A in the direction opposite to D. But the problem says &quot;intersects the ray DA&quot;. If the ray is defined as starting at D and going through A indefinitely, then yes, Z is on that ray beyond A. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s written as &quot;the ray DA&quot;. Typically, a ray starts at a point and goes infinitely in one direction. So DA would start at D and go through A, extending beyond. So point Z is on that extended ray beyond A.But then, the problem asks for DZ. Let&#39;s compute the distance from D to Z. Since D is at (0,14,0) and Z is at (0,-6,0). The distance is |14 - (-6)| along the y-axis, so 20 units. Wait, but let&#39;s verify.Wait, coordinates:D is (0,14,0)Z is (0,-6,0)So the distance DZ is sqrt[(0-0)^2 + (-6 -14)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-20)^2 +0] = sqrt[400] =20.But the answer is supposed to be a numerical value. However, we were given B1C1=14, which we used as the length of vector v (AD), which is 14. The problem doesn&#39;t give any other lengths. So unless there is a miscalculation here, the answer would be 20. But wait, let&#39;s check the steps again.Wait, in the plane equation:After substituting point Z (which is on DA ray) into the plane equation, we obtained t=10/7, which gives Z at (0, -6,0). Then DZ is the distance from D (0,14,0) to Z (0,-6,0), which is 14 - (-6) =20. So DZ=20.But the problem might expect the answer as 20. However, the problem is in a parallelepiped where edges might not be orthogonal. Wait, but in our coordinate system, we assumed AD is along the y-axis, which is orthogonal to AB and AA1. But in reality, a general parallelepiped can have non-orthogonal edges. However, in our coordinate system, we considered vectors AB, AD, AA1 as orthogonal. But is that valid?Wait, perhaps not. Because in a general parallelepiped, the edges are not necessarily orthogonal. So by assigning coordinates with AB, AD, AA1 as orthogonal axes, we might have converted the parallelepiped into a rectangular prism, which is a special case. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify that it&#39;s a rectangular prism, so perhaps this approach is invalid.Hmm, this is a critical point. If the parallelepiped is not orthogonal, then our coordinate system assumption might lead to an incorrect result. So we need a different approach that doesn&#39;t assume orthogonality.Alternatively, maybe the answer is indeed 20, regardless of the other edges, because of the ratios involved. Let&#39;s think.Wait, in our calculation, we found that DZ =20. Let&#39;s check the steps again without assuming orthogonality.Alternatively, perhaps using mass point geometry or similar triangles.Alternatively, consider parametric equations in vector form.Let’s define the vectors:Let’s denote the origin at point A. Let’s define vectors:- AB = u- AD = v (with |v| =14)- AA1 = wTherefore, coordinates:- A: 0- B: u- D: v- A1: w- C: u + v- C1: u + v + w- D1: v + wPoint X is on A1D1, which is from w to v + w. So the parametric equation for A1D1 is w + t(v) where t ∈ [0,1]. Given that A1X =5, and |v|=14, then t=5/14. Therefore, X= w + (5/14)v.Point Y is on BC, which is from u to u + v. BY=3, so since BC length is 14, Y divides BC in the ratio 3:11. Therefore, Y= u + (3/14)v.Now, the plane C1XY can be described parametrically. Let&#39;s find the equation of this plane.Points:- C1: u + v + w- X: w + (5/14)v- Y: u + (3/14)vWe can express vectors in the plane:Vector C1X = X - C1 = [w + (5/14)v] - [u + v + w] = -u - (9/14)vVector C1Y = Y - C1 = [u + (3/14)v] - [u + v + w] = - (11/14)v - wNow, the plane can be parametrized as C1 + s(C1X) + t(C1Y), where s and t are real numbers.So, any point on the plane is:u + v + w + s(-u - (9/14)v) + t(- (11/14)v - w)We need to find where this plane intersects the ray DA. The ray DA starts at D (v) and goes in the direction towards A (origin). So parametric equation for ray DA is:v - kv = (1 - k)v, where k ≥0.So when k=0, we are at D (v), and as k increases, we move towards A (k=1 gives A at 0).Wait, but if we parameterize DA as starting at D and going towards A, the parametric equation would be D + t(A - D) = v + t(-v) = (1 - t)v, where t ≥0.So points on DA are (1 - t)v for t ≥0.We need to find t such that (1 - t)v lies on the plane C1XY.So set (1 - t)v equal to the plane parametrization:(1 - t)v = u + v + w + s(-u - (9/14)v) + t(- (11/14)v - w)Wait, but this might be confusing because t is used both as the parameter for DA and in the plane equation. Let me adjust the notation.Let’s use different parameters. Let’s denote the plane parametrization as:u + v + w + s(-u - (9/14)v) + r(- (11/14)v - w)And the ray DA as:(1 - k)v, where k ≥0.So set them equal:(1 - k)v = u + v + w - su - (9/14)sv - (11/14)rv - rwSimplify the right-hand side:= u - su + v + w - rw - (9/14)sv - (11/14)rvGroup like terms:= (1 - s)u + [1 - (9/14)s - (11/14)r]v + (1 - r)wSet equal to left-hand side:(1 - k)v = (1 - s)u + [1 - (9/14)s - (11/14)r]v + (1 - r)wNow, since u, v, w are linearly independent (they form the edges of a parallelepiped, which is 3-dimensional), their coefficients must be equal on both sides.Therefore, we have the following equations:For u:0 = (1 - s) =&gt; 1 - s =0 =&gt; s=1For v:(1 - k) = [1 - (9/14)s - (11/14)r]For w:0 = (1 - r) =&gt; 1 - r =0 =&gt; r=1Now, substitute s=1 and r=1 into the v component equation:1 - k = 1 - (9/14)(1) - (11/14)(1)Simplify:1 - k =1 - (9/14 +11/14) =1 - (20/14)=1 -10/7= (7/7 -10/7)= -3/7Therefore,1 -k = -3/7 =&gt; k=1 +3/7=10/7Therefore, k=10/7, which is the parameter for the ray DA. Therefore, the point Z is:(1 -k)v = (1 -10/7)v= (-3/7)vBut v is the vector AD, which has length 14. So the point Z is located at (-3/7)v from the origin A, which is in the direction opposite to D, 3/7 of the length of AD. Therefore, the distance from D to Z is the distance from v to (-3/7)v, which is |v - (-3/7)v| = |(1 +3/7)v| = (10/7)|v| = (10/7)*14=20.Therefore, DZ=20.So regardless of the other edges, as long as |v|=14, DZ=20. Therefore, the answer is 20.This matches our previous calculation using the coordinate system with orthogonal edges. So even if the parallelepiped isn&#39;t orthogonal, the ratio along v gives us DZ=20.Therefore, the answer is boxed{20}.Final Answerboxed{20}&lt;/think&gt;Given a parallelepiped (ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1), we know that (A_1X = 5) on edge (A_1D_1), (BY = 3) on edge (BC), and (B_1C_1 = 14).

This continues up to the 1+2+...+2009th person. I need to find how many people end up getting at least one candy.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have 2010 people around a circular table. Person x gets the first candy. Then, starting from x, we move 1 person clockwise and give that person a candy. Then, from the last person who got a candy, we move 2 more people clockwise and give the next candy. Wait, no, hold on. The problem says: &quot;give candies to 1st person, 1+2th person, 1+2+3th person, ..., 1+2+...+2009th person clockwise from x.&quot; So maybe each time, the positions are counted from x? Let me parse that again.It says: &quot;Next, we give candies to 1st person, 1+2th person, 1+2+3th person, ..., and 1+2+...+2009th person clockwise from x.&quot; So starting from x, the first candy is given to the 1st person clockwise from x. Then the next candy is given to the (1+2)th person clockwise from x, which is the 3rd person. Then the (1+2+3)th person, which is the 6th person from x, and so on, up to the (1+2+...+2009)th person from x. So all these positions are relative to the original person x. So each time, it&#39;s a cumulative sum of integers from 1 to k, where k goes up to 2009, and each cumulative sum gives the position (modulo 2010, since it&#39;s a circular table) where a candy is given. So the number of candies given is 2009, since we start with x, then give 2009 more candies? Wait, original statement says &quot;we give one person x a candy. Next, we give candies to 1st person, ..., up to 1+2+...+2009th person.&quot; So total candies are 1 (for x) + 2009 (from the sequence) = 2010? But maybe some people get multiple candies. The problem asks for the number of people who get at least one candy, not the total number of candies.So, essentially, starting at x, we mark positions x, then x + 1, x + 1+2, x + 1+2+3, ..., x + 1+2+...+2009, modulo 2010. The question is how many unique positions these are.Alternatively, since the table is circular, we can fix x as position 0, and then the problem reduces to finding the number of unique positions among the cumulative sums S_k = 1 + 2 + ... + k mod 2010, for k from 1 to 2009, plus the initial person x (which is 0 in this coordinate system). But wait, actually, when we fix x as 0, the first candy is at 0. Then the next candies are at S_1 = 1, S_2 = 1+2 = 3, S_3 = 1+2+3 = 6, ..., S_{2009} = 1+2+...+2009. So we need to consider all these S_k for k from 1 to 2009, plus the initial 0, and count how many unique numbers there are modulo 2010.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the size of the set {0} ∪ {S_1, S_2, ..., S_{2009}} modulo 2010, where S_k = k(k+1)/2. Because 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Therefore, each position is given by S_k mod 2010. So the set of positions is {0} ∪ {k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 | 1 ≤ k ≤ 2009}. The question is how many distinct residues are in this set.So, to rephrase, we need to compute the number of distinct values in the sequence S_k = k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 for k from 1 to 2009, plus the initial 0, and then find the total number of unique residues.First, note that 2010 factors into primes as 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. So mod 2, mod 3, mod 5, mod 67. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of distinct residues modulo 2010 is equal to the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each of its prime power factors, provided that we handle each modulus appropriately. Wait, but since 2010 is square-free (all prime factors are to the first power), then CRT applies directly. So if we can find the number of distinct residues modulo 2, 3, 5, and 67, then multiply them together, that would give the total number of residues modulo 2010.But perhaps this approach is not straightforward here. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps we can analyze the mapping k → k(k+1)/2 mod 2010. The question is, for k from 1 to 2009, how many distinct values does this take? Then add 1 if 0 is not already included (but 0 is included as the initial position).Wait, but S_k = k(k+1)/2. So when k = 2010, S_{2010} = 2010*2011/2 = 2010*2011/2. But since 2010 is even, 2010/2 = 1005, so S_{2010} = 1005*2011. But 2011 is congruent to 1 mod 2010, so S_{2010} ≡ 1005*1 = 1005 mod 2010. So S_{2010} ≡ 1005 mod 2010. However, our k goes up to 2009, so S_{2009} = 2009*2010/2 = 2009*1005. Since 1005 is congruent to 1005 mod 2010, then 2009*1005 mod 2010. But 2009 ≡ -1 mod 2010, so S_{2009} ≡ (-1)*1005 ≡ -1005 ≡ 1005 mod 2010. Therefore, S_{2009} ≡ 1005 mod 2010. Therefore, S_{2010} ≡ 1005 mod 2010, so S_{2009} is congruent to 1005 mod 2010. So in our case, the last term S_{2009} is 1005 mod 2010.But how does this help?Wait, maybe first, let&#39;s consider that the function f(k) = k(k+1)/2 mod 2010. We need to find the number of distinct values of f(k) for k from 1 to 2009. Then add 1 for the initial 0, unless 0 is already covered by some f(k). So first, check if 0 is in the set {f(k)}.If 0 ≡ k(k+1)/2 mod 2010, then k(k+1)/2 ≡ 0 mod 2010. So 2010 divides k(k+1)/2. Since k and k+1 are coprime, one of them is even, so k(k+1)/2 is an integer. So 2010 divides k(k+1)/2. So 2010*2 divides k(k+1). So 2*2010 divides k(k+1). But 2*2010 = 4020. So k(k+1) ≡ 0 mod 4020. Since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, one of them must be divisible by 4, since 4020 = 4*3*5*67. Wait, 4020 factors as 4*3*5*67. Wait, 4020 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 67. So in order for k(k+1) to be divisible by 4, one of k or k+1 must be divisible by 4. Then, the other factor must be divisible by 3*5*67 = 1005. Therefore, either k ≡ 0 mod 4 and k+1 ≡ 0 mod 1005, or k+1 ≡ 0 mod 4 and k ≡ 0 mod 1005. Wait, but 1005 is odd, so k and k+1 can&#39;t both be even. Let&#39;s see:If k ≡ 0 mod 4, then k = 4m. Then k + 1 = 4m + 1 must be congruent to 0 mod 1005. So 4m + 1 ≡ 0 mod 1005 ⇒ 4m ≡ -1 mod 1005 ⇒ m ≡ (-1)/4 mod 1005. Since 4 and 1005 are coprime (1005 is 5*201, and 4 and 5 are coprime, 4 and 201 are coprime). So inverse of 4 mod 1005 exists. Let&#39;s compute 4^{-1} mod 1005. 4*251 = 1004 ≡ -1 mod 1005 ⇒ 4*(-251) ≡ 1 mod 1005 ⇒ 4^{-1} ≡ -251 ≡ 754 mod 1005. Therefore, m ≡ (-1)*754 ≡ -754 ≡ 251 mod 1005. Therefore, m = 1005n + 251. Therefore, k = 4m = 4*(1005n + 251) = 4020n + 1004. Therefore, k ≡ 1004 mod 4020. Since our k is up to 2009, which is less than 4020, the only possible k in this case is k = 1004. Let&#39;s check: k=1004. Then k+1=1005. k=1004 is divisible by 4 (1004/4=251). k+1=1005 is divisible by 1005. So k=1004 is a solution.Similarly, if k+1 ≡ 0 mod 4, then k = 4m -1. Then k ≡ 0 mod 1005. Therefore, 4m -1 ≡ 0 mod 1005 ⇒ 4m ≡ 1 mod 1005 ⇒ m ≡ 1/4 mod 1005. Again, using the inverse 754, m ≡ 754 mod 1005. Therefore, m = 1005n + 754, so k = 4*(1005n + 754) -1 = 4020n + 3016 -1 = 4020n + 3015. Therefore, k ≡ 3015 mod 4020. Since k ≤ 2009, the only possible k here is k=3015, but 3015 &gt;2009, so no solution in this case. Therefore, the only solution for k(k+1)/2 ≡0 mod2010 is k=1004. So S_{1004}=1004*1005/2= (1004/2)*1005=502*1005. 502*1005 mod2010. Since 2010=2*3*5*67. Let&#39;s compute 502 mod 2=0, 502 mod3=502-3*167=502-501=1, 502 mod5=502-5*100=502-500=2, 502 mod67=502-67*7=502-469=33. So 502 ≡ (0,1,2,33) mod(2,3,5,67). Similarly, 1005 mod2=1, 1005 mod3=0, 1005 mod5=0, 1005 mod67=1005-67*15=1005-1005=0. Therefore, 1005 ≡ (1,0,0,0) mod(2,3,5,67). Therefore, 502*1005 mod2: 0*1=0. mod3:1*0=0. mod5:2*0=0. mod67:33*0=0. Therefore, 502*1005 ≡0 mod2010. Therefore, S_{1004}=0 mod2010. So 0 is already achieved at k=1004. Therefore, the initial 0 is already included in the set {S_k}, so the total number of unique people is just the number of unique S_k&#39;s.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod2010 for k from 1 to2009.Alternatively, since when k=1004, S_{1004}=0, so 0 is included in the S_k&#39;s. Therefore, the total number of unique positions is equal to the number of distinct S_k&#39;s. Therefore, we need to compute the size of { S_k | 1 ≤k ≤2009 } where S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod2010.So how can we compute this? Since modulus is 2010=2*3*5*67, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me recall that if we can find the number of distinct residues modulo each prime power in the factorization, then the total number is the product of these numbers. However, 2010 factors into distinct primes, each to the first power. So the CRT decomposition is into mod2, mod3, mod5, mod67. So for each prime p in {2,3,5,67}, compute the number of distinct residues of S_k modulo p, then multiply them together, and that will be the total number of distinct residues modulo2010. Let me check if this is valid.Yes, because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem: if two numbers are congruent modulo 2010, then they are congruent modulo each of its prime factors. Conversely, if they are congruent modulo each prime factor, they are congruent modulo 2010. Therefore, the number of distinct residues modulo 2010 is the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each prime factor. Therefore, if for each prime p dividing 2010, we can find the number of distinct residues of S_k modulo p, then multiply them together to get the total number.So let&#39;s compute for each prime p in {2,3,5,67}, the number of distinct values of k(k+1)/2 mod p, where k ranges from 1 to N, where N=2009. But since k ranges up to 2009, which is one less than 2010, which is 0 mod p for each p? Wait, 2010 is 0 mod2,3,5,67. So 2009 ≡ -1 mod p for each p. So for modulus p, k ranges from1 to p-1-1= p-2? Wait, maybe not. Let me see:For modulus 2: k ranges from1 to2009, which is equivalent to k from1 to1 mod2 (since 2009 is odd). Wait, 2009=2*1004 +1, so k ranges from1 to2*1004+1. So modulo2, k cycles every2. So how many residues do we have modulo2?Similarly, for modulus3, k ranges from1 to2009, which is 3*669 +2, so k ranges over all residues modulo3 multiple times. Wait, but perhaps since k runs through all residues modulo p, except for 0 modulo p? Wait, 2009 ≡ p-1 modulo p for each prime p dividing2010. So 2009 ≡1 mod2, 2009≡2 mod3, 2009≡4 mod5, 2009≡2009 mod67. Wait, 2009 divided by67 is 2009 /67=29.985, so 67*29=1943, 2009-1943=66, so 2009≡66 mod67. So 2009≡-1 mod67. So k ranges up to p-1 for modulus p? Not exactly. For modulus p, the sequence k runs from1 to N where N=2009. So modulo p, k runs from1 to N mod p. Wait, but for each prime p, k will take on all residues from1 to p-1 multiple times, except for the last partial cycle.But maybe it&#39;s easier to consider that when considering S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod p, we can have k from1 to p-1, and see how many distinct S_k there are, then consider that the total sequence from1 to2009 will cycle every p numbers. But given that 2009 ≡-1 mod p for each p (since 2010 is 0 mod p, so 2009 ≡-1 mod p). So for modulus p, k ranges from1 to p-1, and then 1 to p-1 again, etc., and finally 1 to p-1 again, but since 2009 = (m*p) + (p-1), but wait, 2010 is divisible by p, so 2009=2010-1= -1 mod p. So 2009= (multiple of p) -1. Therefore, for modulus p, k runs through 1 to p-1, then 0 to p-1, etc., but since k starts at1, the number of terms is 2009. For modulus p, the period of k(k+1)/2 mod p is probably p, since each increment of k by p would lead to S_{k+p} = (k+p)(k+p+1)/2 = (k(k+1)/2) + p(2k + p +1)/2. But modulo p, the second term is 0. Therefore, S_{k+p} ≡ S_k mod p. Therefore, the sequence S_k mod p is periodic with period p.Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod p in the sequence S_k for k from1 to N (where N=2009) is equal to the number of distinct residues in k from1 to p, since after p terms, it repeats. However, since N=2009 ≡-1 mod p, the number of complete cycles is floor(N/p), and then there&#39;s a remaining -1 mod p terms. But since the period is p, and we have m = floor(N/p) complete cycles and then r = N mod p remaining terms. However, since N=2009= (2010/p -1)*p + (p-1). Wait, 2010= p*q, so N= p*q -1. So N= p*q -1, so floor(N/p)=q -1, and N mod p= p -1. Therefore, the total number of terms is (q -1)*p + (p -1) = q*p -p + p -1= q*p -1= N. So for modulus p, the sequence S_k mod p is periodic with period p, and we have q -1 complete periods and then p -1 terms. However, since each period contains the same residues, the total number of distinct residues is the same as in one period. Wait, no, because in each period, the residues might not cover all possible residues. So perhaps the number of distinct residues in S_k mod p is equal to the number of distinct residues in one period, since each period is the same. However, if we have multiple periods, we still only get the same residues. Therefore, the total number of distinct residues mod p in the entire sequence is equal to the number of distinct residues in k(k+1)/2 mod p for k from1 to p. But since S_k mod p is periodic with period p, then the residues repeat every p terms. Therefore, over the entire sequence, since we have N= p*q -1 terms, which is equivalent to q -1 full periods (each of p terms) plus p -1 terms. However, since the residues repeat every p terms, the total distinct residues would be the same as in one period (p terms). But since the last p -1 terms are just the first p -1 terms of the next period, which are already included in the first period. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod p is equal to the number of distinct residues in k(k+1)/2 mod p for k from1 to p.Wait, but when k goes from1 to p, S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod p. Let me check for small primes.Take p=2:For p=2, S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod2. Let k=1: 1*2/2=1 mod2=1. k=2:2*3/2=3 mod2=1. So for p=2, all S_k ≡1 mod2. So there is only 1 distinct residue mod2.Wait, but when k=1: S_1=1*2/2=1 mod2=1.k=2:2*3/2=3 mod2=1.k=3:3*4/2=6 mod2=0.Wait, hold on, wait k ranges up to p=2, but in the first period, k=1,2.Wait, no, if the period is p=2, then k=1,2,3,..., but S_{k+p} ≡ S_k mod p. So S_3=3*4/2=6 ≡0 mod2. But 3≡1 mod2, so S_3 ≡S_1 mod2. Wait, but S_3=6≡0 mod2. Hmm, this contradicts the earlier thought. Wait, perhaps the period is not p? Maybe my earlier assertion was incorrect.Wait, let me compute S_k mod2 for k=1,2,3,4:k=1:1*2/2=1 mod2=1.k=2:2*3/2=3 mod2=1.k=3:3*4/2=6 mod2=0.k=4:4*5/2=10 mod2=0.k=5:5*6/2=15 mod2=1.k=6:6*7/2=21 mod2=1.So the residues mod2 are 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,... So period of 2? Wait, from k=1 to k=4, the residues are 1,1,0,0. Then k=5:1, k=6:1, etc. So it seems that the period is 4? But that complicates things.Wait, maybe the period is not straightforward. Let&#39;s try to find the period for S_k mod2.Since S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod2. Let&#39;s note that k(k+1)/2 is equal to the sum from1 to k, which is an integer. For modulo2:If k is even: k=2m. Then S_k =2m(2m +1)/2= m(2m+1). 2m+1 is odd, so m*(2m+1) mod2 is equal to m mod2.If k is odd: k=2m+1. Then S_k=(2m+1)(2m+2)/2=(2m+1)(m+1). Which is (2m+1)(m+1) mod2. Since 2m+1 is odd, and m+1 mod2 is (m mod2)+1. Therefore, the product mod2 is (m mod2 +1) mod2.Therefore:If k even: S_k ≡m mod2, where m=k/2.If k odd: S_k ≡ (m +1) mod2, where m=(k-1)/2.So let&#39;s write this down:For k even: Let k=2m. Then S_k ≡m mod2.For k odd: k=2m+1. Then S_k≡(m +1) mod2.Therefore, the sequence S_k mod2 is:k=1 (odd, m=0): (0 +1)=1 mod2.k=2 (even, m=1):1 mod2.k=3 (odd, m=1): (1 +1)=0 mod2.k=4 (even, m=2):0 mod2.k=5 (odd, m=2): (2 +1)=1 mod2.k=6 (even, m=3):1 mod2.k=7 (odd, m=3): (3 +1)=0 mod2.k=8 (even, m=4):0 mod2.So the pattern is 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,... repeating every4 terms. Therefore, the period is4 for mod2.But 2010=2*3*5*67, so modulus2. However, the original problem has k from1 to2009. Since2009 is odd, the number of terms is2009. So how does this sequence progress?Since the period is4, every4 terms, the residues repeat. The number of complete periods in2009 terms is2009//4=502 periods, with a remainder of1 term. Each period contributes two 1s and two 0s. But since we start at k=1, let&#39;s see:First term (k=1):1.Then a period of4 terms: k=1:1, k=2:1, k=3:0, k=4:0. Then next period: k=5:1, k=6:1, k=7:0, k=8:0, etc.But wait, in each period of4 terms, starting at k=4n +1, the residues are1,1,0,0. So over 502 periods (4*502=2008 terms), we have residues1,1,0,0 repeated502 times. Then the remaining1 term (k=2009) is part of the next period, which would be k=2009=4*502 +1, so residue1.Therefore, total residues mod2: In the 502 periods, each has two1s and two0s. Then the last term is1. Therefore, the total residues mod2 are0 and1. Wait, but in the sequence, we have both0s and1s. Wait, but how many distinct residues do we have? For modulus2, there are only two residues,0 and1. But depending on the sequence, the number of distinct residues could be2 or1. However, in our case, since the sequence alternates between1,1,0,0,..., we have both0 and1 appearing. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod2 is2.Wait, but earlier computation showed that for k=1, residue1; k=2, residue1; k=3,0; k=4,0; etc. So in the entire sequence, we do get both0 and1. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod2 is2.Wait, but when k=1004, we had S_{1004}≡0 mod2010, which implies S_{1004}≡0 mod2 as well. Therefore,0 is included in the residues. So yes, mod2, we have two residues:0 and1. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod2 is2.Wait, but earlier I thought that S_k mod2 for k from1 to p=2 gives residues1,1, but when considering the period, we see that residues are1,1,0,0, so over k=1 to4, we get both1 and0. So perhaps the number of distinct residues mod2 is2.Similarly, for modulus3, let&#39;s compute S_k mod3.S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod3.Let&#39;s compute S_k for k=1 to6 (since modulus3, period might be6? Let&#39;s see):k=1:1*2/2=1 mod3.k=2:2*3/2=3 mod3=0.k=3:3*4/2=6 mod3=0.k=4:4*5/2=10 mod3=1.k=5:5*6/2=15 mod3=0.k=6:6*7/2=21 mod3=0.k=7:7*8/2=28 mod3=1.k=8:8*9/2=36 mod3=0.k=9:9*10/2=45 mod3=0.Hmm, so residues:1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,... So period3? Wait, from k=1:1,0,0,1,0,0,... So the pattern repeats every3 terms? Wait, k=1:1, k=2:0, k=3:0, k=4:1 (which is k=4=3+1), so same as k=1. Yes, so period3.Therefore, every3 terms, the residues are1,0,0. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod3 is2:0 and1.But let&#39;s verify:For k ≡1 mod3: k=3m+1. Then S_k=(3m+1)(3m+2)/2. Let&#39;s compute mod3: numerator=(3m+1)(3m+2)=9m² +9m +2≡2 mod3. So S_k≡2/2=1 mod3.For k≡2 mod3: k=3m+2. Then S_k=(3m+2)(3m+3)/2=(3m+2)(3(m+1))/2. The numerator is divisible by3, so S_k≡0 mod3.For k≡0 mod3: k=3m. Then S_k=3m(3m+1)/2. Numerator divisible by3, so S_k≡0 mod3.Therefore, residues mod3:- If k≡1 mod3:1- If k≡2 or0 mod3:0Therefore, the residues mod3 are0 and1, so number of distinct residues mod3 is2.Similarly, check for p=5:Compute S_k mod5 for k=1 to, say,10:k=1:1 mod5.k=2:3 mod5.k=3:6 mod5=1.k=4:10 mod5=0.k=5:15 mod5=0.k=6:21 mod5=1.k=7:28 mod5=3.k=8:36 mod5=1.k=9:45 mod5=0.k=10:55 mod5=0.So residues:1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0. So the pattern seems to repeat every5 terms? Let&#39;s see:k=1:1k=2:3k=3:1k=4:0k=5:0k=6:1 (k=5+1)k=7:3 (k=5+2)k=8:1 (k=5+3)k=9:0 (k=5+4)k=10:0 (k=5+5)Yes, the pattern repeats every5 terms. So the residues mod5 are1,3,1,0,0 repeating. Therefore, the distinct residues mod5 are0,1,3. So three distinct residues.Let me confirm with general formula:For modulus5, S_k=k(k+1)/2 mod5. Let&#39;s consider k modulo5.For k≡0 mod5: S_k=0*1/2=0 mod5.k≡1 mod5:1*2/2=1 mod5.k≡2 mod5:2*3/2=3 mod5.k≡3 mod5:3*4/2=6≡1 mod5.k≡4 mod5:4*5/2=10≡0 mod5.Therefore, residues mod5:k≡0:0k≡1:1k≡2:3k≡3:1k≡4:0Therefore, the residues are0,1,3. So three distinct residues.Therefore, number of distinct residues mod5 is3.Similarly, for modulus67, which is a larger prime. Let&#39;s try to determine the number of distinct residues of S_k =k(k+1)/2 mod67.To find the number of distinct residues, we can note that S_k = (k² +k)/2 mod67. Let me consider the function f(k)= (k² +k)/2 mod67. We need to find the number of distinct values f(k) can take as k ranges from1 to66 (since modulus67, and k up to66 before repeating). But since our k goes up to2009, which is≡66 mod67 (since2010=67*30, so2009=67*30 -1=2010-1=2009≡-1 mod67). Therefore, k ranges from1 to66 mod67, repeated30 times, and then from1 to66 again, but since2009=67*30 -1=2010-1, the total number of terms is30*67 -1=2010-1=2009. Therefore, k cycles through1 to66 thirty times, and then one more time from1 to66-1=65? Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify:Since k ranges from1 to2009, and2009=67*30 -1. Therefore, the sequence of k mod67 is1,2,...,66,1,2,...,66,...,1,2,...,65 (since30 full cycles would be30*67=2010, but we have one less, so30 full cycles minus1 term). Therefore, the residues k mod67 run from1 to66 thirty times, and then1 to65 once. However, when considering the function f(k)= (k² +k)/2 mod67, since the function is defined over k in1 to66 mod67, and in the last partial cycle, k goes from1 to65. However, since the problem is about distinct residues, even if some residues are repeated in different cycles, the total number of distinct residues is determined by how many distinct f(k) there are for k from1 to66.Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod67 is equal to the number of distinct values of (k² +k)/2 mod67 for k from1 to67-1=66.But this is equivalent to solving for the number of distinct quadratic residues of the form(k² +k)/2 mod67.Alternatively, consider that f(k) = (k² +k)/2 = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67.Let’s make a substitution: let j = 2k +1 mod67. Wait, completing the square:k² +k = k² +k + (1/4 -1/4) = (k + 0.5)^2 -0.25. But since we are working modulo67, which is a prime, and67 is odd, 0.5 is equivalent to the inverse of2 mod67. Since2*34=68≡1 mod67, so inverse of2 is34. Therefore, 0.5≡34 mod67.Therefore, k² +k = (k +34)^2 -34² -0.25. Wait, let me compute:k² +k = k² +k + (1/4 -1/4) = (k + 1/2)^2 -1/4.So modulo67, this is (k +34)^2 -34² -1/4. Wait, maybe this approach is getting messy. Alternatively, since f(k) = (k² +k)/2, we can write this as (k(k+1))/2 mod67.Note that k and k+1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, k and k+1 cannot both be even, so exactly one of them is even, hence k(k+1)/2 is an integer.We can consider the function f(k) = k(k+1)/2 mod67. Let&#39;s see if this function is injective or how many collisions it has.Suppose f(k1)=f(k2). Then k1(k1+1)/2 ≡k2(k2+1)/2 mod67.Multiply both sides by2: k1(k1+1) ≡k2(k2+1) mod67.Rearrange: k1² +k1 -k2² -k2 ≡0 mod67.Factor: (k1² -k2²) + (k1 -k2) ≡0 mod67.Factor further: (k1 -k2)(k1 +k2) + (k1 -k2) ≡0 mod67.Factor out(k1 -k2): (k1 -k2)(k1 +k2 +1) ≡0 mod67.Therefore, either k1 ≡k2 mod67, or k1 +k2 +1 ≡0 mod67.Therefore, the solutions to f(k1)=f(k2) are either k1=k2 or k1 +,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem where 2010 people are sitting around a round table. We start by giving a candy to one person, let&#39;s call them person x. Then, we continue giving candies to the 1st person clockwise from x, then the 1+2=3rd person from x, then 1+2+3=6th person, and so on, up until the sum 1+2+...+2009. We need to find out how many people end up getting at least one candy. First, I need to visualize the setup. It&#39;s a circular table with 2010 people. Starting at person x, each subsequent candy is given to the person who is the next triangular number of positions away from x. So the first candy is at position x, then moving 1 step clockwise to x+1, then 3 steps from x (which would be x+1+3 = x+4?), wait, maybe I need to clarify how the steps work here. Wait, the problem says: &quot;give candies to 1st person, 1+2 th person, 1+2+3 th person, etc., clockwise from x.&quot; Hmm, maybe it&#39;s not cumulative steps each time. Let me parse that again. First, give a candy to person x. Then, the next candy is given to the 1st person clockwise from x. Then the next candy is given to the (1+2)=3rd person clockwise from x. Then the (1+2+3)=6th person, and so on, up to the sum 1+2+...+2009. So each time, it&#39;s the nth triangular number position from x, not cumulative steps from the previous position. So starting at x, each subsequent candy is T_k positions clockwise from x, where T_k is the k-th triangular number. So the positions would be x, x + T_1, x + T_2, ..., x + T_{2009} modulo 2010. So we need to find how many unique positions are covered by all these triangular numbers modulo 2010. Since the table is circular, all positions are modulo 2010. So the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct values of the triangular numbers T_k = k(k+1)/2 mod 2010, for k from 0 to 2009, where T_0 = 0 corresponds to the starting person x. Then, the answer is the number of distinct residues T_k mod 2010. So the key is to compute the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010. Then, since the starting person x is counted as the first candy, and then the rest are triangular numbers starting from k=1 up to k=2009. Wait, actually, the first candy is x (which is T_0 = 0), then the next is T_1 = 1, T_2 = 3, T_3 = 6, etc., up to T_{2009}. So we need the number of distinct values in the set { T_k mod 2010 | k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2009 }, which would be the number of people who get at least one candy.Therefore, the problem becomes a question about the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010. The answer will be the size of the set { k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 | k = 0, 1, ..., 2009 }.To compute this, perhaps we need to factor 2010 and analyze the problem modulo each prime power factor, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let&#39;s factor 2010 first. 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. So the modulus is 2*3*5*67. Therefore, the number of distinct residues modulo 2010 is equal to the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each prime power factor. So if we can compute the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2, 3, 5, and 67, then multiply them together, that would give the answer. Wait, but 2, 3, 5, and 67 are all primes, not prime powers. Since 2010 is square-free, so each prime power is just the prime itself.But let me verify if that&#39;s the correct approach. For modulus m = m1 * m2 * ... * mk where the mi are pairwise coprime, then the number of distinct residues modulo m is equal to the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each mi. So if we can find the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2, 3, 5, and 67, then multiply them together, that gives the total number modulo 2010. Therefore, yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the plan is:1. For each prime factor p of 2010 (which are 2, 3, 5, 67), compute the number of distinct triangular numbers T_k = k(k+1)/2 mod p for k from 0 to p-1 (since triangular numbers modulo p repeat every p numbers). Wait, but here k goes up to 2009, which is much larger than p. So maybe the period is p, but we need to confirm.Wait, actually, triangular numbers modulo m have a period. The triangular numbers T_k mod m repeat with some period. For prime modulus p, the period might be p or something else. Let&#39;s check for example p=2.Triangular numbers mod 2:k: 0 1 2 3 4 ...T_k:0,1,3,6,10,... mod2: 0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,... So period 4? Wait, let&#39;s compute:k | T_k | T_k mod20 | 0 | 01 | 1 | 12 | 3 | 13 | 6 | 04 |10 | 05 |15 |16 |21 |17 |28 |0So yes, mod2, the sequence is 0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,... which repeats every 4. So the period is 4. But since we are considering k from 0 to 2009, which is 2010 terms. 2010 divided by 4 is 502.5, so the cycle repeats 502 full times and then half. However, since 2010 is even, 2010 = 4*502 + 2. So maybe the number of residues mod2 is the same as the number in one period? Let&#39;s check. In one period of 4, the residues are 0,1,1,0. So distinct residues are 0 and1. So mod2, there are 2 residues. But wait, if we consider k from 0 to 3, the residues are 0,1,1,0. So even though the period is 4, the number of distinct residues is 2. However, if we consider k up to 2009, which is equivalent to k from 0 to 2009, which is 2010 terms. But mod2, the triangular numbers cycle every 4. Wait, but 2010 is equal to 2 mod4. So in 2010 terms, how many full cycles? Each cycle is 4 terms. 2010 divided by4 is 502 cycles and 2 remaining terms. Each cycle contributes 2 residues (0,1,1,0). So over 502 cycles, you have 502*2 residues, but since the cycle is 0,1,1,0, the residues are 0 and1. The last two terms would be cycle positions 0 and1, which are 0 and1. So total residues mod2 would still be 0 and1. So mod2, the number of residues is 2.Similarly, for modulus3:Let&#39;s compute T_k mod3 for k from0 to5:k=0:0; k=1:1; k=2:3 mod3=0; k=3:6 mod3=0; k=4:10 mod3=1; k=5:15 mod3=0; k=6:21 mod3=0; k=7:28 mod3=1; k=8:36 mod3=0; etc.So mod3, the residues cycle every 3 terms? Wait:k | T_k | T_k mod30 |0 |01 |1 |12 |3 |03 |6 |04 |10 |15 |15 |06 |21 |07 |28 |1So the pattern is 0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,... So period of 3? Wait, starting from k=0:0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,... So the cycle is 1,0,0 repeating? Wait, from k=1: T_1=1, T_2=3=0, T_3=6=0, T_4=10=1, T_5=15=0, T_6=21=0, etc. So the cycle seems to be 1,0,0,1,0,0,... with period 3. So the residues mod3 are 0,1. Let&#39;s check: when k mod3 =0: T_k = k(k+1)/2. If k=3m, then T_k =3m(3m +1)/2. Mod3, that&#39;s 0*(3m +1)/2 mod3. Wait, but division by2 is multiplication by inverse of2 mod3, which is2. So 0*(3m +1)*2 mod3=0. If k=3m+1: T_k=(3m+1)(3m+2)/2=(9m² +9m +2)/2. Mod3, numerator is0 +0 +2=2, multiplied by2 inverse is2*2=4≡1 mod3. Similarly, k=3m+2: T_k=(3m+2)(3m+3)/2=(3m+2)(3m+3)/2=(9m² +15m +6)/2. Mod3: numerator 0 +0 +0=0. So T_k≡0 mod3. Therefore, the residues mod3 are:If k ≡0 mod3: 0k ≡1 mod3:1k ≡2 mod3:0Therefore, the residues mod3 are0 and1. So number of distinct residues mod3 is2.Wait, but when k=3m+1, T_k≡1 mod3, and for k=3m or3m+2, T_k≡0 mod3. So regardless of m, only 0 and1. So mod3, there are2 residues.Similarly, mod5:Compute T_k mod5 for k from0 to, say,10:k=0:0k=1:1k=2:3k=3:6≡1k=4:10≡0k=5:15≡0k=6:21≡1k=7:28≡3k=8:36≡1k=9:45≡0k=10:55≡0So the residues mod5 are:0,1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0. So seems like a cycle of length5? Let&#39;s see.But when k=0:0, k=1:1, k=2:3, k=3:1, k=4:0, k=5:0, k=6:1, k=7:3, etc. So the pattern from k=0 to4 is0,1,3,1,0. Then k=5 is0, k=6 is1, k=7 is3, etc. So cycle length is5. The residues mod5 over k=0 to4 are0,1,3,1,0. So distinct residues are0,1,3. So three residues. Then, for k=5 to9: same as k=0 to4, shifted. So yes, cycle length5, and in each cycle, the residues are0,1,3,1,0. So distinct residues per cycle are0,1,3. So mod5, the number of distinct triangular numbers is3.Similarly, mod67. Since 67 is a larger prime, it&#39;s more involved, but perhaps there&#39;s a pattern.But before moving to 67, let&#39;s recap. For modulus2,3,5, the number of distinct triangular numbers are2,2,3. Then for modulus67, we need to compute the number of distinct T_k mod67, which would be the number of distinct k(k+1)/2 mod67 for k from0 to66 (since the period is at most67). Wait, but since we are considering k up to2009, but modulo67, the triangular numbers T_k mod67 repeat every67*2=134? Wait, the triangular numbers have a period of 2m when modulus is m. Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall that the sequence T_k mod m has period equal to m if m is odd, and 2m if m is even? Maybe. For example, mod2, the period was4, which is2*2. Mod3, period was3. Wait, mod2, period4, mod3 period3, mod5 period5. Hmm. Maybe when modulus is prime p, the period is p if p is odd, and 2p if p=2? Let me check:For modulus3, the period was3. For modulus5, the period was5. For modulus2, the period was4. So maybe for odd primes, the period is p, and for p=2, period is4. So if that&#39;s the case, for modulus67 (prime), the period is67. Therefore, the residues of T_k mod67 for k from0 to66 will repeat every67. Therefore, to compute the number of distinct residues mod67, we need to compute the number of distinct T_k =k(k+1)/2 mod67 for k=0,1,...,66.Similarly, for modulus2,3,5, the number of residues are2,2,3, and for modulus67, let&#39;s compute how many residues there are.So first, let&#39;s tackle modulus67. How many distinct values of k(k+1)/2 mod67 are there as k ranges from0 to66.Note that k(k+1)/2 mod67. Let&#39;s set T_k = k(k+1)/2 mod67. Let&#39;s note that T_k = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67. So this is equivalent to solving the equation y = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67. Multiplying both sides by2 (since67 is odd, 2 is invertible mod67; inverse of2 is34, since2*34=68≡1 mod67). So 2y ≡k^2 +k mod67. Then, completing the square:k^2 +k + (1/4) ≡ 2y +1/4 mod67But 1/4 mod67 is the inverse of4, which is17, since4*17=68≡1 mod67. So 1/4 ≡17 mod67.Therefore,k^2 +k +17 ≡2y +17 mod67Left side: (k + 0.5)^2. Wait, but working mod67, fractions are tricky. Let me think again.Starting from 2y ≡k^2 +k mod67.Multiply both sides by4 to complete the square:8y ≡4k^2 +4k mod67Then, 4k^2 +4k +1 ≡8y +1 mod67Thus, (2k +1)^2 ≡8y +1 mod67Therefore, for each y, there is a solution if and only if8y +1 is a quadratic residue mod67. So the equation (2k +1)^2 ≡8y +1 mod67. Therefore, 8y +1 must be a quadratic residue mod67. Since67 is a prime congruent to3 mod4 (67 divided by4 is16.75, so 67≡3 mod4). Wait, 67=4*16 +3, yes. Therefore, the number of quadratic residues mod67 is(67-1)/2=33. But since we have a bijection here between y and the quadratic residues, perhaps each quadratic residue gives two solutions for k, unless the discriminant is zero.But let&#39;s step back. For each y, how many solutions k are there?From the equation (2k +1)^2 ≡8y +1 mod67. For each quadratic residue of8y +1, there are two solutions for2k +1, hence two solutions fork, unless8y +1 ≡0 mod67, which would give one solution. So the number of distinct y is equal to the number of distinct quadratic residues (including0) such that8y +1 is a quadratic residue or0.Wait, but8y +1 can be any value mod67. The mapping from y to8y +1 is a bijection since8 is invertible mod67. Since8 and67 are coprime, multiplication by8 is a bijection. Therefore,8y +1 mod67 covers all residues from1 to67 as y ranges from0 to66. Therefore, the number of quadratic residues of the form8y +1 is equal to the number of quadratic residues mod67, which is(67 +1)/2=34. Wait, no, the number of quadratic residues mod p is(p-1)/2 when p is an odd prime. So for p=67, there are33 quadratic residues (excluding0), and including0, there are34. But8y +1 can be0 mod67 if8y +1≡0 → y≡ -1/8 ≡ -1*34 ≡-34≡33 mod67. So when y=33,8y +1=8*33 +1=264 +1=265≡265 -3*67=265-201=64≡64 mod67. Wait, that&#39;s not0. Wait, 8y +1≡0 mod67 →8y≡-1 mod67 →y≡ (-1)/8 mod67. The inverse of8 mod67: 8* x ≡1 mod67. Find x: 67=8*8 +3; 8=3*2 +2;3=2*1 +1. Backwards:1=3-2*1=3 - (8 -3*2)*1=3 -8 +3*2=2*3 -8=2*(67 -8*8) -8=2*67 -16*8 -8=2*67 -17*8. Therefore, -17*8≡1 mod67→ 8*(-17)≡1 mod67. So inverse of8 is-17 mod67≡50. Therefore, y≡(-1)/8≡-1*50≡-50≡17 mod67. So y=17. Then8*17 +1=136 +1=137≡137 -2*67=137-134=3≡3 mod67. Wait, that&#39;s not0 either. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.Wait, let me compute 8y +1≡0 mod67 ⇒8y≡-1 mod67⇒ y≡ (-1)/8 mod67. As above, inverse of8 is50. So y≡ -1*50≡-50≡17 mod67. Then8*17=136≡136-2*67=136-134=2⇒8*17 +1=3≡3 mod67. Hmm, that&#39;s not0. So I must have messed up the inverse.Wait, let&#39;s do it step by step. Find x such that8x≡1 mod67.We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.Compute gcd(8,67):67 = 8*8 + 38 = 3*2 + 23 = 2*1 +12 =1*2 +0So gcd=1.Now backtracking:1 =3 -2*1But2=8 -3*2So1=3 - (8 -3*2)*1=3 -8 +3*2=3*3 -8But3=67 -8*8So1= (67 -8*8)*3 -8=67*3 -8*24 -8=67*3 -8*25Therefore, -25*8 +3*67=1So inverse of8 mod67 is-25≡42 mod67 (since67-25=42). So inverse of8 is42. Therefore, y≡-1*42≡-42≡25 mod67. So y=25. Then check8*25 +1=200 +1=201≡201 -3*67=201-201=0 mod67. Yes, correct. So when y=25,8y +1=0 mod67. Therefore, the equation(2k +1)^2≡0 mod67 implies2k +1≡0 mod67, so2k≡-1 mod67, sok≡(-1)/2 mod67. Inverse of2 is34, sok≡-34≡33 mod67. Therefore, when y=25, there is exactly one solutionk=33. For other y, if8y +1 is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions for k. If8y +1 is a non-residue, no solutions. Therefore, the number of y such that8y +1 is a quadratic residue or0 is equal to (number of quadratic residues +1)/something. Wait, since8y +1 is a bijection, the number of quadratic residues in8y +1 is equal to the number of quadratic residues mod67, which is(67 -1)/2=33. Including the case when8y +1=0 (which is a square), total is33 +1=34. Therefore, there are34 values of y where8y +1 is a quadratic residue or0. Each of these corresponds to either one or two values ofk. Specifically, for the case8y +1=0 (y=25), there is one k=33. For the other33 quadratic residues, each gives two values ofk. Therefore, total number of k is1 +33*2=67. But k ranges from0 to66, which is67 values. Therefore, each y corresponds to exactly one k, except when8y +1 is a quadratic residue, in which case there are two k&#39;s. Wait, but this seems conflicting.Wait, let&#39;s think again. The equation(2k +1)^2≡8y +1 mod67. For each y, if8y +1 is a quadratic residue, then there are two solutions for2k +1, hence two solutions fork. If8y +1=0, then one solution fork. If8y +1 is a non-residue, no solution. However, sincek ranges from0 to66, and for each k, there is a y such thaty=(k(k+1)/2) mod67. Therefore, the mapping fromk to y is surjective. Therefore, the number of distinct y is equal to the number of orbits under the mappingk ↦ y. But each quadratic residue gives two k&#39;s mapping to the same y, except when8y +1=0. Therefore, total number of distinct y is (number of quadratic residues -1)/2 +1. Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:For each non-zero quadratic residue in8y +1, there are two k&#39;s mapping to the same y. But since8y +1 is a bijection, the number of quadratic residues is33 (excluding0). So for each of these33 quadratic residues, there are two k&#39;s, leading to33 pairs of k&#39;s mapping to the same y. The case when8y +1=0 gives one k mapping to y=25. Therefore, total distinct y&#39;s are33 +1=34. Therefore, the number of distinct triangular numbers mod67 is34.Wait, but if we have33 quadratic residues (excluding0), each contributing two k&#39;s, leading to33 y&#39;s (since two k&#39;s map to the same y), and one y from the zero case. So total y&#39;s would be33 +1=34. Yes. Therefore, mod67, there are34 distinct triangular numbers.Therefore, putting it all together:mod2:2 residuesmod3:2 residuesmod5:3 residuesmod67:34 residuesBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since2,3,5,67 are pairwise coprime, the number of distinct residues modulo2010=2*3*5*67 is2*2*3*34=2*2=4; 4*3=12; 12*34=408. So the total number of distinct triangular numbers modulo2010 is408.But wait, let me verify this conclusion. If for each modulus, the number of residues is multiplicative, then yes, the total is the product. But we need to ensure that for each combination of residues mod2,3,5,67, there is a unique residue mod2010. Since the moduli are coprime, this holds. Therefore, the number of distinct triangular numbers mod2010 is indeed the product of the numbers for each modulus.But hold on, we need to confirm that for each prime p dividing2010, the number of residues modp is as computed, and then multiply them. But in our earlier calculations, for modulus2,3,5, we found the number of residues, but in reality, the problem states that k ranges up to2009. However, since the triangular numbers modm have period dividing2m, but in our case, since2010 is divisible by each of2,3,5,67, and each modulus is prime (except2, which is prime power2^1), then the number of residues is as computed.But wait, in modulus2,3,5,67, we considered k from0 top-1 (since the period isp). But in the original problem, k ranges up to2009. However, since2009 is equal to-1 mod2,3,5,67. For example,2009 mod2=1, mod3=2009=3*669 +2=2 mod3, mod5=2009=5*401 +4=4 mod5, mod67=2009=67*29 +66=66 mod67. So the maximum k is2009, which is one less than the modulus2010. But when considering each prime modulus, since k can be up top-1 (as in modulus2, k can be0,1; modulus3,0,1,2; etc.), but in the original problem, k ranges up to2009. However, for modulusp, since the triangular numbers modp have a period ofp (for odd primes) or4 (for2), then k beyondp would repeat residues. Therefore, when k ranges up to2009, which is equivalent to k=0,...,2009, the residues modp would cycle multiple times through their periods.But wait, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is as we computed earlier: for modulusp=2, there are2 residues; p=3,2; p=5,3; p=67,34. However, these numbers were computed by considering k from0 top-1 (since they repeat everyp). However, when k ranges up to a number larger thanp, but not a multiple ofp, the number of residues might be the same. Wait, for example, modulus3: the residues cycle every3. If k goes up to2009, which is2 mod3, then the number of residues would be the same as when k goes up to2. Which in modulus3, the residues are0,1. Similarly, for modulus5, even though k goes up to2009, which is4 mod5, the residues would still be0,1,3 as computed.Therefore, the number of residues modp is independent of how many times k cycles, as long as k covers at least one full period. However, in our case, when modulus is2,3,5,67, the periods are4,3,5,67 respectively. Since2009 is greater than all of these, the number of residues is the same as the number of residues in one full period. Therefore, our earlier counts hold.Therefore, the total number of distinct triangular numbers modulo2010 is2*2*3*34=408.But wait, the problem says &quot;the number of people who get at least one candy&quot;. The first candy is given to personx (which is T_0=0), and then T_1, T_2,...,T_{2009}. So we need to count the number of distinct T_k mod2010 for k=0 to2009. Which we just calculated as408. Therefore, is the answer408?Wait, but let me verify with smaller cases. Let&#39;s take modulus6=2*3. Then, compute number of distinct triangular numbers mod6.Compute T_k mod6 for k=0 to5:k=0:0k=1:1k=2:3k=3:6≡0k=4:10≡4k=5:15≡3So residues:0,1,3,4. So 4 residues. According to our formula, mod2:2 residues, mod3:2 residues. 2*2=4. Which matches. So the formula works here.Similarly, modulus10=2*5. Then, mod2:2 residues, mod5:3 residues. Total residues=6. Let&#39;s check:T_k mod10 for k=0 to9:0:01:12:33:64:10≡05:15≡56:21≡17:28≡88:36≡69:45≡5So residues:0,1,3,5,6,8. Total6 residues, which is2*3=6. Correct.Another example: modulus15=3*5. mod3:2 residues, mod5:3 residues. Total residues=6. Let&#39;s check T_k mod15:k=0:0k=1:1k=2:3k=3:6k=4:10k=5:15≡0k=6:21≡6k=7:28≡13k=8:36≡6k=9:45≡0k=10:55≡10k=11:66≡6k=12:78≡3k=13:91≡1k=14:105≡0Residues:0,1,3,6,10,13. So6 residues, which matches2*3=6. So formula holds.Therefore, our formula seems correct.Therefore, returning to the original problem, the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo2010 is2*2*3*34=408.Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.But wait, before finalizing, let me check modulus67. We concluded there are34 residues. Let me check with a smaller prime, say7.mod7: compute number of distinct triangular numbers. Let&#39;s compute T_k mod7 for k=0 to6:k=0:0k=1:1k=2:3k=3:6k=4:10≡3k=5:15≡1k=6:21≡0So residues:0,1,3,6. So4 residues. According to our formula, for p=7, the number of residues would be(7 +1)/2=4. Indeed,4 residues. So that formula works. For prime p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is⌈p/2⌉? Wait, p=7:4; p=5:3; p=3:2; p=2:2. Wait, in general, for odd prime p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is (p +1)/2. Because in the equation (2k +1)^2 ≡8y +1 modp, when p is odd, and we have a bijection between y and8y +1. The number of quadratic residues modp is (p-1)/2, and including the case when8y +1=0 (which is1 case), gives total (p-1)/2 +1=(p+1)/2. Hence, for prime p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is (p +1)/2.Ah, so in modulus67, which is a prime, the number of residues is(67 +1)/2=34. Which matches our previous calculation. Similarly, modulus5: (5 +1)/2=3. Correct. Modulus3: (3 +1)/2=2. Correct. Modulus2: (2 +1)/2=1.5, which doesn&#39;t fit, but modulus2 is a special case. However, we saw that mod2, there are2 residues. So perhaps for p=2, it&#39;s an exception. For odd primes, it&#39;s(p +1)/2. For p=2, it&#39;s2. Then, in the original problem, since2010=2*3*5*67, the number of residues is2*( (3+1)/2 )*( (5+1)/2 )*( (67+1)/2 )=2*2*3*34=408. Wait, but hold on, no:Wait, according to the general formula, for each prime p (odd), the number of residues is(p +1)/2. For p=2, it&#39;s2. Therefore, total number of residues modulo2010 is2*( (3+1)/2 )*( (5+1)/2 )*( (67+1)/2 )=2*2*3*34=408. But wait, actually, the formula is multiplicative because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Therefore, for modulus2:2 residues, modulus3: (3+1)/2=2, modulus5: (5+1)/2=3, modulus67: (67+1)/2=34. Then multiply them all:2*2*3*34=408. Therefore, the answer is408.Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.Final Answerboxed{408}&lt;/think&gt;We need to find the number of people who get at least one candy when given to the 1st, 1+2th, 1+2+3th, ..., up to the 1+2+⋯+2009th person clockwise from a starting person x around a round table with 2010 people. This problem reduces to finding the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010.1. Factorizing 2010:    [   2010 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 67   ]2. Calculating distinct triangular numbers modulo each prime factor:   - Modulo 2: The triangular numbers modulo 2 are 0 and 1. Thus, there are 2 distinct residues.   - Modulo 3: The triangular numbers modulo 3 are 0 and 1. Thus, there are 2 distinct residues.   - Modulo 5: The triangular numbers modulo 5 are 0, 1, and 3. Thus, there are 3 distinct residues.   - Modulo 67: For a prime ( p ), the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo ( p ) is ( frac{p + 1}{2} ). For ( p = 67 ), this gives ( frac{67 + 1}{2} = 34 ) distinct residues.3. Combining results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:   - The number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010 is the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each prime factor:   [   2 times 2 times 3 times 34 = 408   ]Thus, the number of people who get at least one candy is (boxed{408}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, there are 2010 people sitting around a round table. We start by giving a candy to person x. Then, we give candies to the 1st person clockwise from x, then the 1+2=3rd person from x, then 1+2+3=6th person, and so on, up to 1+2+...+2009th person. We need to find how many people end up getting at least one candy.First, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. The people are arranged in a circle, right? So, when we count positions, it wraps around if we go past the last person. We start at person x, then each subsequent candy is given to someone a certain number of positions clockwise from x. The positions are determined by triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, ..., which are the sums 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc. Each time, the number of steps we move clockwise is the next triangular number.So, the first candy is at position x. The next candy is 1 step from x, then 3 steps from x, then 6 steps, 10 steps, and so on until the sum 1+2+...+2009. Since there are 2010 people, moving 2010 steps would bring us back to x. But we&#39;re only summing up to 2009, so the last step is 1+2+...+2009 = (2009*2010)/2. Hmm, that&#39;s a huge number. But since the table is circular, we can take modulo 2010 to find the actual position.So, each candy is placed at position x + T_k mod 2010, where T_k is the k-th triangular number, for k from 0 to 2009 (since the first candy is T_0 = 0, which is x itself). Wait, actually, when they say &quot;1st person&quot;, &quot;1+2=3rd person&quot;, etc., does k start at 1 or 0? Let&#39;s check:First, we give one person x a candy. That&#39;s the starting point. Then, next, we give candies to 1st person, 1+2=3rd, 1+2+3=6th, etc. So, the first move is k=1 (sum of 1), next is k=2 (sum 1+2=3), up to k=2009 (sum 1+2+...+2009). So, the positions are x + T_k mod 2010, where T_k = k(k+1)/2 for k from 1 to 2009. Wait, but also including the initial x? So total candies given are 1 (initial) + 2009 (from k=1 to k=2009) = 2010 candies? But since there are 2010 people, maybe some people get multiple candies? But we need the number of people who get at least one candy.So, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct positions among x + T_k mod 2010 for k from 0 to 2009 (including the initial x, which is T_0 = 0). Therefore, the total number of distinct residues of T_k mod 2010, since x is fixed and the problem is rotationally symmetric.Therefore, we can assume x=0 without loss of generality, and the problem becomes finding the number of distinct values of T_k mod 2010, where T_k = k(k+1)/2, for k from 0 to 2009.So, restated: compute the number of distinct values of k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 for k in 0,1,...,2009.So, the key is to find the size of the set { k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 | k = 0,1,...,2009 }.Therefore, the answer is the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010. Now, 2010 factors into primes as 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. So, modulus is composite, and perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to compute the number of distinct residues modulo each prime power factor, then multiply them together.But first, let&#39;s factorize 2010:2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67.Therefore, by CRT, the number of distinct residues modulo 2010 is equal to the product of the number of distinct residues modulo each of its prime power factors. Since 2010 is square-free, the prime power factors are 2, 3, 5, 67.Therefore, if we can compute N_2, N_3, N_5, N_67, the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2, 3, 5, 67 respectively, then the total number is N = N_2 * N_3 * N_5 * N_67.So, let&#39;s compute each N_p for p in {2, 3, 5, 67}.First, for modulus 2:Triangular numbers T_k = k(k+1)/2 mod 2.Let&#39;s compute T_k mod 2 for k from 0 to 1 (since mod 2 repeats every 2):k=0: 0*1/2 = 0 mod 2k=1: 1*2/2 = 1 mod 2k=2: 2*3/2 = 3 ≡ 1 mod 2k=3: 3*4/2 = 6 ≡ 0 mod 2k=4: 4*5/2 = 10 ≡ 0 mod 2Wait, but we need to compute T_k mod 2 for k from 0 to ... Wait, the modulus is 2, but k can be up to 2009, but we need to see the pattern.But triangular numbers mod 2 cycle with period 4? Let&#39;s check:k: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...T_k:0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28...T_k mod2:0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0...So the pattern is 0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,... repeating every 4. Wait, but starting at k=0:k=0 mod4: T_k=0 mod2k=1 mod4: T_k=1 mod2k=2 mod4: T_k=3≡1 mod2k=3 mod4: T_k=6≡0 mod2Then k=4 mod4: T_k=10≡0 mod2k=5 mod4=1: T_k=15≡1 mod2So indeed, the cycle is [0,1,1,0] every 4 k&#39;s.Therefore, over k=0 to 2009, how many distinct residues? It alternates between 0,1,1,0,... So, in each block of 4 k&#39;s, we get residues 0,1,1,0. Therefore, the distinct residues mod2 are {0,1}, so N_2=2.Wait, but wait, when k runs from 0 to 2009, does it cover all residues mod4? Let&#39;s see: 2010 people, k from 0 to 2009, which is 2010 terms. 2010 divided by 4 is 502.5, so there are 502 full cycles of 4 and then 2 extra terms. But since we are considering mod2, regardless of the cycle in mod4, the residues mod2 would still be 0 and 1. Because even if the pattern in mod2 is [0,1,1,0], each pair of two k&#39;s gives 0,1, then 1,0. Wait, but over the entire range, even with 2010 terms, the mod2 residues would still be 0 and 1. Let&#39;s confirm:For any k, T_k mod2 is either 0 or 1. Therefore, N_2=2.Wait, but hold on: when k is even, say k=2m, then T_k = (2m)(2m+1)/2 = m(2m+1). If m is even, then m is even, so T_k is even. If m is odd, then m is odd and 2m+1 is odd, so T_k is odd*odd=odd. Wait, but k=2m: T_k = m*(2m+1). So, if m is even, T_k is even. If m is odd, T_k is odd. But when k is odd, k=2m+1, then T_k = (2m+1)(2m+2)/2 = (2m+1)(m+1). If m is even, then m+1 is odd, so T_k is (odd)(odd) = odd. If m is odd, then m+1 is even, so T_k is (odd)(even) = even. Wait, this seems conflicting with earlier. Wait, maybe we need a better approach.Alternatively, notice that T_k = k(k+1)/2. Since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so T_k is always an integer. Now, mod2, T_k = [k(k+1)/2] mod2.If k is even: Let k=2m, then T_k = 2m*(2m+1)/2 = m*(2m+1). Mod2, this is m*1 mod2 = m mod2. So, if m is even, 0; if m is odd, 1.If k is odd: k=2m+1, then T_k = (2m+1)(2m+2)/2 = (2m+1)(m+1). Mod2, (2m+1) is 1 mod2, and (m+1) is (m+1) mod2. So, T_k mod2 = (1)*(m+1 mod2) = (m+1) mod2. If m is even, m+1 is 1; if m is odd, m+1 is 0.Therefore, for even k=2m: T_k ≡ m mod2.For odd k=2m+1: T_k ≡ (m+1) mod2.So, in terms of k:If k ≡0 mod4: Let k=4n, then m=2n, which is even, so T_k ≡0 mod2.If k≡1 mod4: k=4n+1, m=2n, so T_k ≡ (2n +1) mod2 =1 mod2.If k≡2 mod4: k=4n+2, m=2n+1, T_k ≡ (2n+1) mod2 =1 mod2.If k≡3 mod4: k=4n+3, m=2n+1, T_k ≡ (m+1)=2n+2 mod2=0 mod2.So, indeed, T_k mod2 cycles through 0,1,1,0 for k=0,1,2,3 mod4. Therefore, over k=0 to 2009, which includes all residues mod4, the T_k mod2 alternates between 0,1,1,0,... So, the possible residues are 0 and1. Therefore, N_2=2.Now, modulus 3:Compute the number of distinct T_k mod3, where T_k = k(k+1)/2.Similarly, let&#39;s find the possible residues. Since modulus 3 is small, we can list T_k mod3 for k=0,1,2,3,4,5,... to find the pattern.k:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...T_k:0,1,3,6,10,15,21,...T_k mod3:0,1,0,0,1,0,0,...Wait, k=0:0 mod3k=1:1 mod3k=2:3 mod3=0k=3:6 mod3=0k=4:10 mod3=1k=5:15 mod3=0k=6:21 mod3=0k=7:28 mod3=1k=8:36 mod3=0k=9:45 mod3=0So, the pattern seems to be 0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,... repeating every 3? Wait, but let&#39;s check:Wait, for k=0 mod3: Let k=3n. Then T_k = 3n(3n+1)/2. Since 3n and 3n+1 are consecutive, one is even, so 3n(3n+1)/2 is divisible by 3 if n is even? Wait, maybe better to compute T_k mod3:For k ≡0 mod3: Let k=3n. Then T_k = 3n(3n +1)/2. Since k=3n, k+1=3n+1. So, product is 3n(3n+1). Since 3n ≡0 mod3, the product is 0 mod3. Therefore, T_k =0 mod3.Wait, but T_k = [3n(3n+1)]/2. Since either 3n or 3n+1 is even, but 3n is divisible by 3. So, divided by 2, but since 3n is divisible by 3, the entire expression is divisible by 3 only if either 3n or (3n+1)/2 is divisible by 3. Hmm, maybe this approach is not straightforward.Alternatively, compute T_k mod3 for k=0,1,2 mod3:k ≡0 mod3:T_k = 0*1/2 = 0 mod3.k ≡1 mod3:T_k =1*2/2=1 mod3.k ≡2 mod3:T_k =2*3/2=3 ≡0 mod3.So, the residues are: 0,1,0 for k=0,1,2 mod3. Therefore, the pattern repeats every 3 k&#39;s, giving residues 0,1,0. Therefore, the distinct residues mod3 are {0,1}, so N_3=2.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with k=3,4,5:k=3: T_3=6≡0 mod3.k=4: T_4=10≡1 mod3.k=5: T_5=15≡0 mod3.Yes, so the residues are 0,1,0,0,1,0,... So, the distinct residues are 0 and1. So, N_3=2.Wait, but hold on: let me check k=3n+1:k=3n+1:T_k=(3n+1)(3n+2)/2. Let&#39;s compute mod3:(3n+1)(3n+2) ≡1*2=2 mod3. Then divided by 2, so T_k ≡2/2=1 mod3.Similarly, k=3n+2:(3n+2)(3n+3)/2 ≡2*0/2=0 mod3.Therefore, indeed, T_k mod3 is 0 when k≡0 or 2 mod3, and 1 when k≡1 mod3. So, residues mod3 are 0 and1. So, N_3=2.Now modulus5:Compute N_5, the number of distinct T_k mod5. Let&#39;s do similar analysis.T_k =k(k+1)/2 mod5.We can compute T_k for k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 mod5 and see the pattern.k:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9T_k:0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45T_k mod5:0,1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0So, from k=0 to9, the residues mod5 are:0,1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0. So, the pattern seems to repeat every5 k&#39;s? Wait, but k=0-4:0,1,3,1,0; k=5-9:0,1,3,1,0. So, indeed, the pattern repeats every5. So, the residues mod5 cycle every5 k&#39;s as [0,1,3,1,0].Wait, let&#39;s confirm with k=5:k=5: T_5=15≡0 mod5.k=6: T_6=21≡1 mod5.k=7: T_7=28≡3 mod5.k=8: T_8=36≡1 mod5.k=9: T_9=45≡0 mod5.Yes, same as k=0-4. So, the cycle is 0,1,3,1,0 every5 k&#39;s. Therefore, the distinct residues mod5 are 0,1,3. So, N_5=3.Therefore, in modulus5, there are 3 distinct residues.Similarly, let&#39;s check modulus67. That&#39;s going to be more complex. Since 67 is a prime, perhaps we can use some properties of quadratic residues.First, note that T_k =k(k+1)/2. So, 2T_k =k(k+1). Therefore, solving for k given T_k is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation k^2 +k -2T_k ≡0 modp, where p is a prime (like67). Therefore, the number of distinct T_k modp is equal to (p +1)/2 if p is an odd prime? Wait, I need to recall how many quadratic residues there are.Wait, but 2T_k =k(k+1). So, for each residue t modp, the equation k(k+1) ≡2t modp. Let&#39;s let u =k +1/2. Then, k =u -1/2. So, k(k+1) = (u -1/2)(u +1/2) =u^2 -1/4. Therefore, u^2 ≡2t +1/4 modp. Therefore, u^2 ≡(8t +1)/4 modp. So, multiplying both sides by4 (which is invertible modp), 4u^2 ≡8t +1 modp =&gt; 8t ≡4u^2 -1 modp =&gt; t≡(4u^2 -1)/8 modp.Therefore, for each u modp, we can get a t. But since u can be any residue, then the number of distinct t is equal to the number of distinct (4u^2 -1)/8 modp. Since u ranges over all residues, and squaring maps two u&#39;s to the same square, the number of distinct t&#39;s would be (p +1)/2. Wait, but is that correct?Alternatively, since k(k+1) is a quadratic equation, the mapping from k to k(k+1) modp is 2-to-1 except when the discriminant is zero. Therefore, the number of distinct k(k+1)/2 modp would be (p +1)/2.Wait, let me check for small primes:For p=3:Number of distinct T_k mod3: we saw N_3=2. (p+1)/2=2, which matches.For p=5:N_5=3. (5+1)/2=3, which matches.Similarly, for p=2, although 2 is even, (2+1)/2=1.5, which doesn&#39;t make sense, but for odd primes, maybe.Therefore, conjectured that for odd prime p, the number of distinct T_k modp is (p +1)/2. Therefore, for modulus67, the number of distinct residues would be (67+1)/2=34.But let&#39;s verify this with p=5:Number of distinct T_k mod5 is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3, so that works.Therefore, likely, for modulus67, N_67=34.But we need to confirm whether this holds.Alternatively, let&#39;s check the reasoning.We have T_k =k(k+1)/2. So, for each t modp, how many solutions does k(k+1)/2 ≡t modp have?Multiplying both sides by2: k(k+1) ≡2t modp.This is a quadratic equation: k² +k -2t ≡0 modp.The discriminant is 1 +8t modp. Therefore, for each t, the equation has solutions if and only if 1 +8t is a quadratic residue modp. If 1 +8t is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions; if it is zero, one solution; if it is a non-residue, no solution.But how does this relate to the number of distinct t?The number of t such that 1 +8t is a quadratic residue or zero. Since for each quadratic residue (including zero), we can solve for t. So, the number of t&#39;s is equal to the number of quadratic residues (including zero) for 1 +8t.Wait, but this might not be the case. Let&#39;s think differently.Let’s consider that the equation k² +k -2t ≡0 modp. For each k, this equation defines a t. However, since we are counting the number of distinct t&#39;s as k ranges over 0 to p-1. So, each k gives a t=(k² +k)/2 modp. Therefore, the number of distinct t&#39;s is equal to the number of distinct (k² +k)/2 modp. Alternatively, the mapping k → (k² +k)/2 modp. How many distinct images does this mapping have?For each t, the number of preimages is the number of solutions to k² +k -2t ≡0 modp. The equation is quadratic, so each t can have 0,1, or2 preimages. The total number of preimages over all t is p, since each k gives a t. Therefore, the number of t&#39;s with two preimages is (p -1)/2, and the number of t&#39;s with one preimage is1 (if the discriminant is zero for some t). Wait, discriminant is 1 +8t.So, when is the discriminant zero? 1 +8t ≡0 modp ⇒ t≡-1/8 modp.So, there is exactly one t where the discriminant is zero, which would have one solution. The rest of the t&#39;s would have either two solutions or none. However, since the total number of solutions is p (each k gives a t), then the number of t&#39;s with two solutions is (p -1)/2, and one t with one solution. Therefore, total number of distinct t&#39;s is (p -1)/2 +1 = (p +1)/2.Therefore, for an odd prime p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is (p +1)/2.Therefore, for modulus67, N_67= (67 +1)/2=34.Therefore, putting it all together:N_2=2, N_3=2, N_5=3, N_67=34.Therefore, total number of distinct residues modulo2010 is 2*2*3*34= 2*2=4; 4*3=12; 12*34=408.Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.Wait, but wait. Hold on. Let me confirm that the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies here. Since 2010=2*3*5*67, which are pairwise coprime, then the number of distinct residues modulo2010 is indeed the product of the number of residues modulo each prime factor. Therefore, 2*2*3*34=408.But before finalizing, let me check for modulus5 again. Earlier, we saw that the residues mod5 cycle with N_5=3, which is (5+1)/2=3. So that works. For modulus3, (3+1)/2=2, which matches. For modulus2, we saw that there are2 residues, but (2+1)/2=1.5, which isn&#39;t an integer, so the formula doesn&#39;t apply to p=2. But we calculated N_2=2 separately.So, for modulus2, since it&#39;s a prime, but even, we needed to compute separately, and got N_2=2. For odd primes, we used the formula (p +1)/2. So, modulus2 contributes a factor of2, modulus3 contributes2, modulus5 contributes3, modulus67 contributes34. Therefore, total is2*2*3*34=408.But to be thorough, let&#39;s check modulus2 separately.For modulus2, as we saw, T_k mod2 is either0 or1, so two residues, so N_2=2.Therefore, all components:- N_2=2,- N_3=2,- N_5=3,- N_67=34.Multiply them together:2*2=4, 4*3=12, 12*34=408.Therefore, the answer is408.But wait, before accepting, let me check for a small case. Suppose we have modulus6=2*3. Then, using CRT, the number of residues would be N_2*N_3=2*2=4. Let&#39;s verify:Triangular numbers mod6:k:0,1,2,3,4,5,...T_k:0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,...T_k mod6:0,1,3,0,4,3,3,4,0,3,1,...Wait, for k=0 to5:0,1,3,0,4,3.So, distinct residues mod6:0,1,3,4. That&#39;s4, which matches 2*2=4. So, the formula works here.Similarly, modulus10=2*5. Then N_2*N_5=2*3=6. Let&#39;s check:Triangular numbers mod10:k:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...T_k:0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,...T_k mod10:0,1,3,6,0,5,1,8,6,5,...Distinct residues mod10:0,1,3,5,6,8. That&#39;s6, which matches 2*3=6.Therefore, the formula seems valid.Hence, for modulus2010=2*3*5*67, the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo2010 is2*2*3*34=408.Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.Final Answerboxed{408}&lt;/think&gt;Given 2010 people sitting around a round table, we start by giving a candy to person ( x ). Subsequent candies are given to the ( 1 )-st, ( 1+2 )-th, ( 1+2+3 )-th, ..., up to the ( 1+2+cdots+2009 )-th person clockwise from ( x ). We need to find the number of people who get at least one candy.The key is to determine the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010. Triangular numbers are given by ( T_k = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ). We need to find the number of distinct values of ( T_k mod 2010 ) for ( k ) from 0 to 2009.Factorizing 2010, we get ( 2010 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 67 ). Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we compute the number of distinct residues modulo each prime factor and multiply the results:1. Modulo 2: The residues of ( T_k mod 2 ) are 0 and 1, giving 2 distinct residues.2. Modulo 3: The residues of ( T_k mod 3 ) are 0 and 1, giving 2 distinct residues.3. Modulo 5: The residues of ( T_k mod 5 ) are 0, 1, and 3, giving 3 distinct residues.4. Modulo 67: For an odd prime ( p ), the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo ( p ) is ( frac{p+1}{2} ). For ( p = 67 ), this gives ( frac{67+1}{2} = 34 ) distinct residues.Multiplying these results together, we get the total number of distinct residues modulo 2010:[2 times 2 times 3 times 34 = 408]Thus, the number of people who get at least one candy is (boxed{408}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem about 2010 people sitting around a round table. We start by giving a candy to person x. Then, we keep adding numbers: first, we go 1 person clockwise from x and give them a candy, then 1+2=3 people clockwise from x, then 1+2+3=6 people, and so on up to 1+2+...+2009. We need to find out how many people end up getting at least one candy. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving modular arithmetic, maybe some patterns or cycles. Let me try to break it down.First, let me understand the process. We have a circular table with 2010 people. Starting from person x, each subsequent candy is given to the person who is 1, then 1+2, then 1+2+3, etc., positions clockwise. So, the k-th candy (if we start counting from the first one after x) is given to the person at position x + T(k) modulo 2010, where T(k) is the k-th triangular number, T(k) = k(k+1)/2. But wait, in the problem statement, they mention starting from x, then giving to 1st, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc., up to 1+2+...+2009. So actually, the total number of candies given is 2009, because we start counting from 1 up to 2009. But the total number of people is 2010. So, we need to see how many unique positions are covered by these triangular numbers modulo 2010.So the key is to figure out the number of distinct residues modulo 2010 of the triangular numbers T(k) = k(k+1)/2 for k from 1 to 2009. Because each time, we add T(k) to the starting position x, but since it&#39;s a circle, we take modulo 2010. Since the table is circular, all positions are modulo 2010, so the specific starting point x doesn&#39;t matter; it&#39;s just about how the triangular numbers distribute around the modulo 2010.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct values of T(k) = k(k+1)/2 mod 2010 for k = 1, 2, ..., 2009. Then, that number is the answer. So, our task is to compute the size of the set { T(k) mod 2010 | k = 1, 2, ..., 2009 }.First, let&#39;s factorize 2010 to handle the modulus. 2010 factors into 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. So, 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. To find the number of distinct residues modulo 2010, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The idea is that if we can find the number of distinct residues modulo each prime power in the factorization, then multiply them together to get the total number modulo 2010. But 2010 is square-free, so each modulus is a prime: 2, 3, 5, 67. So, if we can compute the number of distinct residues for T(k) modulo 2, 3, 5, and 67 separately, then the total number is the product of these counts.But wait, actually, the CRT says that if we know the residues modulo each of the pairwise coprime moduli, then the system has a unique solution modulo the product. So, if we can find the number of distinct residues modulo each prime factor, and then take the product, that would give the total number of distinct residues modulo 2010. However, this requires that the residues modulo each prime are independent, which they are if the primes are coprime. So, since 2, 3, 5, 67 are all coprime, the total number of residues modulo 2010 is the product of the number of residues modulo each prime.But let&#39;s verify this. For example, suppose for modulus 2, we have a residues, modulus 3, b residues, etc. Then the total number is a*b*c*d. But is this necessarily true? Well, if the mapping from the integers mod 2010 to the product of moduli is bijective (which it is by CRT), then the number of distinct tuples (r2, r3, r5, r67) is equal to the number of distinct residues mod 2010. Therefore, if for each prime modulus, we have certain number of residues, then the total number is the product. Therefore, if we can compute the number of distinct residues of T(k) modulo 2, 3, 5, 67, then multiply them together, that would be the total number. So, that&#39;s the approach.Therefore, let&#39;s compute the number of residues for each modulus:First, modulus 2:Compute T(k) mod 2. T(k) = k(k+1)/2. For modulus 2, let&#39;s see:Note that k(k+1) is always even, so k(k+1)/2 is integer, which is why T(k) is integer. Now, mod 2:If k is even, say k = 2m, then T(k) = 2m(2m + 1)/2 = m(2m + 1). Modulo 2, this is m*(1) mod 2 = m mod 2. So, if k is even, T(k) ≡ m mod 2, where m = k/2.If k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then T(k) = (2m+1)(2m + 2)/2 = (2m+1)(m + 1). Modulo 2, this is (1)(m + 1) mod 2 = (m + 1) mod 2. So, for odd k, T(k) ≡ (m + 1) mod 2, where m = (k - 1)/2.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a simpler pattern. Let&#39;s compute T(k) mod 2 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4:k=1: 1*2/2=1 mod 2 → 1k=2: 2*3/2=3 mod 2 → 1k=3: 3*4/2=6 mod 2 → 0k=4: 4*5/2=10 mod 2 → 0k=5: 5*6/2=15 mod 2 →1k=6:6*7/2=21 mod 2→1k=7:7*8/2=28 mod2→0k=8:8*9/2=36 mod2→0So, the pattern seems to be 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,... repeating every 4 terms. So, period 4.Therefore, residues mod 2 cycle every 4 terms: 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,...So, how many distinct residues? It alternates between 1,1,0,0. So, two residues: 0 and 1. But wait, looking at the sequence, for k=1,2:1; k=3,4:0; k=5,6:1; etc. So, every two terms, the residue alternates between 1 and 0. So, every even k: when k is 1 mod 4 or 2 mod 4, the residue is 1; when k is 3 mod 4 or 0 mod 4, the residue is 0. So, in total, residues mod 2 can be 0 or 1. However, looking at the sequence, the residues cycle between 1,1,0,0. Therefore, over k from 1 to 2009, the number of times residue 1 occurs is for k ≡1,2 mod 4, and residue 0 for k≡3,0 mod4. But since we are counting distinct residues, regardless of how many times they occur, mod2 can only be 0 or1. Therefore, number of distinct residues mod2 is 2.Wait, but let me confirm. Let&#39;s see, for k from 1 to 2009, does T(k) mod2 ever take both 0 and1? Yes, as seen in the first few terms. So, there are 2 residues mod2.Now modulus3:Compute T(k) mod3. Let&#39;s find the pattern.T(k) = k(k+1)/2.Let&#39;s compute T(k) mod3 for k=1 to, say, 6:k=1:1*2/2=1 mod3→1k=2:2*3/2=3 mod3→0k=3:3*4/2=6 mod3→0k=4:4*5/2=10 mod3→1k=5:5*6/2=15 mod3→0k=6:6*7/2=21 mod3→0k=7:7*8/2=28 mod3→1k=8:8*9/2=36 mod3→0So, the pattern is 1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,... repeating every 3 terms? Wait, k=1:1, k=2:0, k=3:0, k=4:1, which is period 3? Wait, 1,0,0,1,0,0,... So period 3. So, every k ≡1 mod3, T(k)≡1 mod3, and for k≡2,0 mod3, T(k)≡0 mod3. Let&#39;s check k=7: 7≡1 mod3, T(k)=28≡1 mod3. Correct. k=8≡2 mod3, T(k)=36≡0 mod3. Correct. So, the residues mod3 are 0 and1. So, number of distinct residues mod3 is 2.Wait, but let&#39;s confirm:For k=1:1, k=2:0, k=3:0, k=4:1 (since k=4≡1 mod3), k=5:0, etc. So, the residues cycle every 3 terms:1,0,0. So, only two residues:0 and1. So, mod3, the number of residues is 2.Mod5:Similarly, compute T(k) mod5. Let&#39;s see. T(k)=k(k+1)/2. Let&#39;s compute for k=1 to 10:k=1:1*2/2=1 mod5→1k=2:2*3/2=3 mod5→3k=3:3*4/2=6 mod5→1k=4:4*5/2=10 mod5→0k=5:5*6/2=15 mod5→0k=6:6*7/2=21 mod5→1k=7:7*8/2=28 mod5→3k=8:8*9/2=36 mod5→1k=9:9*10/2=45 mod5→0k=10:10*11/2=55 mod5→0So, the sequence mod5 is:1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,... So, the pattern repeats every 5 terms? Let&#39;s check:k=11:11*12/2=66 mod5→1k=12:12*13/2=78 mod5→3Yes, so the pattern is 1,3,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,... So, period 5. Therefore, residues mod5 cycle every 5 terms. The residues are 1,3,1,0,0. So, the distinct residues are 0,1,3. Therefore, three residues mod5. So, number of residues mod5 is3.Similarly, modulus67:This is going to be more complicated. Let&#39;s see. For modulus67, we need to find the number of distinct T(k)=k(k+1)/2 mod67 for k=1 to 2009. However, since modulus is 67, and k goes up to 2009, which is much larger than 67, the residues will cycle every certain period. However, perhaps we can find the number of quadratic residues or something else. Alternatively, since 67 is prime, we can analyze the equation T(k) ≡ y mod67 and see for how many y there exists a solution.Alternatively, since we can write 2T(k) ≡k(k+1) mod134 (since modulus67, but 2 and 67 are coprime). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Wait, T(k) =k(k+1)/2 mod67. To find the number of distinct T(k) mod67, note that for each k from 1 to 66, we can compute T(k) mod67, and since after 66, the values will start repeating because k ≡k +67 mod67, but k+1 will be (k+67)+1 ≡k+1 mod67. So, T(k +67)= (k+67)(k+68)/2 ≡k(k+1)/2 +67(2k +68)/2 ≡k(k+1)/2 +67(k +34) mod67. But 67≡0 mod67, so T(k+67)≡T(k) mod67. So, period67. Therefore, the residues of T(k) mod67 repeat every67 terms. Therefore, since we have k from1 to2009, which is 2009=67*30 -1 (since 67*30=2010). Wait, 67*30=2010, so 2009=2010-1=67*30-1. Therefore, the sequence of residues mod67 cycles 30 full times (each of length67) minus1 term. However, since the residues repeat every67, the number of distinct residues mod67 is the same as the number of distinct residues in one period, i.e., from k=1 tok=67. So, we need to compute how many distinct T(k) mod67 exist for k=1 to67.So, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct values of k(k+1)/2 mod67 as k ranges from1 to67.Let me denote T(k) =k(k+1)/2 mod67. We need to find the size of the image of the function T:Z/67Z→Z/67Z.Note that T(k) = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67.We can think of this as a quadratic function. Let&#39;s see if this function is injective or how many collisions it has. Alternatively, we can note that for prime modulus p=67, the equation T(k) = c modp can be rewritten as k^2 +k -2c ≡0 modp. The number of solutions k to this quadratic equation depends on the discriminant. The discriminant D=1 +8c. So, for each c, there are two solutions if D is a quadratic residue modp, one solution if D≡0 modp, and no solutions otherwise. However, since we&#39;re considering k from1 to p=67, but modp, each c can have 0,1, or2 preimages. Therefore, the total number of distinct c is equal to the number of c such that D=1 +8c is a quadratic residue, plus the number of c where D=0, divided appropriately. Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, since the function T(k) = (k^2 +k)/2 modp. Let&#39;s complete the square.Multiply both sides by2: 2T(k) ≡k^2 +k modp.Then, 2T(k) ≡k^2 +k modp.Complete the square:k^2 +k + (1/4) ≡2T(k) +1/4 modp.(k +1/2)^2 ≡2T(k) +1/4 modp.But since p=67, which is ≡3 mod4, 1/2 mod67 is 34 (since 2*34=68≡1 mod67). Therefore, 1/4 mod67 is 34*34=1156≡1156 -17*67=1156-1139=17 mod67.So, (k +34)^2 ≡2T(k) +17 mod67.Thus, rearranged:(k +34)^2 ≡2T(k) +17 mod67.Let me verify that:Start with 2T(k)=k^2 +kAdd 1/4 to both sides: k^2 +k +1/4=2T(k) +1/4Left side is (k +1/2)^2. So, (k +1/2)^2 =2T(k) +1/4.Then, mod67, 1/2=34, so (k +34)^2 ≡2T(k) +17 mod67 (since 1/4=34*34=17 mod67).Therefore, the equation becomes:(k +34)^2 ≡2T(k) +17 mod67.Therefore, for each T(k), there is a corresponding square (k +34)^2 ≡2T(k) +17 mod67. Therefore, 2T(k) +17 must be a quadratic residue mod67, or zero. Therefore, the possible values of T(k) correspond to quadratic residues of the form (k +34)^2 -17 divided by2. Hmm, this seems a bit convoluted, but maybe we can count the number of distinct T(k).Alternatively, note that the mapping from k to T(k) is a quadratic function. The number of distinct values can be calculated as (p +1)/2 if the function is a permutation polynomial or similar. But quadratic functions over finite fields can have different behaviors.Alternatively, since we have a function T(k) = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67, which is a quadratic function. Let&#39;s see how many times each value is taken.For a quadratic function over a finite field, the number of preimages can be 0,1, or2. Therefore, the total number of distinct values is (p -1)/2 +1= (67 -1)/2 +1=34, but this is if the function is a quadratic character. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, consider that the equation y = (k^2 +k)/2 mod67 can be rewritten as k^2 +k -2y ≡0 mod67. For each y, this is a quadratic equation in k. The number of solutions k is determined by the discriminant D=1 +8y. So, D=1 +8y must be a quadratic residue mod67 for there to be solutions. If D is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions; if D=0, one solution; else, no solutions.Therefore, the number of y for which D=1 +8y is a quadratic residue is equal to the number of quadratic residues minus some cases. Wait, but 8 is invertible mod67. Since 8 and67 are coprime, 8 has an inverse mod67. Therefore, the mapping y ↦1 +8y is a bijection. Therefore, the number of y such that 1 +8y is a quadratic residue is equal to the number of quadratic residues. Since in a field of size p=67, there are (p -1)/2=33 quadratic residues (excluding 0). So, if we consider D=1 +8y, then for each quadratic residue D≠0, there is a corresponding y. But we also have D=0 when 1 +8y=0 ⇒y= -1/8= -34*8^{-1}. Wait, but 8^{-1} mod67 is 17, since 8*17=136≡136 -2*67=136 -134=2≡2 mod67. Wait, no. Wait, 8*8=64≡64 mod67, 8*9=72≡5, 8*17=136≡136-2*67=136-134=2. So, 8*17≡2 mod67. Therefore, 8^{-1}≡17*2^{-1} mod67. Since 2^{-1}=34, so 8^{-1}=17*34=578≡578 -8*67=578-536=42 mod67. Let&#39;s check: 8*42=336≡336 -5*67=336-335=1 mod67. Yes, 8*42≡1 mod67. Therefore, 8^{-1}=42 mod67. Therefore, if D=0, then y= -1/8= -42 mod67=25 mod67.Therefore, the equation D=1 +8y=0 ⇒y=25 mod67.So, for y=25, there is exactly one solution k. For other y, if 1 +8y is a quadratic residue, there are two solutions. Otherwise, no solutions.Therefore, the total number of y with solutions is the number of quadratic residues (33) times 2 (since each gives two solutions) plus 1 (for y=25). But since each quadratic residue D gives two solutions for k, but how does that relate to y?Wait, perhaps I need to be careful. For each quadratic residue D, we have two solutions k. Each such D corresponds to a unique y=(D -1)/8. Therefore, each quadratic residue D corresponds to one y, which has two solutions k. Therefore, the number of y such that there are two solutions is equal to the number of quadratic residues D=1 +8y, which is the same as the number of quadratic residues, which is33. Thus, these 33 values of y each have two solutions k, contributing 33*2=66 solutions. Then, y=25 has one solution. So, total solutions:66 +1=67, which matches the total number of k from1 to67.Therefore, the number of distinct y is 33 (from quadratic residues) +1 (from y=25) =34. However, wait, because each quadratic residue D≠0 gives a unique y=(D -1)/8, so 33 different y&#39;s with two k&#39;s each, and y=25 has one k. Therefore, the total number of distinct y&#39;s is33 +1=34. Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod67 is34.Wait, but let&#39;s verify. For each quadratic residue D, which there are33 non-zero, each gives a unique y=(D -1)/8. So, each of these y&#39;s is distinct, because if two different D&#39;s gave the same y, then (D1 -1)/8≡(D2 -1)/8 mod67 ⇒D1≡D2 mod67. So, since D&#39;s are distinct quadratic residues, the y&#39;s are distinct. Then, y=25 is another distinct value. Therefore, total distinct y&#39;s=33 +1=34.Therefore, the number of distinct residues mod67 is34.Therefore, combining all together, the number of distinct residues modulo2010 is the product of the number of residues modulo2,3,5,67. Which is2*2*3*34=2*2=4; 4*3=12; 12*34=408.But wait, hold on. Let me check again. Mod2:2 residues, mod3:2 residues, mod5:3 residues, mod67:34 residues. So, total residues=2*2*3*34. Let me compute this step by step:First, 2*2=4.4*3=12.12*34=408.Therefore, the total number of distinct residues modulo2010 is408. Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.But wait, hold on. Let me check if this logic is correct. The problem is that when using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the mapping is unique. So, if for each modulus, the residues are independent, then the total number is the product. But is this the case here?Wait, suppose that for modulus2, the residues are0 and1; for modulus3, 0 and1; for modulus5,0,1,3; for modulus67, 0,1,...,34. However, when combining via CRT, the combination is unique. So, if for each prime modulus, the set of residues are independent, then the total number is indeed the product. However, this assumes that the residues in each modulus are independent. But in reality, the residues are not independent because the original numbers are triangular numbers, so the residues in different moduli are linked by the value of k. However, in our approach, we calculated the number of distinct residues for each modulus separately, then multiplied them together. However, this is only valid if the residues in different moduli are independent. But in reality, they are not necessarily independent, because the same k that gives a residue mod2 may affect the residue mod3, etc. However, since we are considering the total number of residues modulo2010, which factors into coprime moduli, the Chinese Remainder Theorem ensures that the number of residues modulo2010 is equal to the product of the number of residues modulo each prime factor. However, this is only true if the residues modulo each prime are independent. But actually, no, that is not necessarily the case. Wait, actually, the CRT says that the residues mod2, mod3, mod5, mod67 uniquely determine the residue mod2010. Therefore, the total number of distinct residues mod2010 is equal to the number of distinct tuples (r2, r3, r5, r67), where r2 is a residue mod2, r3 mod3, etc., that can be achieved by T(k). Therefore, the total number is the product of the number of residues in each modulus only if for each modulus, the achievable residues are independent of the others. However, this is not the case here, because the residues in different moduli are determined by the same k. Therefore, the mapping from k to (r2, r3, r5, r67) may not be surjective onto the product of the individual residue sets. Therefore, the total number of residues mod2010 could be less than the product.Therefore, my initial approach may be incorrect. So, maybe I need a different method.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is indeed 408, but I need to verify this.Wait, but let&#39;s think of a smaller example. Suppose we have modulus6=2*3. Let&#39;s compute the number of distinct triangular numbers mod6.Compute T(k)=k(k+1)/2 mod6 for k=1 to6:k=1:1*2/2=1 mod6→1k=2:2*3/2=3 mod6→3k=3:3*4/2=6 mod6→0k=4:4*5/2=10 mod6→4k=5:5*6/2=15 mod6→3k=6:6*7/2=21 mod6→3So, residues mod6:1,3,0,4,3,3. So, distinct residues:0,1,3,4. So,4 residues. Now, according to our previous method, compute residues mod2 and mod3.For modulus2: residues are0,1. So,2 residues.For modulus3: residues are0,1. So,2 residues.Product:2*2=4, which matches the actual count. So, in this case, the product gives the correct answer. So, maybe in the case of square-free modulus, the total number of residues is the product of the number of residues for each prime modulus. Therefore, perhaps the same applies to modulus2010. Therefore, the answer is indeed408.But let&#39;s test another modulus. Let&#39;s take modulus30=2*3*5.Compute the number of triangular numbers mod30. But this might be tedious, but let&#39;s see:Alternatively, we can check modulus30. If according to the previous method, compute residues mod2:2, mod3:2, mod5:3. Product=2*2*3=12. Let&#39;s see if actual residues mod30 are12.But calculating all T(k) mod30 for k=1 to30 would take time, but perhaps we can compute some. Alternatively, note that if modulus is composite, the number of residues can be the product if the individual residues are independent. Since in the case of modulus6, it worked. So, perhaps it&#39;s safe to assume that for square-free modulus, the number of residues is the product of the number of residues for each prime factor. Therefore, the answer is408.But let me check modulus5 and modulus3 again.Wait, earlier for modulus3, the residues were0,1. For modulus5, residues were0,1,3. If we take modulus15=3*5, then according to our method, number of residues would be2*3=6. Let&#39;s check:Compute T(k) mod15 for k=1 to15:k=1:1 mod15→1k=2:3 mod15→3k=3:6 mod15→6k=4:10 mod15→10k=5:15 mod15→0k=6:21 mod15→6k=7:28 mod15→13k=8:36 mod15→6k=9:45 mod15→0k=10:55 mod15→10k=11:66 mod15→6k=12:78 mod15→3k=13:91 mod15→1k=14:105 mod15→0k=15:120 mod15→0So, the residues are:1,3,6,10,0,6,13,6,0,10,6,3,1,0,0. Distinct residues:0,1,3,6,10,13. So,6 residues. Which matches 2*3=6. Therefore, the product gives the correct answer. Therefore, it seems the approach is valid.Therefore, returning to the original problem, the number of residues modulo2010 is2*2*3*34=408. Therefore, the answer is408.But just to confirm, since the starting person is x, and we are moving T(k) positions from x, modulo2010. Therefore, the number of unique positions is equal to the number of unique T(k) mod2010. Therefore, the answer is408.However, let me check with modulus67. I had calculated34 residues mod67. Let me confirm this with an example. Take a smaller prime, say p=7.Compute T(k)=k(k+1)/2 mod7 for k=1 to7:k=1:1 mod7k=2:3 mod7k=3:6 mod7k=4:10≡3 mod7k=5:15≡1 mod7k=6:21≡0 mod7k=7:28≡0 mod7So, residues:1,3,6,3,1,0,0. Distinct residues:0,1,3,6. So,4 residues. Now, according to our previous method, modulus7, which is prime.The number of residues should be (7 +1)/2=4. Which matches. So, for p=7, we have4 residues. Similarly, for p=67, we get34 residues, which is(67 +1)/2=34. Therefore, the formula is for prime modulus p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is(p +1)/2. Wait, so if p is an odd prime, then the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is(p +1)/2. Let me verify this.For p=3:k=1:1, k=2:3≡0, k=3:6≡0. So residues:0,1. (3 +1)/2=2. Correct.For p=5:k=1:1, k=2:3, k=3:6≡1, k=4:10≡0, k=5:15≡0. Residues:0,1,3. (5 +1)/2=3. Correct.For p=7:4 residues, (7 +1)/2=4. Correct.So, general formula: For an odd prime p, the number of distinct triangular numbers modp is(p +1)/2.Therefore, for p=67, the number is(67 +1)/2=34. Which matches our earlier calculation.Therefore, the number of residues modulo a prime p is(p +1)/2. Therefore, for modulus2, we saw there are2 residues, which is(2 +1)/2=1.5, but since p=2 is even, this formula doesn&#39;t apply. For modulus2, as we saw, there are2 residues.But for odd primes, the formula holds. So, modulus3:2 residues=(3 +1)/2=2. Correct.Therefore, to generalize:For modulus2: number of residues=2.For each odd prime modulus p: number of residues=(p +1)/2.Therefore, combining these for modulus2010=2*3*5*67, the total number of residues is2*( (3 +1)/2)*( (5 +1)/2)*( (67 +1)/2 )=2*2*3*34=408. Which matches our previous result.Therefore, the number of people who get at least one candy is408.Thus, the final answer is boxed{408}.Final Answerboxed{408}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of determining the number of people who get at least one candy among 2010 people sitting around a round table, we need to find the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo 2010. The key steps are as follows:1. Factorize 2010: The modulus 2010 factors into prime components (2010 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 67).2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem: The number of distinct residues modulo 2010 can be found by determining the number of distinct residues modulo each prime factor and then multiplying these counts together.3. Calculate residues for each prime modulus:   - Modulo 2: The triangular numbers (T(k) = frac{k(k+1)}{2}) modulo 2 cycle every 4 terms, yielding residues 0 and 1. Thus, there are 2 distinct residues.   - Modulo 3: The triangular numbers modulo 3 cycle every 3 terms, yielding residues 0 and 1. Thus, there are 2 distinct residues.   - Modulo 5: The triangular numbers modulo 5 cycle every 5 terms, yielding residues 0, 1, and 3. Thus, there are 3 distinct residues.   - Modulo 67: For an odd prime (p), the number of distinct triangular numbers modulo (p) is (frac{p + 1}{2}). For (p = 67), this gives (frac{67 + 1}{2} = 34) distinct residues.4. Combine results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Multiply the number of distinct residues for each prime factor:   [   2 times 2 times 3 times 34 = 408   ]Thus, the number of people who get at least one candy is (boxed{408}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8995579a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>🔑:</span>1. Define the problem in terms of modular arithmetic:   We need to find the number of distinct values of (frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{2010}) for (0 leq k leq 2009). This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the set (S = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{2010} mid 0 leq k leq 2009 right}).2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem:   Since (2010 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 67), we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to break the problem into smaller parts. Specifically, we need to find the cardinalities of the sets (S_p = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{p} mid 0 leq k leq p-1 right}) for each prime (p) dividing (2010).3. Calculate for (p = 2):   [   S_2 = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{2} mid 0 leq k leq 1 right}   ]   For (k = 0), (frac{0(0+1)}{2} = 0).   For (k = 1), (frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1).   Thus, (S_2 = {0, 1}) and (|S_2| = 2).4. Calculate for (p = 3):   [   S_3 = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{3} mid 0 leq k leq 2 right}   ]   For (k = 0), (frac{0(0+1)}{2} = 0).   For (k = 1), (frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1).   For (k = 2), (frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 3 equiv 0 pmod{3}).   Thus, (S_3 = {0, 1}) and (|S_3| = 2).5. Calculate for (p = 5):   [   S_5 = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{5} mid 0 leq k leq 4 right}   ]   For (k = 0), (frac{0(0+1)}{2} = 0).   For (k = 1), (frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1).   For (k = 2), (frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 3).   For (k = 3), (frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6 equiv 1 pmod{5}).   For (k = 4), (frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10 equiv 0 pmod{5}).   Thus, (S_5 = {0, 1, 3}) and (|S_5| = 3).6. Calculate for (p = 67):   [   S_{67} = left{ frac{k(k+1)}{2} pmod{67} mid 0 leq k leq 66 right}   ]   For (p &gt; 2), (frac{k(k+1)}{2} = frac{(2k+1)^2 - 1}{8}). The number of distinct values modulo (p) is the number of quadratic residues modulo (p), which is (frac{p+1}{2}).   Thus, (|S_{67}| = frac{67+1}{2} = 34).7.

So, we have three positive integers a, b, c forming an arithmetic sequence with a &lt; b &lt; c. That means b - a = c - b, so 2b = a + c. Got that part. Then there&#39;s a quadratic function f(x) = a x² + b x + c. We have two distinct real numbers r and s such that f(r) = s and f(s) = r. Also, rs = 2017. We need to find the smallest possible value of a.Hmm. Let&#39;s start by writing down the given equations. Since f(r) = s and f(s) = r, that gives us:1. a r² + b r + c = s2. a s² + b s + c = rAnd we know that r and s are distinct real numbers with rs = 2017.Since r and s are roots of some sort of equation, maybe we can subtract the two equations to eliminate c? Let&#39;s try subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:a r² + b r + c - (a s² + b s + c) = s - rSimplifying that:a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) = s - rFactor the left side:a(r - s)(r + s) + b(r - s) = - (r - s)Since r ≠ s (they are distinct), we can divide both sides by (r - s):a(r + s) + b = -1So that gives us the equation:a(r + s) + b = -1  ...(3)Interesting. So we have a relation involving a, b, r, and s. Also, we know that rs = 2017. Maybe we can express r + s in terms of something else? Let&#39;s see.Another thought: Let&#39;s consider the two equations f(r) = s and f(s) = r. If we plug s into f, we get r. So maybe we can set up the system and try to eliminate variables?Alternatively, think of f(f(r)) = r? Because f(r) = s, then f(s) = r, so applying f twice brings us back to r. So perhaps r is a fixed point of the function f(f(x)). But since r and s are distinct, they form a 2-cycle.But maybe that&#39;s complicating things. Let&#39;s stick to the equations we have.From equation (3): a(r + s) + b = -1. Also, from the arithmetic sequence, we know 2b = a + c. So maybe we can express c in terms of a and b: c = 2b - a.So the function becomes f(x) = a x² + b x + (2b - a).We can substitute this into equations 1 and 2:1. a r² + b r + (2b - a) = s2. a s² + b s + (2b - a) = rLet me write these again:Equation 1: a r² + b r + 2b - a = sEquation 2: a s² + b s + 2b - a = rLet me rearrange both equations to group terms with a and b:From equation 1:a(r² - 1) + b(r + 2) = sFrom equation 2:a(s² - 1) + b(s + 2) = rSo now we have two equations:Equation 1&#39;: a(r² - 1) + b(r + 2) = sEquation 2&#39;: a(s² - 1) + b(s + 2) = rHmm. Let&#39;s consider these as two linear equations in variables a and b. Maybe we can solve for a and b.Let me denote:Let’s write them as:1. [r² - 1] a + [r + 2] b = s2. [s² - 1] a + [s + 2] b = rThis is a system of linear equations in a and b. To solve for a and b, we can use Cramer&#39;s rule or elimination. Let&#39;s try elimination.Multiply equation 1 by (s + 2):[r² - 1](s + 2) a + [r + 2](s + 2) b = s(s + 2)Multiply equation 2 by (r + 2):[s² - 1](r + 2) a + [s + 2](r + 2) b = r(r + 2)Now subtract the two equations to eliminate b:[ (r² - 1)(s + 2) - (s² - 1)(r + 2) ] a = s(s + 2) - r(r + 2)Let me compute the left side:First term: (r² - 1)(s + 2) = r² s + 2 r² - s - 2Second term: (s² - 1)(r + 2) = s² r + 2 s² - r - 2Subtracting second term from the first term:[ r² s + 2 r² - s - 2 ] - [ s² r + 2 s² - r - 2 ] =r² s - s² r + 2 r² - 2 s² - s + r + (-2 + 2)Simplify:rs(r - s) + 2(r² - s²) + (r - s)Factor terms:= rs(r - s) + 2(r - s)(r + s) + (r - s)Factor out (r - s):= (r - s)[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ]So the left side is (r - s)[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] aRight side:s(s + 2) - r(r + 2) = s² + 2s - r² - 2r = (s² - r²) + 2(s - r) = (s - r)(s + r) + 2(s - r) = (s - r)(s + r + 2)Thus, combining both sides:(r - s)[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] a = (s - r)(s + r + 2 )Note that (r - s) = -(s - r), so:- (s - r)[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] a = (s - r)(s + r + 2 )Divide both sides by (s - r):- [ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] a = (s + r + 2 )Multiply both sides by -1:[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] a = - (s + r + 2 )So,a = - (s + r + 2 ) / [ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ]But we know that rs = 2017. Let&#39;s substitute that in:a = - (s + r + 2 ) / [ 2017 + 2(r + s) + 1 ]Simplify denominator:2017 + 1 + 2(r + s) = 2018 + 2(r + s)So,a = - (r + s + 2 ) / [ 2018 + 2(r + s) ]Let’s denote t = r + s. Then:a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t )But a has to be a positive integer, so this fraction must be negative and reduce to a positive integer. However, the numerator is -(t + 2) and denominator is (2018 + 2t). Since a is positive, the numerator and denominator must be of opposite signs. Let&#39;s see.Since a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t ) is positive, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. So:Either:- (t + 2) &gt; 0 and (2018 + 2t) &lt; 0, which would require t + 2 &lt; 0 and 2018 + 2t &lt; 0. But 2018 + 2t &lt; 0 implies t &lt; -1009. But r and s are real numbers with rs = 2017. If both r and s are negative, then their product is positive, which is 2017. So maybe t = r + s could be negative? Let&#39;s check. If r and s are both negative, their product is positive (2017) and their sum is negative. So t = r + s is negative. So maybe possible.Alternatively, the other case is - (t + 2) &lt; 0 and (2018 + 2t) &gt; 0. But this would lead to a negative value of a, which is not allowed. So only the first case is possible: t + 2 &lt; 0 and 2018 + 2t &lt; 0. But let&#39;s see:t + 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; t &lt; -22018 + 2t &lt; 0 =&gt; 2t &lt; -2018 =&gt; t &lt; -1009So t must be less than -1009. So r + s = t &lt; -1009. But since rs = 2017, and r and s are both negative, let&#39;s denote r = -p, s = -q, where p and q are positive real numbers. Then rs = (-p)(-q) = pq = 2017, and r + s = - (p + q ) = t &lt; -1009. Therefore, p + q &gt; 1009.So, with p and q positive, pq = 2017, p + q &gt; 1009. Hmm. But 2017 is a prime number, right? Let me check. 2017 divided by primes: 2017 ÷ 2 is not, 2017 ÷ 3 is 672.333…, not integer. 2017 ÷ 5 is 403.4, nope. 2017 ÷ 7 is 288.142… nope. 11? 2017 ÷11=183.363… nope. 13? 155.15… nope. 17? 2017 ÷17≈118.647. Hmm. So 2017 is a prime. So the only positive integer factors are 1 and 2017.But p and q don&#39;t have to be integers, just positive reals. However, for the purpose of the problem, we need a, b, c to be positive integers, but r and s can be any real numbers. So even though rs = 2017, a prime, r and s don&#39;t have to be integers. So p and q could be any positive reals such that pq = 2017 and p + q &gt; 1009.But how does this help us? Let me get back to the expression for a:a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t )But t = r + s = - (p + q ), so:a = - ( - (p + q ) + 2 ) / (2018 + 2*(- (p + q )) )Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: - ( - (p + q ) + 2 ) = - ( -p - q + 2 ) = p + q - 2Denominator: 2018 - 2(p + q )So,a = (p + q - 2) / (2018 - 2(p + q )) Let me let S = p + q. Then since pq = 2017, and p and q are positive reals, S &gt;= 2*sqrt(pq) = 2*sqrt(2017) ≈ 2*44.92 ≈ 89.84. But since p + q &gt; 1009, as we saw earlier, S &gt; 1009.Thus, a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S )But S &gt; 1009, so denominator 2018 - 2S = 2(1009 - S ) + 0? Wait, 2018 - 2S = 2018 - 2S. Since S &gt; 1009, 2S &gt; 2018, so denominator is negative. The numerator is S - 2, which is also positive (since S &gt; 1009), so a is positive, as required.So, a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ) = (S - 2)/(- (2S - 2018 )) = - (S - 2)/(2S - 2018 ) = (2 - S )/(2S - 2018 )But maybe we can write a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ) = (S - 2)/(- (2S - 2018 )) = - (S - 2)/(2S - 2018 )But a must be a positive integer. So (S - 2) must be divisible by (2S - 2018 ), and the quotient must be negative. But since S &gt; 1009, 2S - 2018 is positive, so (S - 2) must be negative, which is impossible because S &gt; 1009. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, S = p + q &gt; 1009, so S - 2 is definitely positive, and 2018 - 2S is negative (as 2S &gt; 2018). So the ratio (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ) is (positive)/(negative) = negative. But a is supposed to be a positive integer. So there must be an error here.Wait, wait, no. Wait, earlier, we had:a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t )But t = r + s &lt; -1009, as we established. So t is a negative number less than -1009. Then t + 2 is also negative (since t &lt; -1009, t + 2 &lt; -1007). So the numerator is - (t + 2 ) which is positive. The denominator 2018 + 2t: since t &lt; -1009, 2t &lt; -2018, so 2018 + 2t &lt; 0. So denominator is negative. Therefore, a is positive, as it&#39;s a positive divided by negative, but with the negative sign outside. Wait, let&#39;s see:Wait, a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t )t + 2 is negative (since t &lt; -1009), so -(t + 2) is positive.Denominator: 2018 + 2t. Since t &lt; -1009, 2t &lt; -2018, so 2018 + 2t &lt; 0.Therefore, a = positive / negative = negative. But a has to be positive. Contradiction. Wait, this can&#39;t be. There must be a mistake in the algebra.Wait, let me retrace. From the equation:[ rs + 2(r + s) + 1 ] a = - (r + s + 2 )So,a = - (r + s + 2 ) / [ rs + 2(r + s ) + 1 ]Given rs = 2017, so:a = - (r + s + 2 ) / [ 2017 + 2(r + s ) + 1 ] = - (r + s + 2 ) / [ 2018 + 2(r + s ) ]So, a = - (r + s + 2 ) / (2018 + 2(r + s ) )Let me denote t = r + s. Then:a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t )But since r and s are real numbers with rs = 2017, and they are distinct. So the quadratic equation x² - t x + 2017 = 0 has two distinct real roots, so discriminant t² - 4*2017 &gt; 0. So t² &gt; 8068. So |t| &gt; sqrt(8068) ≈ 89.83. But since t = r + s. If r and s are both positive, then t &gt; 0, but then rs = 2017. However, in our earlier analysis, we saw that t must be less than -1009. Wait, how?Wait, if r and s are both positive, then t = r + s is positive. But then in the expression for a, a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t ). Since t is positive, numerator is negative, denominator is positive, so a would be negative. But a must be positive. Therefore, r and s cannot be both positive. Therefore, they must be both negative. Therefore, t = r + s is negative, and since rs = 2017 (positive), that&#39;s consistent.So t is negative, and |t| &gt; sqrt(8068) ≈ 89.83. Therefore, t &lt; -sqrt(8068) ≈ -89.83. But from earlier, we saw that t must be less than -1009. Wait, why? Wait, no. Wait, when we considered equation (3):a(r + s) + b = -1Since a and b are positive integers, the left side is a(r + s) + b. But if t = r + s is negative, then a(r + s) is negative. So we have a negative number plus b equals -1. Since b is a positive integer, this requires that a(r + s) is a negative integer such that when added to b, gives -1. So, a(r + s) = - (b + 1 )But a and b are positive integers, so a(r + s) must be a negative integer less than or equal to -2 (since b &gt;= 1). So:a(r + s ) = - (b + 1 )But we also know from the arithmetic sequence that 2b = a + c, and since c = 2b - a, c is positive, so 2b - a &gt; 0 =&gt; a &lt; 2b. So b &gt; a / 2.Therefore, combining with a(r + s) = - (b + 1 ), since a(r + s) is negative, as a is positive and r + s is negative. So:b + 1 = - a(r + s )But let&#39;s express this in terms of t:b + 1 = - a tBut we already have from equation (3):a t + b = -1 =&gt; b = -1 - a tSubstitute into b + 1 = - a t:(-1 - a t ) + 1 = - a t =&gt; - a t = - a t. So it&#39;s consistent. So that&#39;s not giving us new information.Wait, perhaps we need another equation. Let&#39;s recall that from the system earlier:We had equation (3): a t + b = -1We also have from the arithmetic sequence: 2b = a + c =&gt; c = 2b - a.Additionally, from equation 1: a r² + b r + c = sBut c = 2b - a, so equation 1: a r² + b r + 2b - a = sSimilarly, equation 2: a s² + b s + 2b - a = rAlternatively, perhaps express s from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.From equation 1: s = a r² + b r + 2b - aFrom equation 2: r = a s² + b s + 2b - aSo substituting s from equation 1 into equation 2:r = a [a r² + b r + 2b - a]^2 + b [a r² + b r + 2b - a] + 2b - aThis seems very complicated, but maybe we can find a relation here. However, this might be too messy. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that rs = 2017, so s = 2017 / r. Then we can express everything in terms of r.Let me try that. Let s = 2017 / r. Then, since r and s are distinct, r ≠ 2017/r, so r² ≠ 2017.From equation (3): a(r + s) + b = -1. Substituting s = 2017 / r:a(r + 2017/r) + b = -1Also, from equation 1: a r² + b r + c = s = 2017 / r. And c = 2b - a. So:a r² + b r + 2b - a = 2017 / rMultiply both sides by r to eliminate denominator:a r³ + b r² + (2b - a) r = 2017Similarly, from equation 2: a s² + b s + 2b - a = r. Substitute s = 2017 / r:a (2017 / r)^2 + b (2017 / r ) + 2b - a = rMultiply both sides by r² to eliminate denominators:a (2017)^2 + b (2017) r + (2b - a) r² = r³So now we have two equations:1. a r³ + b r² + (2b - a) r - 2017 = 02. - r³ + (2b - a) r² + 2017 b r + 2017² a = 0This seems very complicated. Maybe there is a better approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the fact that a(r + s) + b = -1. Since s = 2017 / r, we can write:a(r + 2017/r) + b = -1From the arithmetic sequence, 2b = a + c =&gt; c = 2b - a. So c is determined once a and b are known.We need to find positive integers a, b, c with a &lt; b &lt; c and 2b = a + c, and such that there exist real numbers r and s with rs = 2017, f(r) = s, f(s) = r.But maybe we can express b in terms of a from the equation a(r + s) + b = -1.From that equation:b = -1 - a(r + s )But r + s = t, which we know is negative. Let&#39;s substitute s = 2017 / r:t = r + 2017 / rSo, b = -1 - a(r + 2017 / r )But b must be a positive integer. Since a is positive and r + 2017 / r is negative (as r is negative), then -a(r + 2017 / r ) is positive, so b = -1 + [positive number]. Therefore, the positive number must be at least 2 to make b positive. So:- a(r + 2017 / r ) - 1 &gt;= 1 =&gt; - a(r + 2017 / r ) &gt;= 2 =&gt; a(r + 2017 / r ) &lt;= -2But since r is negative, let&#39;s set r = -k, where k is a positive real number. Then s = 2017 / r = -2017 / k.Thus, t = r + s = -k - 2017/kSo, t = - (k + 2017 /k )Thus, from equation (3):a*(- (k + 2017 /k )) + b = -1 =&gt; -a(k + 2017/k ) + b = -1 =&gt; b = a(k + 2017/k ) -1Also, b must be a positive integer, so:a(k + 2017/k ) -1 &gt; 0 =&gt; a(k + 2017/k ) &gt; 1Also, from the arithmetic sequence condition, 2b = a + c =&gt; c = 2b - a. Since c must be greater than b, we have 2b - a &gt; b =&gt; b &gt; a. So b = a(k + 2017/k ) -1 &gt; a =&gt; a(k + 2017/k ) -1 &gt; a =&gt; a(k + 2017/k -1 ) &gt;1Given that a is a positive integer, this inequality must hold.But this is getting quite abstract. Maybe we can express everything in terms of a and k, then try to find integer solutions.Given that b = a(k + 2017/k ) -1, and c = 2b -a = 2[ a(k + 2017/k ) -1 ] -a = 2a(k + 2017/k ) -2 -a = a(2(k + 2017/k ) -1 ) -2All of a, b, c need to be positive integers. Also, since a &lt; b &lt; c, we have:a &lt; a(k + 2017/k ) -1 &lt; a(2(k + 2017/k ) -1 ) -2But k is a positive real number (since r = -k &lt;0). Let&#39;s see if we can find some relationship here.Alternatively, since k is positive, and the expressions involve k + 2017/k, which has a minimum value by AM-GM. The minimum of k + 2017/k is 2*sqrt(2017) ≈ 89.83. So k + 2017/k &gt;= 89.83, which occurs when k = sqrt(2017). So regardless of k, this term is at least about 89.83.But since a(k + 2017/k ) -1 is b, and b must be an integer greater than a. Therefore, a(k + 2017/k ) -1 must be an integer, and greater than a. Hence, a(k + 2017/k ) -1 &gt; a =&gt; a(k + 2017/k -1 ) &gt;1. Given that k + 2017/k is at least ~89.83, even for a=1, we have 1*(89.83 -1 ) ~88.83 &gt;1, which is true. So for any a&gt;=1, this inequality is satisfied.But the key point is that b must be an integer. So, since b = a(k + 2017/k ) -1 must be an integer, and k is a real number. However, k is related to r and s, which are roots of the equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r, but since we are looking for integral a, b, c, maybe k must be chosen such that k + 2017/k is rational? Or more specifically, (k + 2017/k ) must be a rational number since a(k + 2017/k ) -1 is an integer. Let&#39;s see.Let’s denote m = k + 2017/k. Then, m is a real number greater than or equal to 2*sqrt(2017). Since k is positive. Then, b = a*m -1 must be integer. Also, m must satisfy some conditions. Let’s consider m.Since m = k + 2017/k, we can write this as k² - m k + 2017 =0. The solutions are k = [m ± sqrt(m² - 4*2017 )]/2. For k to be real, m² &gt;= 4*2017, which is consistent with AM-GM.But how does this help? Maybe if m is rational, then sqrt(m² - 80568) must also be rational. Therefore, m² - 80568 must be a perfect square. Let me check:Wait, 4*2017 = 8068, not 80568. So m² &gt;= 8068. So m² - 8068 must be a perfect square. Let&#39;s denote D = m² - 8068. Then D must be a perfect square. So, m² - D = 8068, where D is a perfect square.So, m and sqrt(D) are integers (if m is rational and D is a perfect square). Wait, but m is equal to k + 2017/k. If m is rational, then k is a solution to k² - m k + 2017 =0. If m is rational, then k would be [m ± sqrt(m² - 8068 )]/2. For k to be real, sqrt(m² -8068 ) must be real, so m² &gt;= 8068.But even if m is rational, unless m² -8068 is a perfect square, k would be irrational. However, for a(k + 2017/k ) -1 = b to be integer, with a and b integers, maybe m must be rational. Let me see:Suppose that m = p/q, a reduced fraction. Then:b = a*(p/q ) -1 must be integer. So (a p / q ) -1 is integer =&gt; a p / q must be integer plus 1. So q divides a p. If a and q are coprime, then q divides p. But since m = p/q is in lowest terms, this would require q=1. Therefore, m must be an integer. Wait, but m = k + 2017/k. Unless k and 2017/k are both rational, which would require that k is a rational multiple of sqrt(2017). But 2017 is prime, so sqrt(2017) is irrational. So unless k = sqrt(2017), but then m = 2 sqrt(2017), which is irrational.Therefore, unless m is an integer, but even then, k would be irrational unless m² - 8068 is a perfect square. So, perhaps m must be an integer such that m² - 8068 is a perfect square. Let’s suppose that m is an integer. Then m² - y² = 8068, where y is integer. So (m - y)(m + y) = 8068.So, we need two integers m - y and m + y such that their product is 8068, and m - y &lt; m + y, both positive (since m &gt; y &gt;=0). Let&#39;s factorize 8068:8068 ÷ 2 = 40344034 ÷ 2 = 20172017 is prime. So 8068 = 2² * 2017So the positive divisors of 8068 are: 1, 2, 4, 2017, 4034, 8068So, the pairs (m - y, m + y ) are:(1, 8068): m - y =1, m + y=8068. Then adding: 2m =8069 =&gt; m=8069/2=4034.5 Not integer.(2, 4034): m - y=2, m + y=4034. Adding: 2m=4036 =&gt; m=2018. Then y= (4034 - 2)/2=2016Check m² - y²=2018² -2016²= (2018-2016)(2018+2016)=2*4034=8068. Correct.Next pair: (4, 2017). m - y=4, m + y=2017. Adding: 2m=2021 =&gt; m=2021/2=1010.5 Not integer.So only the pair (2,4034) gives integer solutions m=2018, y=2016.Thus, the only possible integer m is 2018, with y=2016. Therefore, m=2018.Thus, m=2018 implies that k +2017/k =2018. Then, solving for k:k +2017/k=2018 =&gt; k² -2018 k +2017=0 =&gt; k=(2018 ±sqrt(2018² -4*1*2017))/2Compute discriminant:2018² - 4*2017=2018² -8068But 2018² = (2000 +18)^2=2000² +2*2000*18 +18²=4,000,000 +72,000 +324=4,072,324Thus, 4,072,324 -8,068=4,064,256. sqrt(4,064,256)=2016Therefore, k=(2018 ±2016)/2Thus, k=(2018+2016)/2=4034/2=2017 or k=(2018-2016)/2=2/2=1But k is positive, so k=2017 or k=1. But k was defined as r = -k. So s = -2017/k. If k=2017, then s = -2017/2017=-1. So r=-2017, s=-1. Alternatively, if k=1, then r=-1, s=-2017. Either way, the pairs are (-2017, -1) and (-1, -2017).So this gives us specific values for r and s: either (-2017, -1) or (-1, -2017).Now, with m=2018, we can compute b.From earlier, b = a*m -1=2018 a -1.Also, from the arithmetic sequence, c=2b -a=2*(2018 a -1 ) -a=4036 a -2 -a=4035 a -2.Therefore, a, b=2018 a -1, c=4035 a -2 must be positive integers with a &lt; b &lt; c.Check if a &lt; b:a &lt; 2018 a -1 =&gt; 0 &lt;2017 a -1 =&gt;2017 a &gt;1. Since a is a positive integer, this holds for a &gt;=1.Check if b &lt;c:2018 a -1 &lt;4035 a -2 =&gt; -1 +2 &lt;4035 a -2018 a =&gt;1 &lt;2017 a =&gt;a &gt;1/2017. Since a is a positive integer, this holds for a&gt;=1.Therefore, for any a&gt;=1, a &lt; b &lt;c. But we need to ensure that c is positive. Let&#39;s check c=4035 a -2. For a=1, c=4035*1 -2=4033&gt;0. So yes, positive.But we also need to verify that with these values of a, b, c, the function f(x)=a x² +b x +c satisfies f(r)=s and f(s)=r for r and s being -2017 and -1.Let’s test with a=1:If a=1, then b=2018*1 -1=2017, c=4035*1 -2=4033.Thus, f(x)=x² +2017x +4033.Check f(-2017):(-2017)^2 +2017*(-2017) +4033=2017² -2017² +4033=0 +4033=4033.But s should be -1. But f(-2017)=4033≠-1. So this is a problem.Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, r and s are -2017 and -1. So f(r)=s, f(s)=r.But with a=1, b=2017, c=4033, f(-2017)= (-2017)^2 +2017*(-2017) +4033=0 +4033=4033≠-1.Similarly, f(-1)= (-1)^2 +2017*(-1) +4033=1 -2017 +4033=2017.So f(-1)=2017, which is not equal to -2017. Hence, f(-2017)=4033≠-1, and f(-1)=2017≠-2017. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that with m=2018, the function satisfies f(r)=s and f(s)=r is incorrect.What&#39;s wrong here? Did we make a mistake in assuming m=2018?Wait, perhaps not. Let&#39;s recall that we derived m=2018 under the assumption that m is an integer, but that led to k=2017 or k=1, but when we plug into the function, it doesn&#39;t satisfy f(r)=s. So there must be a mistake in the logic.Wait, maybe even though we found m=2018 as an integer solution, the corresponding roots k=1 and k=2017 don&#39;t satisfy the functional equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r. Therefore, our approach is flawed.Alternative approach: Maybe the minimal a occurs when r and s are integers? Given that rs=2017, which is prime, the integer solutions for r and s are (1,2017) and (2017,1), but since rs=2017, and 2017 is prime. But in the problem, r and s are distinct real numbers, so they don&#39;t have to be integers, but if they were integers, they would be (1,2017) or (-1,-2017). But in our case, since r and s are both negative, maybe they are -1 and -2017.But when we tried a=1, b=2017, c=4033, the function didn&#39;t satisfy f(-1)= -2017 or vice versa. So maybe we need a different a.Wait, perhaps the system of equations can only be satisfied for certain a. Let&#39;s try with r=-1 and s=-2017.Assume r=-1, s=-2017. Then rs=2017. Check if f(-1)=-2017 and f(-2017)=-1.So:f(-1)=a*(-1)^2 +b*(-1) +c =a -b +c =-2017f(-2017)=a*(-2017)^2 +b*(-2017) +c =a*(2017²) -2017 b +c =-1Also, since a, b, c form an arithmetic sequence, 2b =a +c.So we have three equations:1. a - b + c = -20172. a*(2017²) -2017 b + c = -13. 2b =a +cFrom equation 3: c=2b -a. Substitute into equation 1:a - b + 2b -a = -2017 =&gt; b= -2017. But b must be a positive integer. Contradiction.Thus, impossible. Therefore, r=-1 and s=-2017 do not work with positive integers a, b, c.Similarly, trying r=-2017 and s=-1 gives the same issue. Hence, even though algebraically we found m=2018, it doesn&#39;t translate into valid integers a,b,c. Therefore, our earlier approach is missing something.Perhaps we need to consider that even though m=2018 is an integer solution for the equation m² - y²=8068, it doesn&#39;t result in a valid function f(x). Therefore, we need to look for non-integer m, but then b = a*m -1 must still be integer. Which complicates things.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s revisit the expression for a:a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S )Where S = p + q &gt; 1009, since t = r + s = - (p + q ) &lt; -1009. Therefore, S &gt; 1009.So a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ). Let&#39;s rearrange this:Let’s write a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ) = (S - 2)/(- (2S - 2018 )) = - (S - 2)/(2S - 2018 )Since a must be a positive integer, the numerator and denominator must be both negative (to have a positive a). So:(S - 2) &gt;0 and (2S -2018 ) &lt;0. But S &gt;1009, so 2S -2018 &gt; 2018 -2018=0. Contradiction.Wait, this suggests that a cannot be positive? But that&#39;s impossible because the problem states that a, b, c are positive integers. So there must be a mistake in this reasoning.Wait, let&#39;s go back. When we set S = p + q, then a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ). Since S &gt;1009, 2018 - 2S =2018 -2S. If S &gt;1009, then 2S &gt;2018, so 2018 -2S &lt;0. Therefore, denominator is negative. The numerator is S -2. Since S &gt;1009, numerator is positive. Therefore, a is negative, which contradicts the requirement that a is positive. Therefore, this suggests that there is no solution, which can&#39;t be true because the problem states that such numbers exist. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation.Wait, earlier when we derived a = - (t + 2 ) / (2018 + 2t ) where t = r + s &lt; -1009, but let&#39;s re-express this:Since t is negative, let me substitute t = -k where k &gt;1009. Then:a = - ( -k +2 ) / (2018 + 2*(-k )) = - ( -k +2 ) / (2018 -2k ) = (k -2 ) / (2018 -2k )But k &gt;1009, so denominator 2018 -2k = 2*(1009 -k ) +0 = negative, since k&gt;1009. Therefore, denominator is negative. Numerator is k -2, which is positive (k&gt;1009). So a = positive / negative = negative. Therefore, a is negative. But a must be positive. Therefore, contradiction.This suggests that there is no solution, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, we must have made a wrong turn somewhere.Wait, let&#39;s trace back. The key equation came from subtracting the two original equations:a(r² - s²) +b(r -s ) =s - rThen we factored out (r -s ):a(r +s )(r -s ) +b(r -s ) = -(r -s )Dividing both sides by (r -s ) gives:a(r +s ) +b = -1This is correct. So a(r +s ) +b = -1. Since a and b are positive integers, and r +s is t (which we thought was negative). So:a*t +b = -1But a and b are positive, so left side is positive*a*t + positive. But this equals -1, which is negative. Contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that our initial assumption is wrong.But wait, the problem states that a, b, c are positive integers forming an arithmetic sequence. The equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r with rs=2017. So according to our derivation, this leads to a contradiction, which cannot be. Therefore, we must have made an error in derivation.Wait, let&#39;s check the subtraction step:Original equations:1. a r² +b r +c =s2. a s² +b s +c =rSubtract 2 from1:a(r² -s² ) +b(r -s ) =s - rFactor:a(r -s )(r +s ) +b(r -s ) = - (r -s )Factor out (r -s ):(r -s )[a(r +s ) +b ] = - (r -s )Since r ≠s, we can divide both sides by (r -s ):a(r +s ) +b = -1This is correct. So equation (3) is indeed a(r +s ) +b = -1. Given that a and b are positive integers, the left-hand side is a sum of positive terms multiplied by a(r +s ). But since r and s are real numbers such that rs=2017, and r +s is... But if r and s are both positive, then a(r +s ) +b is positive, which cannot equal -1. Therefore, r and s must be both negative. Hence, r +s is negative. Therefore, a(r +s ) is negative, and adding b (positive) could result in -1.So, negative + positive = -1. Therefore, a(r +s ) = - (b +1 )Since a is positive and r +s is negative, so (r +s ) is negative. Hence, - (b +1 ) is negative, which implies that b +1 is positive. Which it is, since b is positive.So, a(r +s ) = - (b +1 )From the arithmetic sequence, we have 2b =a +c. Therefore, c =2b -a. Since c must be positive, 2b -a &gt;0 =&gt; a &lt;2b.But how to connect these? Let&#39;s note that from a(r +s ) = - (b +1 ), we can write r +s = - (b +1 ) /a.But also, rs=2017. Therefore, r and s are the roots of the quadratic equation x² - (r +s )x +rs=0 =&gt; x² + ( (b +1 ) /a )x +2017=0.The discriminant of this quadratic must be positive for real roots:[(b +1 ) /a ]² -4*2017 &gt;0 =&gt; (b +1 )² &gt;4*2017*a²But since a and b are positive integers, this gives a condition on a and b.Alternatively, maybe use Viète’s theorem. Let&#39;s denote r and s as the roots:r +s = - (b +1 ) /ars=2017Therefore, for integers a, b, the sum r +s must be a rational number, since it&#39;s equal to - (b +1 ) /a. But rs=2017 is an integer. So unless the quadratic x² + ( (b +1 )/a )x +2017 has integer roots, which would require that rs=2017 and r +s= - (b +1 )/a. But 2017 is prime, so the only integer roots would be ±1, ±2017. But in that case, sum of roots would be ±2018 or ±0, but we already saw that with r=-1, s=-2017, but that led to inconsistency. Therefore, perhaps the roots are not integers, but rs=2017 and sum is a rational number.Alternatively, if r and s are fractions, but given that their product is 2017, a prime, the only way is that r and s are 2017 and 1 in some order, but adjusted by signs. But since they are both negative, as we saw earlier.But given that r and s are real numbers, not necessarily integers, how can we ensure that a and b are integers?Perhaps we need to set up the equation with variables and find a relationship. Let&#39;s consider the two equations:From equation (3): a(r +s ) +b = -1 =&gt; b = -1 -a(r +s )From Viète’s theorem: r +s = - (b +1 ) /a and rs=2017.From the arithmetic sequence: 2b =a +c =&gt;c=2b -a.Now, substitute b = -1 -a(r +s ) into c=2b -a:c=2*(-1 -a(r +s )) -a= -2 -2a(r +s ) -a= -2 -a(2(r +s ) +1 )But c must be positive. So:-2 -a(2(r +s ) +1 ) &gt;0 =&gt; -a(2(r +s ) +1 ) &gt;2Since a is positive, this implies:2(r +s ) +1 &lt; -2/aBut since a &gt;=1, -2/a &gt;=-2. Therefore:2(r +s ) +1 &lt; -2/a &lt;= -2=&gt;2(r +s ) +1 &lt; -2=&gt;2(r +s ) &lt; -3=&gt;r +s &lt; -3/2But we already have from rs=2017 and r,s negative that r +s &lt;= -2*sqrt(2017 )≈ -89.8. So this condition is satisfied.But this doesn&#39;t help us directly. Maybe we need to find a relationship between a and b.From equation (3) and Viète:b = -1 -a(r +s )But from Viète, rs=2017 and r +s = - (b +1 ) /a.Alternatively, we can consider that since rs=2017 and r +s = t, then the quadratic equation is x² - t x +2017=0. The discriminant is t² -4*2017. For real roots, discriminant must be non-negative, so t² &gt;=4*2017≈8068. So |t| &gt;=sqrt(8068 )≈89.83. Since t=r +s is negative, t &lt;= -89.83.But from equation (3), a*t +b =-1. So, a*t = - (b +1 ). Since t &lt;= -89.83, and a is positive integer:a*(-89.83 ) &gt;= - (b +1 )But since t &lt;= -89.83,a*( -89.83 ) &gt;= - (b +1 ) =&gt; a*89.83 &lt;= b +1But from arithmetic sequence, 2b =a +c =&gt;c=2b -a. Also, since c &gt;b, we have 2b -a &gt;b =&gt;b &gt;a. So b &gt;=a +1.Thus, a*89.83 &lt;= (a +1 ) +1 =&gt;a*89.83 &lt;=a +2 =&gt;a*(89.83 -1 ) &lt;=2 =&gt;a*88.83 &lt;=2 =&gt;a&lt;=2/88.83≈0.0225. But a is a positive integer, so a=1.But this leads to a contradiction, since if a=1, then 1*89.83 &lt;=b +1, but b=2018*1 -1=2017 (from our previous trial). Wait, but this seems conflicting.Wait, no, this is another approach. If we assume a=1, then from the equation a*t +b =-1 =&gt; t +b =-1. But t=r +s. Also, rs=2017. So if a=1, then b= -1 -t.From the arithmetic sequence, 2b =a +c =&gt;c=2b -1.From the quadratic function f(x)=x² +b x +c.But we need to satisfy f(r)=s and f(s)=r.So:f(r)=r² +b r +c =sf(s)=s² +b s +c =rSubtract these equations:r² -s² +b(r -s )=s -rFactor:(r -s )(r +s +b )= - (r -s )Since r ≠s, divide both sides:r +s +b = -1But b= -1 -t = -1 - (r +s )So substitute into equation:(r +s ) + (-1 - (r +s )) = -1 =&gt; -1= -1. Which is true.Therefore, the equation is consistent. But we still need to verify if f(r)=s and f(s)=r.With a=1, b= -1 -t = -1 - (r +s ), c=2b -1=2*(-1 -t ) -1= -2 -2t -1= -3 -2t.But we also have from Viète’s theorem for the quadratic equation x² + (b +1 )x +2017=0 (since rs=2017 and r +s= - (b +1 )/a= - (b +1 )).Wait, if a=1, then the quadratic equation is x² +b x +c. From Viète’s theorem, r +s= -b /a= -b, and rs=c /a=c. But the problem states that rs=2017, so c=2017. But from the arithmetic sequence, c=2b -a=2b -1. Therefore:2b -1=2017 =&gt;2b=2018 =&gt;b=1009But from equation (3): a(r +s ) +b= -1 =&gt;1*(r +s ) +1009= -1 =&gt;r +s= -1010Therefore, from Viète’s theorem for the quadratic f(x)=x² +1009x +2017, we have:Sum of roots: -1009= r +s= -1010. Contradiction. Therefore, inconsistency.Hence, when a=1, we end up with conflicting requirements. Therefore, a=1 is invalid.This suggests that our previous approach has inconsistencies. Perhaps we need to consider that when we set a=1, it&#39;s impossible due to these conflicting equations. Therefore, we need to find a different a.Alternative approach: Let&#39;s consider that from equation (3): a(r +s ) +b = -1. And from the arithmetic sequence: 2b =a +c. Therefore, c=2b -a. From the quadratic function, we have:f(r)=a r² +b r +c =sBut c=2b -a, so:a r² +b r +2b -a =sSimilarly, f(s)=a s² +b s +2b -a =rLet’s write these two equations:1. a r² +b r +2b -a =s2. a s² +b s +2b -a =rLet’s subtract equation 2 from equation1:a(r² -s² ) +b(r -s ) =s -rFactor:(r -s )(a(r +s ) +b )= - (r -s )Since r ≠s, divide both sides:a(r +s ) +b = -1Which is equation (3). So, no new information.Alternatively, add the two equations:a(r² +s² ) +b(r +s ) +4b -2a =r +sLet’s denote t=r +s and note that rs=2017. Then r² +s² =t² -2*2017.So:a(t² -4034 ) +b t +4b -2a =tFrom equation (3): a t +b =-1 =&gt;b= -1 -a tSubstitute into the equation:a(t² -4034 ) + (-1 -a t )t +4*(-1 -a t ) -2a =tExpand:a t² -4034a -t -a t² -4 -4a t -2a =tSimplify:-4034a -t -4 -4a t -2a =tBring all terms to left:-4034a -t -4 -4a t -2a -t=0Combine like terms:-4034a -2a -4 -t -4a t -t=0= -4036a -4 -2t -4a t=0Factor terms:-4a t -2t -4036a -4=0Factor t:t(-4a -2 ) + (-4036a -4 )=0Solve for t:t= (4036a +4 ) / (-4a -2 )Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor numerator: 4*(1009a +1 )Denominator: -2*(2a +1 )Thus,t= [4*(1009a +1 )]/[-2*(2a +1 ) ]= -2*(1009a +1 )/(2a +1 )But t= r +s = sum of roots, which is also equal to - (b +1 ) /a from equation (3). Let&#39;s verify:From equation (3): a t +b = -1 =&gt;b= -1 -a tBut from above, t= -2*(1009a +1 )/(2a +1 )Thus,b= -1 -a * [ -2*(1009a +1 )/(2a +1 ) ]= -1 + [2a(1009a +1 )/(2a +1 ) ]So,b= [2a(1009a +1 )/(2a +1 ) ] -1But b must be a positive integer. So, let&#39;s write this as:b= [2a(1009a +1 ) - (2a +1 ) ]/(2a +1 )= [2018a² +2a -2a -1 ]/(2a +1 )=2018a² -1 over (2a +1 )Therefore,b=(2018a² -1 )/(2a +1 )Since b must be a positive integer, (2a +1 ) must divide 2018a² -1.So, let&#39;s compute 2018a² -1 modulo (2a +1 ):We can use the remainder theorem. If we divide 2018a² -1 by 2a +1, the remainder is equal to evaluating the polynomial at a= -1/2:Remainder=2018*(-1/2)^2 -1=2018*(1/4 ) -1=504.5 -1=503.5But since the remainder must be an integer, something&#39;s wrong. Wait, perhaps do polynomial division.Let’s write 2018a² -1 divided by 2a +1.Divide 2018a² by 2a: 2018a² /2a=1009a. Multiply 2a +1 by1009a: 2018a² +1009a.Subtract from 2018a² -1: (2018a² -1 ) - (2018a² +1009a )= -1009a -1.Now divide -1009a by 2a: -1009/2. Multiply 2a +1 by -1009/2: -1009a -1009/2.Subtract: (-1009a -1 ) - (-1009a -1009/2 )= -1 +1009/2= ( -2 +1009 ) /2=1007/2.Thus, 2018a² -1= (2a +1 )(1009a -1009/2 ) +1007/2.But this is messy. Alternatively, note that 2018a² -1=(2a +1 )*Q(a ) +R. But since the division leaves a fractional remainder, this suggests that (2a +1 ) does not divide 2018a² -1 unless 1007/2 is integer, which it is not. Therefore, unless 1007/2 is integer, which it isn&#39;t, so 2a +1 divides 2018a² -1 only if 1007/2 is integer. Contradiction.Therefore, for b to be integer, 2a +1 must divide 2018a² -1. But according to polynomial division, the remainder is 1007/2, which is not integer. Therefore, unless 1007/2 is integer, which it&#39;s not, there is no solution. Therefore, this suggests that there is no solution, which contradicts the problem statement.But the problem says &quot;determine the smallest possible value of a&quot;, implying that such a value exists. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the division:2018a² -1 divided by 2a +1.Let me do it step by step:Divide 2018a² by 2a: Quotient is 1009a, remainder is -1009a (since 2018a² = (2a)(1009a )).Then bring down the -1: -1009a -1.Now divide -1009a by 2a: Quotient is -1009/2, remainder is 0.But then the remainder would be -1 +1009/2*1= (1009/2 -1 ). Wait, no, this is confusing.Alternatively, using the formula:Dividend = divisor * quotient + remainderSo 2018a² -1 = (2a +1 ) * Q(a ) + RSince divisor is linear, remainder R is a constant.Let me set a= -1/2 to find R:2018*(-1/2 )² -1 = 2018*(1/4 ) -1 = 504.5 -1 = 503.5 = RTherefore, 2018a² -1 = (2a +1 )*Q(a ) +503.5But R must be zero for divisibility, but 503.5≠0. Therefore, 2a +1 does not divide 2018a² -1 for any integer a, which would mean that b is not an integer. Contradiction.Therefore, this suggests that there is no solution, which is impossible since the problem asks for one. Therefore, there must be an error in my entire approach.Alternative idea: Maybe rs=2017 is a hint. Since 2017 is prime, r and s must be factors of 2017 in some way. If we consider r and s as -1 and -2017, but we saw that leads to inconsistency. Alternatively, fractions like -2017/k and -k, but how does that help?Alternatively, consider that the equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r can be combined as f(f(r ))=r. So solving f(f(r ))=r. But since f is quadratic, this would lead to a quartic equation. However, since r and s are roots of f(f(x ))=x, but they are distinct, there must be two other roots as well. But this might not be helpful.Alternatively, subtract the equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r:f(r ) -f(s )=s -rWhich gives:a(r² -s² ) +b(r -s )= -(r -s )As before, leading to a(r +s ) +b =-1.But we already did that.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider that f(r )=s and f(s )=r. So, f(f(r ))=f(s )=r. Therefore, r is a periodic point of period 2 for f. The equation f(f(x ))=x will have roots r and s, among others. The quartic equation f(f(x ))-x=0 can be factored as (x -r )(x -s )(quadratic )=0. But this might not help directly.Alternatively, think of the function g(x )=f(x ) -x. Then, the equations f(r )=s and f(s )=r can be rewritten as g(r )=s -r and g(s )=r -s. Therefore, g(r ) +g(s )=0.So, g(r ) +g(s )=0.Which is:[a r² +b r +c -r ] + [a s² +b s +c -s ]=0Simplify:a(r² +s² ) +b(r +s ) +2c - (r +s )=0But from the arithmetic sequence, c=2b -a. Substitute:a(r² +s² ) +b(r +s ) +2(2b -a ) - (r +s )=0Expand:a(r² +s² ) +b(r +s ) +4b -2a -r -s=0From before, we have t=r +s and rs=2017, so r² +s² =t² -4034. Substitute:a(t² -4034 ) +b t +4b -2a -t=0From equation (3): a t +b =-1 =&gt;b= -1 -a t. Substitute:a(t² -4034 ) + (-1 -a t )t +4(-1 -a t ) -2a -t=0Expand:a t² -4034a -t -a t² -4 -4a t -2a -t=0Simplify:-4034a -t -4 -4a t -2a -t=0Combine like terms:-4034a -2a -4 -2t -4a t=0Factor:-4036a -4 -2t -4a t=0Which is the same equation as before. So, no progress.Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the roadblocks I&#39;m hitting, perhaps the key is to recognize that a must be even. Because in the expression a = (S - 2)/(2018 - 2S ), to make a an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator.Let me denote S =p +q &gt;1009, then a= (S -2)/(2018 -2S )Let’s write 2018 -2S =2*(1009 -S )So a= (S -2 )/[2*(1009 -S ) ]= (S -2 )/[ -2*(S -1009 ) ]= - (S -2 )/[2*(S -1009 ) ]So a= (2 -S )/[2*(S -1009 ) ]Since a must be a positive integer, (2 -S ) and [2*(S -1009 ) ] must be integers with opposite signs. Since S &gt;1009, denominator is positive, so numerator (2 -S ) must be negative. Therefore:2 -S &lt;0 =&gt;S &gt;2, which is true since S &gt;1009.So a= (S -2 )/[2*(S -1009 ) ]Wait, no:Wait, a= (2 -S )/[2*(S -1009 ) ]But since S &gt;1009, denominator is positive, numerator is 2 -S which is negative. Therefore, a is negative. But a must be positive. Contradiction. Therefore, no solution.But the problem states that a solution exists, so I must have made an error somewhere.Wait, going back to the original problem, let me check if I misunderstood something.Numbers a, b, c form an arithmetic sequence with a &lt;b &lt;c. So 2b =a +c. Correct.Function f(x )=ax² +bx +c. Two distinct real numbers r and s satisfy f(r )=s and f(s )=r. Also, rs=2017.The problem asks for the smallest possible value of a.So the key equations are:1. a r² +b r +c =s2. a s² +b s +c =r3. rs=20174. 2b =a +cVariables a, b, c are positive integers with a &lt;b &lt;c.We need to find minimal a.From equations 1 and 2, we derived a(r +s ) +b =-1. Which implies that since a and b are positive integers, r +s must be negative.Also, rs=2017, positive, so r and s are both negative.Let me define r=-p and s=-q where p and q are positive real numbers. Then rs=pq=2017, and r +s= - (p +q ). Equation (3) becomes:a*(- (p +q )) +b =-1 =&gt; -a(p +q ) +b =-1 =&gt;b =a(p +q ) -1From the arithmetic sequence: 2b =a +c =&gt;c=2b -a=2(a(p +q ) -1 ) -a=2a(p +q ) -2 -a= a(2(p +q ) -1 ) -2Since c must be positive, a(2(p +q ) -1 ) -2 &gt;0 =&gt;a(2(p +q ) -1 ) &gt;2Given that a is a positive integer and p +q &gt; sqrt(4*2017 )≈89.83, this inequality holds for any a&gt;=1.Now, we need to ensure that a, b, c are positive integers, with a &lt;b &lt;c.So b =a(p +q ) -1 must be integer. Since a is integer, (p +q ) must be rational such that a(p +q ) is integer plus 1.But p and q are real numbers with pq=2017.Let me consider that p and q are such that p +q is rational. Let’s suppose that p +q =m/n, where m and n are coprime integers. But this may not be necessary.Alternatively, since b must be integer, and b =a(p +q ) -1, then a(p +q )=b +1. So, since a and b are integers, (p +q ) must be rational. Let’s write (p +q )= (b +1 )/a.From Viète’s theorem, for the quadratic equation with roots p and q: x² - (p +q )x +pq=0 =&gt;x² - ( (b +1 )/a )x +2017=0.The discriminant must be positive:( (b +1 )/a )² -4*2017 &gt;0 =&gt; (b +1 )² &gt;4*2017*a²But since a, b are positive integers, this is a necessary condition.Also, since c=2b -a must be greater than b:2b -a &gt;b =&gt;b &gt;a.Additionally, since a &lt;b &lt;c, and a, b, c are in arithmetic sequence:c -b =b -a =&gt;c=2b -a.Thus, all conditions are encapsulated in the above.Given that, perhaps we can consider the equation (b +1 )² &gt;4*2017*a² and find minimal a such that there exists integer b &gt;a satisfying this and that (b +1 )² -4*2017*a² is a perfect square.But this seems complex. Alternatively, perhaps model this as a diophantine equation.Let’s denote k=b +1. Then, k= a(p +q ). We need:k² -4*2017*a² must be a perfect square, say d².So:k² -d²=8068*a²(k -d )(k +d )=8068*a²We need to factor 8068*a² into two factors of the same parity (since k -d and k +d are both even or both odd). Given that 8068=4*2017, so 8068*a²=4*2017*a².Let’s write 4*2017*a²=(k -d )(k +d )Let’s set:k -d=2*mk +d=2*nWhere m and n are positive integers with n &gt;m and mn=2017*a².Then:k -d=2*mk +d=2*nAdding: 2k=2(m +n ) =&gt;k=m +nSubtracting: 2d=2(n -m ) =&gt;d=n -mFrom mn=2017*a².Since 2017 is prime, the factors m and n must be such that one is multiple of 2017 and the other is multiple of a².But since mn=2017*a², and 2017 is prime, possible factor pairs (m, n ) are:1. m=1, n=2017*a²2. m=a², n=20173. m=2017, n=a²4. m=2017*a², n=1But since n &gt;m, the viable pairs are:Case1: m=1, n=2017*a². Then k=1 +2017*a², d=2017*a² -1.Case2: m=a², n=2017. Then k=a² +2017, d=2017 -a².Case3: m=2017, n=a². Disregard since n &gt;m requires a² &gt;2017, but for minimal a, this might not hold.Case4: m=2017*a², n=1. Disregard as n&gt;m is false.But let&#39;s analyze case2: m=a², n=2017.Then k= a² +2017, d=2017 -a².But d must be positive, so 2017 -a² &gt;0 =&gt;a² &lt;2017 =&gt;a &lt;=44 (since 44²=1936, 45²=2025). Therefore, possible a from1 to44.Then k= a² +2017, and from k=m +n=a² +2017.But k=b +1, so b= k -1= a² +2017 -1= a² +2016.From arithmetic sequence, c=2b -a=2*(a² +2016 ) -a=2a² +4032 -a.Also, we need to ensure that b &gt;a:a² +2016 &gt;a =&gt;a² -a +2016 &gt;0, which is true for all positive a, since discriminant=1 -4*1*2016 &lt;0.Also, c=2a² +4032 -a must be greater than b= a² +2016:2a² +4032 -a &gt;a² +2016 =&gt;a² -a +2016 &gt;0, same as before, always true.Therefore, for each a from1 to44, we have b= a² +2016, c=2a² +4032 -a.But we also need that rs=2017 and r and s satisfy the equations f(r )=s and f(s )=r.But this approach might not ensure that the quadratic function actually satisfies f(r )=s and f(s )=r. So this is a potential solution, but we need to verify if such a function exists.Alternatively, maybe the minimal a is 4, but this is just a guess. Wait, let&#39;s check a=4.If a=4, then b=4² +2016=16 +2016=2032, c=2*16 +4032 -4=32 +4032 -4=4060.So f(x )=4x² +2032x +4060.We need to check if there exist real numbers r and s such that f(r )=s, f(s )=r, and rs=2017.But how? This would require solving the system:4r² +2032r +4060=s4s² +2032s +4060=rAnd rs=2017.This system seems difficult to solve, but maybe we can use the relation rs=2017 to substitute s=2017/r into the equations.First equation:4r² +2032r +4060=2017/rMultiply by r:4r³ +2032r² +4060r -2017=0Similarly, second equation:4*(2017/r )² +2032*(2017/r ) +4060=rMultiply by r²:4*2017² +,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the smallest possible value of &#39;a&#39; where a, b, c are positive integers in an arithmetic sequence with a &lt; b &lt; c. The function f(x) = ax² + bx + c has two distinct real numbers r and s such that f(r) = s, f(s) = r, and rs = 2017. Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let&#39;s break it down step by step.First, since a, b, c form an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, b - a = c - b, which implies that c = 2b - a. That&#39;s useful because it allows us to express all three variables in terms of a and b. Since they are positive integers and a &lt; b &lt; c, then b must be at least a + 1, and c = 2b - a must be at least b + 1. Let me verify that: if b = a + 1, then c = 2(a + 1) - a = a + 2, which is indeed greater than b = a + 1. So that works. So the arithmetic sequence is a, a + d, a + 2d where d is a positive integer. Wait, but since it&#39;s an arithmetic sequence, the common difference is b - a, which is d. So maybe expressing them as a, a + d, a + 2d is helpful. But the problem states that a, b, c are positive integers forming an arithmetic sequence with a &lt; b &lt; c. So yes, that notation would work. Then, since they are in arithmetic progression, we can write b = a + d and c = a + 2d for some positive integer d. That seems like a good start.Now, moving on to the function f(x) = ax² + bx + c. We have two distinct real numbers r and s such that f(r) = s and f(s) = r. Also, rs = 2017. The problem is to find the smallest possible value of a.So, let&#39;s write down the equations given by f(r) = s and f(s) = r.First, f(r) = s =&gt; a*r² + b*r + c = s.Second, f(s) = r =&gt; a*s² + b*s + c = r.So, we have two equations:1) a r² + b r + c = s2) a s² + b s + c = rAnd we also know that r s = 2017.Additionally, since r and s are distinct real numbers, the equations must hold with r ≠ s.Our goal is to find the minimal a, given that a, b, c are positive integers in arithmetic sequence.Let me consider subtracting the two equations to eliminate c. Let&#39;s subtract equation (2) from equation (1):a r² + b r + c - (a s² + b s + c) = s - rSimplifying:a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) = s - rFactor the left side:a(r - s)(r + s) + b(r - s) = -(r - s)Since r ≠ s, we can divide both sides by (r - s):a(r + s) + b = -1So, that gives us an equation: a(r + s) + b = -1. Hmm. But a, b are positive integers, so the left side is a sum of positive terms multiplied by positive integers. However, the right side is -1, which is negative. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, let&#39;s check the subtraction again. Equation (1) minus equation (2):(a r² + b r + c) - (a s² + b s + c) = s - rWhich simplifies to:a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) = s - rThen, factor left side as a(r - s)(r + s) + b(r - s) = -(r - s)So, factor out (r - s):(r - s)[a(r + s) + b] = -(r - s)Since r ≠ s, we can divide both sides by (r - s):a(r + s) + b = -1But as a and b are positive integers, and r and s are real numbers, but their sum (r + s) is a real number. However, the left-hand side (a(r + s) + b) is supposed to equal -1. But a and b are positive integers, so unless (r + s) is negative, this equation would require a(r + s) to be negative enough to make the entire expression equal to -1. Let&#39;s see.Since a and b are positive, then a(r + s) + b = -1 implies that a(r + s) = -1 - b. Therefore, r + s = (-1 - b)/a. Since a and b are positive integers, (-1 - b)/a must be negative, which implies that r + s is negative.But we also know that rs = 2017, which is positive. So, if the product rs is positive and the sum r + s is negative, that implies that both r and s are negative real numbers. So, r and s are both negative numbers whose product is 2017 and sum is negative. That makes sense.So, even though the problem didn&#39;t specify the signs of r and s, from the equations, we can deduce they must both be negative.So, moving forward, let&#39;s note that r and s are negative real numbers with rs = 2017 and r + s = (-1 - b)/a.Let me denote:Let’s let p = r + s and q = rs = 2017. Then, we have p = (-1 - b)/a, so p = -(1 + b)/a.But since r and s are roots of some quadratic equation? Wait, not exactly. Wait, we have two equations:1) a r² + b r + c = s2) a s² + b s + c = rBut perhaps we can relate these equations. Let me rearrange equation (1):a r² + b r + c - s = 0Similarly, equation (2):a s² + b s + c - r = 0So, we have two equations here. Let me think of these as equations in r and s. Maybe we can subtract them or find a relation.Alternatively, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) + (c - s - c + r) = s - rWait, that seems more complicated. Let&#39;s see:Wait, equation (1): a r² + b r + c = sEquation (2): a s² + b s + c = rSubtracting (2) from (1):a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) = s - rWhich is what we had before. So that simplifies to a(r + s) + b = -1.So we have p = r + s = -(1 + b)/a, and q = rs = 2017.Since r and s are roots of the quadratic equation x² - p x + q = 0. Wait, but here we have a different relationship. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let&#39;s think.Alternatively, since we have f(r) = s and f(s) = r, so f(f(r)) = r. So, applying f twice brings us back to r. So, r is a fixed point of the function f(f(x)). But we know that r and s are distinct fixed points of f(f(x)) = x, but that&#39;s more of a system of equations.Alternatively, maybe we can consider the equations:From f(r) = s: a r² + b r + c = sFrom f(s) = r: a s² + b s + c = rSo, if we substitute s from the first equation into the second equation, we get:a (a r² + b r + c)² + b (a r² + b r + c) + c = rThis seems like a quartic equation, which might be complicated. But maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the fact that we have p = r + s = -(1 + b)/a and rs = 2017. So, using Vieta&#39;s formula, if we consider r and s as roots of the quadratic equation x² - p x + q = 0, then their sum is p and product is q. But in our case, p = -(1 + b)/a and q = 2017. So, the quadratic equation would be x² + [(1 + b)/a]x + 2017 = 0. Wait, because p = -(1 + b)/a, so -p = (1 + b)/a. Therefore, x² - p x + q = x² + [(1 + b)/a]x + 2017 = 0.For this quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. So, discriminant D = [(1 + b)/a]^2 - 4*1*2017 &gt; 0.So, [(1 + b)/a]^2 &gt; 4*2017.Calculate 4*2017: 2017*4 = 8068.Therefore, [(1 + b)/a]^2 &gt; 8068Taking square roots:|(1 + b)/a| &gt; sqrt(8068)But since a and b are positive integers, (1 + b)/a is positive. So, (1 + b)/a &gt; sqrt(8068)Compute sqrt(8068). Let&#39;s see, 89² = 7921, 90² = 8100. So sqrt(8068) is between 89 and 90. Let me calculate:89² = 792189*89 = 792189*90 = 80108068 - 8010 = 58So, sqrt(8068) ≈ 89 + 58/(2*89) ≈ 89 + 29/89 ≈ 89.3258...So, approximately 89.326. Therefore, (1 + b)/a &gt; 89.326, so (1 + b)/a must be at least 89.326... Since a and b are integers, (1 + b)/a must be a rational number greater than approximately 89.326. Therefore, the minimal possible value of (1 + b)/a is 90, but it could be higher. Wait, but (1 + b)/a is equal to -(r + s). Wait, earlier we had p = r + s = -(1 + b)/a, so (1 + b)/a = -p. But since p is the sum of two negative numbers, r + s is negative, so -(r + s) is positive. Therefore, (1 + b)/a is positive. Therefore, (1 + b)/a must be greater than sqrt(8068) ≈ 89.326. Therefore, the minimal integer value of (1 + b)/a is 90. Therefore, (1 + b)/a ≥ 90. Therefore, 1 + b ≥ 90a. Since b is an integer greater than a (since a &lt; b &lt; c and they are in arithmetic sequence), we have b = a + d where d is a positive integer. So, substituting b = a + d, we have 1 + a + d ≥ 90a, so d ≥ 89a -1. Since d must be a positive integer, d ≥ 89a -1. But since c = a + 2d, and c must be an integer greater than b, which is a + d. Therefore, c = a + 2d &gt; a + d, so 2d &gt; d, which is true as long as d &gt; 0, which it is. So, the minimal possible d is 89a -1. Therefore, b = a + d = a + (89a -1) = 90a -1. Then, c = a + 2d = a + 2*(89a -1) = a + 178a -2 = 179a -2.Therefore, the arithmetic sequence is a, 90a -1, 179a -2. Now, we need to ensure that these are positive integers. Since a is a positive integer, and 90a -1 and 179a -2 will also be positive for a ≥ 1.But we also need to check the discriminant condition, which was [(1 + b)/a]^2 &gt; 8068. Since we have (1 + b)/a = (1 + 90a -1)/a = 90a/a = 90. So, [(1 + b)/a]^2 = 90² = 8100, which is indeed greater than 8068. Therefore, when (1 + b)/a = 90, the discriminant is 8100 - 8068 = 32 &gt; 0, so the quadratic equation x² + 90x + 2017 = 0 has two distinct real roots. Therefore, this is acceptable.But we need to check whether such an arithmetic sequence a, 90a -1, 179a -2 can satisfy the original functional equations f(r) = s and f(s) = r with rs = 2017.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s more conditions. Let&#39;s see. We derived that if such r and s exist, then (1 + b)/a must be at least 90, and we found that the minimal possible (1 + b)/a is 90. So, if we set (1 + b)/a = 90, which gives b = 90a -1, then the quadratic equation x² + 90x + 2017 = 0 has roots r and s. Let me check if these roots satisfy the original equations f(r) = s and f(s) = r.So, let&#39;s verify this. Suppose a, b, c are in arithmetic sequence with b = 90a -1 and c = 179a -2. Then f(x) = a x² + (90a -1)x + (179a -2). Let’s check if for the roots r and s of x² + 90x + 2017 = 0, which are r and s, we have f(r) = s and f(s) = r.First, we need to confirm that a x² + (90a -1)x + (179a -2) evaluated at x = r gives s, and at x = s gives r.But let&#39;s note that since r and s satisfy x² + 90x + 2017 = 0, then for x = r, we have r² = -90r -2017. Similarly, s² = -90s -2017.So, let&#39;s compute f(r):f(r) = a r² + (90a -1) r + (179a -2)But replace r² with -90r -2017:f(r) = a*(-90r -2017) + (90a -1)r + (179a -2)Let&#39;s expand this:= -90a r -2017a + 90a r - r + 179a -2Simplify term by term:-90a r + 90a r cancels out.-2017a - r + 179a -2Combine like terms:(-2017a + 179a) + (-r -2) = (-1838a) - r - 2But according to the equation f(r) = s, this should equal s. So:-1838a - r -2 = sBut from earlier, we have r + s = -90 (since the quadratic equation x² + 90x + 2017 = 0 has sum of roots -90). Therefore, s = -90 - r.Substitute s = -90 - r into the equation:-1838a - r -2 = -90 - rSimplify:-1838a -2 = -90So:-1838a = -90 + 2 = -88Multiply both sides by -1:1838a = 88Therefore, a = 88 / 1838But 88 and 1838 can both be divided by 2:88 ÷ 2 = 441838 ÷ 2 = 919So, a = 44 / 919But 44 and 919 have no common divisors. 919 is a prime number? Let me check. 919 divided by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, etc. 31*29 is 899, 31*30=930, so 919 is prime. Therefore, a = 44/919 is not an integer. But a must be a positive integer. This is a problem.Wait, so this suggests that even though we set (1 + b)/a = 90, leading to b = 90a -1, c = 179a -2, when we check whether f(r) = s, we end up with a non-integer a. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.Hmm. Let me retrace the steps. So, we have:From the equations f(r) = s and f(s) = r, we derived that a(r + s) + b = -1. Then, since rs = 2017, and r + s = -(1 + b)/a.We also considered that the quadratic equation x² + [(1 + b)/a]x + 2017 = 0 must have real roots, hence discriminant [(1 + b)/a]^2 - 4*2017 &gt; 0. So, [(1 + b)/a]^2 &gt; 8068. Then, we assumed that the minimal value of (1 + b)/a is 90, since sqrt(8068) ≈89.326, and (1 + b)/a must be at least 90. However, when we tried (1 + b)/a = 90, we ended up with a fractional a, which is not acceptable.Therefore, our mistake was assuming that (1 + b)/a must be an integer. However, (1 + b)/a is a rational number because a and b are integers. Therefore, (1 + b)/a can be a non-integer rational number greater than sqrt(8068). However, for the discriminant to be a perfect square (since the roots need to be real but not necessarily rational), but actually, the roots can be irrational as long as discriminant is positive. So, (1 + b)/a just needs to be a real number greater than sqrt(8068). However, since (1 + b)/a is (1 + b)/a where a and b are positive integers, it&#39;s a rational number. Therefore, we need (1 + b)/a &gt; sqrt(8068). Therefore, the minimal possible value of (1 + b)/a is the smallest rational number greater than sqrt(8068) such that (1 + b)/a is rational and a, b are positive integers with b = a + d (arithmetic sequence). Therefore, perhaps we need to find the minimal a such that (1 + b)/a is a rational number just above sqrt(8068), which is approximately 89.326.But since (1 + b)/a must be rational, let&#39;s write (1 + b)/a = k, where k is a rational number greater than sqrt(8068). Since b = a + d, and c = a + 2d, then (1 + a + d)/a = k =&gt; (1 + d)/a + 1 = k. Therefore, (1 + d)/a = k -1. Therefore, since a and d are positive integers, k -1 must be a rational number of the form (1 + d)/a.Thus, k must be 1 + (1 + d)/a. But this may not directly help. Alternatively, since (1 + b)/a is equal to k, then (1 + b)/a must be a rational number. To minimize a, we need to find the smallest a such that there exists an integer b = a + d (with d ≥1, as b &gt; a) such that (1 + b)/a &gt; sqrt(8068) ≈89.326, and that when solving the equation -1838a - r -2 = s (from the earlier substitution), we can get integer a. Wait, but in our previous attempt, we ended up with a fractional a because we forced (1 + b)/a = 90, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps we need to consider higher values of (1 + b)/a, not just the minimal integer greater than sqrt(8068), but higher fractions.Alternatively, maybe we need to approach this problem differently. Let&#39;s go back to the equations:From f(r) = s and f(s) = r, we have:1) a r² + b r + c = s2) a s² + b s + c = rSubtracting the second equation from the first:a(r² - s²) + b(r - s) = s - rAs before, which leads to a(r + s) + b = -1.We also have rs = 2017.So, let&#39;s denote p = r + s = -(1 + b)/a and q = rs = 2017.Then, we can write the quadratic equation as x² - p x + q = 0, but with p = -(1 + b)/a and q = 2017. Wait, actually, the quadratic equation with roots r and s is x² - (r + s)x + rs = x² - p x + q = 0. But since p = -(1 + b)/a, that quadratic equation is x² + [(1 + b)/a]x + 2017 = 0.But the key point is that r and s satisfy both the quadratic equation and the original functional equations. So perhaps we can use the quadratic equation to express higher powers of r and s in terms of p and q.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the original function f(x) = a x² + b x + c. If f(r) = s and f(s) = r, then f(f(r)) = f(s) = r. Therefore, r is a fixed point of the function f(f(x)). Similarly, s is also a fixed point. Therefore, the equation f(f(x)) = x must have solutions r and s. So, let&#39;s compute f(f(x)):f(f(x)) = a*(a x² + b x + c)^2 + b*(a x² + b x + c) + cExpanding this would lead to a quartic equation, but since we know that r and s are roots, we can factor out (x - r)(x - s). However, this might get too complicated.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the equations we have. Let&#39;s recall that:From equation (1): a r² + b r + c = sFrom equation (2): a s² + b s + c = rWe can substitute s from equation (1) into equation (2):a (a r² + b r + c)^2 + b (a r² + b r + c) + c = rThis is a quartic equation in r. However, since we know that rs = 2017, and s = a r² + b r + c, we can substitute s = 2017/r into equation (1):a r² + b r + c = 2017/rMultiply both sides by r:a r³ + b r² + c r - 2017 = 0Similarly, from equation (2):a s² + b s + c = rAgain, s = 2017/r, so:a (2017/r)^2 + b (2017/r) + c = rMultiply both sides by r²:a*(2017)^2 + b*2017*r + c r² - r^3 = 0So, we have two equations:1) a r³ + b r² + c r - 2017 = 02) -r³ + c r² + b*2017 r + a*(2017)^2 = 0Let me write them as:Equation (1): a r³ + b r² + c r - 2017 = 0Equation (2): -r³ + c r² + 2017b r + a*(2017)^2 = 0Now, perhaps we can subtract these equations or find a linear combination to eliminate variables.Alternatively, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):(a r³ + b r² + c r - 2017) - (-r³ + c r² + 2017b r + a*(2017)^2) = 0Simplify term by term:a r³ + r³ + b r² - c r² + c r - 2017b r -2017 - a*(2017)^2 = 0Factor:r³(a + 1) + r²(b - c) + r(c - 2017b) - (2017 + a*(2017)^2) = 0But since c = 2b - a (from the arithmetic sequence), we can substitute c = 2b - a into the equation:r³(a + 1) + r²(b - (2b - a)) + r((2b - a) - 2017b) - (2017 + a*(2017)^2) = 0Simplify each term:First term: r³(a + 1)Second term: r²(b -2b + a) = r²(-b + a)Third term: r(2b -a -2017b) = r(-2015b -a)Fourth term: - (2017 + a*2017²)Therefore, the equation becomes:(a + 1) r³ + (a - b) r² - (2015b + a) r - 2017(1 + a*2017) = 0This seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor out common terms or find a relation. Alternatively, let&#39;s recall that we have another equation from before: a(r + s) + b = -1. Since rs = 2017, and r + s = -(1 + b)/a, we can express s in terms of r: s = 2017/r. Then, r + 2017/r = -(1 + b)/a. Let&#39;s denote this as:r + 2017/r = -(1 + b)/aMultiply both sides by r:r² + 2017 = -(1 + b)/a * rWhich gives:r² + [(1 + b)/a] r + 2017 = 0But this is the same quadratic equation we had earlier, which is consistent. So, perhaps this path is not giving us new information.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that we have two equations:1) a r² + b r + c = s2) a s² + b s + c = rAnd rs = 2017.Let me try to express c from equation (1): c = s - a r² - b rSimilarly, from equation (2): c = r - a s² - b sSet them equal:s - a r² - b r = r - a s² - b sRearranging terms:s - r = a r² + b r - a s² - b sFactor the right side:= a(r² - s²) + b(r - s)= a(r - s)(r + s) + b(r - s)= (r - s)[a(r + s) + b]Therefore:s - r = (r - s)[a(r + s) + b]Multiply both sides by -1:r - s = (r - s)[a(r + s) + b]Since r ≠ s, we can divide both sides by (r - s):1 = a(r + s) + bWait, this contradicts our earlier result where we had a(r + s) + b = -1. Wait, this is a problem. Let me check this step again.Starting from:s - a r² - b r = r - a s² - b sSo, bringing all terms to the left side:s - a r² - b r - r + a s² + b s = 0Factor:a(s² - r²) + b(s - r) + (s - r) = 0Factor:(s - r)[a(s + r) + b + 1] = 0Since s ≠ r, then:a(s + r) + b + 1 = 0Which implies:a(r + s) + b = -1Which is consistent with our previous result. Therefore, there was a miscalculation in the previous step where I thought I arrived at 1 = a(r + s) + b. That must have been an error. So, in fact, it&#39;s correct that a(r + s) + b = -1.Therefore, no contradiction here. So, our key equations are:1) a(r + s) + b = -12) rs = 2017And since r and s are roots of the quadratic equation x² + [(1 + b)/a]x + 2017 = 0, which has discriminant [(1 + b)/a]^2 - 4*2017 &gt; 0.So, moving forward, since a and b are positive integers, and (1 + b)/a must be greater than sqrt(8068) ≈89.326, as we established before.Therefore, to find the minimal a, we need to find the smallest a such that (1 + b)/a &gt; 89.326 and that the system of equations has a solution with rs = 2017. Additionally, since a, b, c are in arithmetic progression, we can express b and c in terms of a and the common difference d.Given that b = a + d and c = a + 2d, we can substitute into the equation (1 + b)/a = (1 + a + d)/a = 1 + (1 + d)/a.Wait, that&#39;s not right. (1 + b)/a = (1 + a + d)/a = (a + d +1)/a = 1 + (d +1)/a.So, (1 + b)/a = 1 + (d +1)/a. Therefore, since d ≥1 (since b &gt; a), then (d +1)/a ≥ 2/a. Therefore, (1 + b)/a = 1 + (d +1)/a ≥ 1 + 2/a. For a ≥1, this is at least 1 + 2/1 = 3. But we need this to be greater than approximately 89.326. Therefore, (d +1)/a must be greater than approximately 88.326. So, (d +1)/a &gt; 88.326. Therefore, d +1 &gt; 88.326a. Since d +1 and a are integers, d +1 ≥ 88.326a +1. But since d must be an integer, we have d ≥ floor(88.326a). Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted.Alternatively, since (1 + b)/a = 1 + (d +1)/a must be greater than 89.326, then:1 + (d +1)/a &gt; 89.326=&gt; (d +1)/a &gt; 88.326=&gt; d +1 &gt; 88.326aSince d and a are integers, d +1 ≥ ceiling(88.326a +1). Hmm, but this seems too vague.Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize (1 + b)/a as a rational number slightly larger than sqrt(8068), and find a and b such that (1 + b)/a is that rational number. For example, sqrt(8068) ≈89.326, so the next possible rational number greater than this would be 89.333... = 268/3 ≈89.333, which is larger than 89.326. So, if we take (1 + b)/a = 268/3, then (1 + b) = (268/3)a. Since 1 + b must be an integer, a must be a multiple of 3. Let’s try a = 3:Then, 1 + b = 268/3 * 3 = 268 =&gt; b = 267. Then, c = 2b -a = 534 - 3 = 531. So, the sequence is 3, 267, 531. Check if a &lt; b &lt; c: 3 &lt; 267 &lt; 531, yes. Then, check if this gives us valid roots r and s such that rs = 2017 and f(r) = s, f(s) = r.But first, check discriminant: [(1 + b)/a]^2 -4*2017 = (268/3)^2 - 8068 ≈(89.333)^2 -8068 ≈7982.222 -8068 ≈-85.777, which is negative. Therefore, the quadratic equation would have no real roots. Therefore, this is invalid. Therefore, even though 268/3 ≈89.333 is greater than sqrt(8068)≈89.326, the discriminant is still negative. Therefore, this is not acceptable.Therefore, we need to choose (1 + b)/a such that [(1 + b)/a]^2 &gt; 8068. So, let&#39;s compute (268/3)^2 = (268)^2 /9 = 71824 /9 ≈7980.444, which is less than 8068. Therefore, even 268/3 is insufficient. Therefore, we need a higher value.Let me compute sqrt(8068) exactly. sqrt(8068) = sqrt(4*2017) = 2*sqrt(2017). Since 2017 is a prime number, sqrt(2017) ≈44.911, so sqrt(8068)≈2*44.911≈89.822. Wait, wait, this contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, 44.911² = (44 +0.911)² = 44² + 2*44*0.911 +0.911² = 1936 + 80.0 +0.829 ≈2016.829, which is approximately 2017. Therefore, sqrt(2017)≈44.911, so sqrt(8068)=sqrt(4*2017)=2*sqrt(2017)≈89.822. Therefore, my initial approximation was wrong. sqrt(8068)≈89.822, not 89.326. That was a miscalculation earlier.Wait, let&#39;s recalculate:2017 *4 = 8068.Compute sqrt(8068):Divide 8068 by 4: 2017. So sqrt(8068) = sqrt(4*2017) = 2*sqrt(2017).Now, sqrt(2017): 44² = 1936; 45² = 2025. So sqrt(2017) is between 44 and 45. 2017 - 44² = 2017 - 1936 = 81. So, sqrt(2017) ≈44 + 81/(2*44) ≈44 + 81/88 ≈44.920. Therefore, sqrt(8068) ≈2*44.920≈89.84. So, (1 + b)/a must be greater than approximately89.84. Therefore, the minimal integer value is 90. But when we tried (1 + b)/a = 90, we ended up with a fractional a. Therefore, we need to find a fraction slightly greater than 89.84, say 89.85 or 89.9, such that (1 + b)/a is that fraction, and a and b are integers. But since (1 + b)/a must be rational, we need to find a fraction p/q where p and q are integers, p/q &gt; sqrt(8068), and such that (1 + b)/a = p/q, leading to b = (p/q)*a -1. Since b must be an integer, then (p*a)/q -1 must be integer. Therefore, (p*a)/q must be an integer, which implies that q divides p*a. Therefore, to minimize a, we can set q to divide p*a. So, perhaps the minimal a is the denominator of the reduced fraction of p/q, where p/q is the minimal fraction greater than sqrt(8068)≈89.84.Alternatively, since sqrt(8068)≈89.84, the next possible fraction is 89.85, but this is not helpful. Instead, perhaps we need to find the minimal denominator such that p/q &gt; sqrt(8068). This is equivalent to finding the minimal a such that there exists an integer p where p/a &gt; sqrt(8068), and (p -1) must be divisible by a. Wait, because b = (p -1)/a -1? Wait, no. Wait, we have (1 + b)/a = p/q, but if we let (1 + b)/a = k, then b = a*k -1. Therefore, for b to be an integer, a*k -1 must be integer. Since a and b are integers, k must be a rational number such that a*k is an integer. Therefore, k can be written as m/a, where m is an integer. Therefore, k = m/a =&gt; (1 + b)/a = m/a =&gt; 1 + b = m =&gt; b = m -1. But since b = a + d, this implies that m -1 = a + d =&gt; d = m -1 -a. Since d must be positive, m -1 -a &gt;0 =&gt; m &gt; a +1.But (1 + b)/a = m/a must be greater than sqrt(8068). Therefore, m/a &gt; sqrt(8068). So, m &gt; a*sqrt(8068). Since m and a are positive integers, m must be the smallest integer greater than a*sqrt(8068). Therefore, for each a, m = floor(a*sqrt(8068)) +1. Then, b = m -1 = floor(a*sqrt(8068)) +1 -1 = floor(a*sqrt(8068)). Therefore, b = floor(a*sqrt(8068)), and we need to check if (1 + b)/a &gt; sqrt(8068). This is true because m = floor(a*sqrt(8068)) +1, so (1 + b)/a = m/a = (floor(a*sqrt(8068)) +1)/a &gt; sqrt(8068).But since b must be in an arithmetic progression with a and c = 2b -a, and we need to ensure that c is a positive integer greater than b.But the key point is that for each a, we can compute b = floor(a*sqrt(8068)) and check if the arithmetic progression a, b, c = 2b -a satisfies the original functional equations. However, this approach might require testing many values of a until we find the smallest one that works. Given that sqrt(8068)≈89.84, the minimal a is likely around 1 or higher, but we saw that a =1 would require b = floor(89.84) =89, then c =2*89 -1=177. Then check if this sequence 1,89,177 satisfies the equations.Wait, let&#39;s try a=1.If a=1, then b = floor(1*sqrt(8068)) =floor(89.84)=89. Then c=2*89 -1=177-1=177? Wait, c=2b -a=2*89 -1=178 -1=177. Wait, 2*89=178, minus 1 is 177. So, the sequence is 1,89,177.Then, check if this works.Given f(x)=x² +89x +177.We need to find two distinct real numbers r and s such that f(r)=s, f(s)=r, and rs=2017.First, let&#39;s check the condition a(r + s) + b = -1 =&gt; 1*(r + s) +89= -1 =&gt; r + s= -90.We also have rs=2017.Therefore, the quadratic equation is x² +90x +2017=0. Let&#39;s compute its discriminant: D=90² -4*1*2017=8100 -8068=32&gt;0. So, two distinct real roots. The roots are r=(-90 ±sqrt(32))/2=(-90 ±4*sqrt(2))/2=-45 ±2*sqrt(2). These are two irrational numbers. Their product is 2017, and their sum is -90.Now, check if f(r)=s and f(s)=r.Given that f(r)=s and f(s)=r, and rs=2017.Let’s take r=-45 +2√2 and s=-45 -2√2. Wait, no. Wait, since rs=2017, and r and s are negative numbers. Wait, actually, the roots are r=[-90 +sqrt(32)]/2= -45 + (4*sqrt(2))/2= -45 +2*sqrt(2)≈-45 +2.828≈-42.172, and s= -45 -2*sqrt(2)≈-47.828. Both are negative, product is 2017.Now, compute f(r):f(r)=r² +89r +177.But since r is a root of x² +90x +2017=0, we have r²= -90r -2017. Substitute into f(r):f(r)=(-90r -2017) +89r +177= (-90r +89r) + (-2017 +177)= (-r) + (-1840).But f(r)=s, so:s= -r -1840.But from the quadratic equation, s= -90 -r. Therefore:-90 -r = -r -1840 =&gt; -90 = -1840. This is obviously false. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, a=1 does not work.Therefore, a=1 is invalid.This suggests that even though we have a quadratic equation with real roots, the functional equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r are not satisfied unless additional conditions are met. Therefore, our previous approach is missing something. Therefore, perhaps we need to ensure that the equation -1838a - r -2 = s holds, which we derived earlier. Wait, where did that come from? Let me recap.Earlier, we substituted s from f(r)=s into the equation f(s)=r:f(r)=s =&gt; a r² +b r +c =sThen f(s)=r =&gt; a s² +b s +c =rThen, substituting s= a r² +b r +c into the second equation:a(a r² +b r +c)^2 +b(a r² +b r +c) +c =rExpanding this gave us a quartic equation in r, but we attempted to substitute using the quadratic equation r²= -90r -2017 for the case when a=1, b=89, c=177. However, when we did that, we ended up with a contradiction. Therefore, even though the quadratic equation is satisfied, the higher-degree equations are not, meaning that the functional equations f(r)=s and f(s)=r are not automatically satisfied just by having rs=2017 and r + s= -(1 + b)/a. Therefore, there must be another condition that needs to be met.Let me go back to the earlier equation where we substituted r² = -90r -2017 into f(r):For a=1, b=89, c=177:f(r) = r² +89r +177 = (-90r -2017) +89r +177 = (-90r +89r) + (-2017 +177) = -r -1840.But f(r)=s, so s= -r -1840.But from the quadratic equation, we also have s= -90 -r.Therefore:-90 -r = -r -1840 =&gt; -90 = -1840, which is false. Therefore, the equations are inconsistent.Therefore, the assumption that a=1, b=89, c=177 doesn&#39;t work, even though the quadratic equation has real roots.This means that there must be additional constraints. The functional equations impose more conditions beyond just rs=2017 and r + s= -(1 + b)/a.Let me recall that we had an equation when we tried to substitute s=2017/r into the equation a r³ +b r² +c r=2017.Wait, let&#39;s revisit that approach.We have from f(r)=s: a r² +b r +c = s, and rs=2017 =&gt; s=2017/r.Therefore:a r² +b r +c =2017/r =&gt; Multiply both sides by r:a r³ +b r² +c r -2017=0.Similarly, from f(s)=r: a s² +b s +c =r. Since s=2017/r:a*(2017/r)^2 +b*(2017/r) +c =r =&gt; Multiply both sides by r²:a*(2017)^2 +b*2017*r +c r² -r³=0.Now, we have two equations:1) a r³ +b r² +c r -2017=02) -r³ +c r² +b*2017 r +a*(2017)^2=0Let’s denote equation (1) as Eq1 and equation (2) as Eq2.We can try to eliminate variables between these equations. Let&#39;s try multiplying Eq1 by r and add Eq2:Multiply Eq1 by r:a r^4 +b r³ +c r² -2017 r=0Add Eq2:(a r^4 +b r³ +c r² -2017 r) + (-r³ +c r² +b*2017 r +a*(2017)^2) =0Combine like terms:a r^4 + (b r³ - r³) + (c r² +c r²) + (-2017 r + b*2017 r) + a*(2017)^2 =0Simplify:a r^4 + (b -1) r³ + 2c r² + 2017(b -1) r + a*(2017)^2=0This is a quartic equation in r, which seems even more complex. But since we know that r satisfies the quadratic equation x² + [(1 + b)/a]x +2017=0, maybe we can express higher powers of r in terms of lower powers.For example, from the quadratic equation, r² = -[(1 + b)/a]r -2017.Then, r³ = r*r² = r*(-[(1 + b)/a]r -2017) = -[(1 + b)/a]r² -2017r = -[(1 + b)/a]*(-[(1 + b)/a]r -2017) -2017r = [(1 + b)^2/a²]r + [(1 + b)/a]*2017 -2017r.Similarly, this can be substituted into the quartic equation. However, this might get very messy.Alternatively, since we have expressions for r² and r³ in terms of r, perhaps we can substitute them into Eq1 and Eq2.From the quadratic equation:r² = -[(1 + b)/a]r -2017.From Eq1: a r³ +b r² +c r -2017=0.Let’s compute r³:r³ = r*r² = r*(-[(1 + b)/a]r -2017) = -[(1 + b)/a] r² -2017 r.But r² = -[(1 + b)/a]r -2017, so:r³ = -[(1 + b)/a]*(-[(1 + b)/a]r -2017) -2017r = [(1 + b)^2/a²]r + [(1 + b)/a]*2017 -2017r.Substitute r³ into Eq1:a [ ( (1 + b)^2/a² ) r + ( (1 + b)/a )*2017 -2017r ] + b*(- (1 + b)/a r -2017 ) +c r -2017=0.Simplify term by term:First term:a*( (1 + b)^2/a² r ) = (1 + b)^2/a rSecond term:a*( (1 + b)/a *2017 )= (1 + b)*2017Third term:a*(-2017r )= -2017a rFourth term:b*(- (1 + b)/a r )= -b(1 + b)/a rFifth term:b*(-2017 )= -2017bSixth term:c rSeventh term:-2017Combine all terms:[(1 + b)^2/a r -2017a r -b(1 + b)/a r +c r] + [(1 + b)*2017 -2017b -2017]=0Factor r from the first bracket:r [ (1 + b)^2/a -2017a -b(1 + b)/a +c ] + [ (1 + b)*2017 -2017b -2017 ]=0Simplify the second bracket:(1 + b)*2017 -2017b -2017 = 2017 + 2017b -2017b -2017 =0.Therefore, the second bracket is zero.Now, simplify the first bracket:r [ (1 + b)^2/a -2017a -b(1 + b)/a +c ]=0Since r ≠0 (as rs=2017), then the expression in brackets must be zero:(1 + b)^2/a -2017a -b(1 + b)/a +c =0Combine terms:[(1 + b)^2 -b(1 + b)]/a -2017a +c =0Factor numerator:(1 + b)(1 + b -b)/a -2017a +c = (1 + b)(1)/a -2017a +c = (1 + b)/a -2017a +c=0Thus:(1 + b)/a -2017a +c=0But c=2b -a (from arithmetic sequence). Substitute:(1 + b)/a -2017a +2b -a=0Combine like terms:(1 + b)/a +2b -2018a=0Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:1 + b +2ab -2018a²=0Rearranged:2018a² -2ab - (1 + b)=0This is a quadratic equation in terms of a:2018a² -2ab - (1 + b)=0But since b is related to a via the arithmetic sequence. Recall that b = a + d, and c = a + 2d, so d = b -a. However, we need to express this equation in terms of a and b.Let me write the equation again:2018a² -2ab - (1 + b)=0Let’s rearrange terms:2018a² -2ab -b -1=0Factor b:2018a² -b(2a +1) -1=0Solve for b:b(2a +1) =2018a² -1Therefore,b=(2018a² -1)/(2a +1)Since b must be a positive integer, (2018a² -1) must be divisible by (2a +1). Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer a such that (2a +1) divides (2018a² -1). This is a Diophantine equation problem.So, we need to find the smallest positive integer a for which (2a +1) | (2018a² -1). Let’s denote k = 2a +1, then a = (k -1)/2. Substitute into 2018a² -1:2018*((k -1)/2)^2 -1 =2018*(k² -2k +1)/4 -1= (2018/4)(k² -2k +1) -1.We need this to be divisible by k. Therefore:(2018/4)(k² -2k +1) -1 ≡0 mod kMultiply through by 4 to eliminate fraction:2018(k² -2k +1) -4 ≡0 mod kBut since k divides k² -2k +1 and k divides k² and -2k, then k divides the entire term 2018(k² -2k +1) -4. Therefore, 2018(k² -2k +1) -4 ≡0 mod kSimplify modulo k:2018*(0 -0 +1) -4 ≡0 mod k2018*1 -4 ≡0 mod k2014 ≡0 mod kTherefore, k must be a divisor of 2014.Given that k=2a +1 and a is a positive integer, then k must be an odd divisor of 2014 greater than 1 (since a ≥1 =&gt;k=2*1 +1=3).First, factorize 2014:2014 ÷2=10071007 is prime? Let&#39;s check. 1007 ÷19=53. Indeed, 19*53=1007. So, 2014=2*19*53.Therefore, the positive divisors of 2014 are 1,2,19,38,53,106,1007,2014.But k must be an odd divisor of 2014 greater than or equal to3 (since a is positive integer, k=2a +1 ≥3). The odd divisors of 2014 are 1,19,53,1007. Excluding 1, we have 19,53,1007.Therefore, possible values of k=19,53,1007.Therefore, possible values of a=(k -1)/2:For k=19: a=(19 -1)/2=9For k=53: a=(53 -1)/2=26For k=1007: a=(1007 -1)/2=503Therefore, possible a values are 9,26,503,...We need to check these a values to see if they produce valid arithmetic sequences and whether b and c are positive integers.First, a=9:k=19, so b=(2018*9² -1)/(2*9 +1)=(2018*81 -1)/19Calculate 2018*81:2018*80=161,4402018*1=2,018Total=161,440 +2,018=163,458163,458 -1=163,457Divide by19:163,457 ÷19.Calculate 19*8000=152,000163,457 -152,000=11,45719*600=11,40011,457 -11,400=5719*3=57Total:8000 +600 +3=8603.Therefore, b=8603.Then, c=2b -a=2*8603 -9=17206 -9=172,197.So, the arithmetic sequence is 9,8603,17197.Check if this is valid: common difference is8603 -9=8594 and17197 -8603=8594. Yes, valid.Now, check if this satisfies the original conditions with rs=2017.Given a=9, b=8603, c=17197.The quadratic equation x² + [(1 + b)/a]x +2017=0.Compute (1 + b)/a=(1 +8603)/9=8604/9=956.Therefore, the quadratic equation isx² +956x +2017=0.Check discriminant:956² -4*1*2017=914, 956² is 956*956.Compute 956^2:First compute 900^2=810,000Then compute 56^2=3,136Then compute 2*900*56=100,800So, 956^2=(900+56)^2=900^2 +2*900*56 +56^2=810,000 +100,800 +3,136=913,936Then subtract4*2017=8068:913,936 -8,068=905,868The discriminant is905,868, which is a perfect square? Let&#39;s check.sqrt(905,868). Let&#39;s approximate. 952^2=906, 904; 951^2=904,401+951+950=904,401+1,901=906,302. Wait, wait, let me compute 951^2:950^2=902,500951^2=950^2 +2*950 +1=902,500 +1,900 +1=904,401952^2=951^2 +2*951 +1=904,401 +1,902 +1=906,304But our discriminant is905,868. Between951^2=904,401 and952^2=906,304. Let&#39;s check if 951.5^2=?(951 +0.5)^2=951^2 +2*951*0.5 +0.25=904,401 +951 +0.25=905,352.25Still less than905,868. Then, 951.75^2=951.5^2 +2*951.5*0.25 +0.25²=905,352.25 +475.75 +0.0625=905,828.0625Still less than905,868. Then, 951.75 +0.5=952.25^2=906,304 +2*952*0.25 +0.25²=906,304 +476 +0.0625=906,780.0625. Too high. Therefore, the discriminant is not a perfect square, so the roots are irrational. But we need real roots, which they are, but the problem doesn&#39;t require them to be integers. So, this is acceptable.Now, check if f(r)=s and f(s)=r.Given f(x)=9x² +8603x +17197.We need to check if f(r)=s and f(s)=r, where r and s are roots of x² +956x +2017=0.From the quadratic equation, r + s= -956 and rs=2017.From the earlier equation a(r + s) + b= -1:9*(-956) +8603= -8,604 +8,603= -1. Yes, this holds.Now, check f(r)=s.Given r is a root of x² +956x +2017=0, so r²= -956r -2017.Compute f(r)=9r² +8603r +17197.Substitute r²= -956r -2017:f(r)=9*(-956r -2017) +8603r +17197= -8,604r -18,153 +8,603r +17,197= (-8,604r +8,603r) + (-18,153 +17,197)= (-r) + (-956)But from the quadratic equation, s= -956 -r. Therefore, f(r)= -r -956 = s. Which matches. Similarly, f(s)=r can be verified similarly. Therefore, this works.Therefore, a=9 is a valid solution.Now, check if a=26 works.For a=26:k=53, so a=(53 -1)/2=26.Compute b=(2018*(26)^2 -1)/(2*26 +1)= (2018*676 -1)/53.Calculate 2018*676:First compute 2000*676=1,352,000Then 18*676=12,168Total=1,352,000 +12,168=1,364,168Subtract 1:1,364,168 -1=1,364,167Divide by53:1,364,167 ÷53.Calculate 53*25,000=1,325,0001,364,167 -1,325,000=39,16753*700=37,10039,167 -37,100=2,06753*39=2,067Total:25,000 +700 +39=25,739.Therefore, b=25,739.Then, c=2b -a=2*25,739 -26=51,478 -26=51,452.So, the sequence is26,25,739,51,452. Common difference25,739 -26=25,713;51,452 -25,739=25,713. Valid.Check quadratic equation:(1 + b)/a=(1 +25,739)/26=25,740/26=990.Therefore, quadratic equationx² +990x +2017=0.Discriminant:990² -4*1*2017=980,100 -8,068=972,032.sqrt(972,032)=approx 985.9. Not a perfect square, so roots are irrational. But still, check if f(r)=s and f(s)=r.Since a(r + s) + b=26*(-990) +25,739= -25,740 +25,739=-1. OK.Now, compute f(r)=26r² +25,739r +51,452.Since r²= -990r -2017,f(r)=26*(-990r -2017) +25,739r +51,452= -25,740r -52,442 +25,739r +51,452= (-25,740r +25,739r) + (-52,442 +51,452)= (-r) + (-990)= -r -990.But from quadratic equation, s= -990 -r. Therefore, f(r)=s. Similarly, f(s)=r. Therefore, valid.Therefore, a=26 also works, but since we are to find the smallest possible a, a=9 is smaller.Similarly, a=503 would work, but it&#39;s larger.Therefore, the minimal possible a is9.But we need to confirm that there are no smaller a. Earlier, we found possible a=9,26,503,... Since the divisors of2014 are limited and the next divisor after19 is53, which gives a=26, and then1007 gives a=503, there are no smaller a than9.Therefore, the answer is boxed{9}Final Answerboxed{9}&lt;/think&gt;Given positive integers (a, b, c) forming an arithmetic sequence with (a &lt; b &lt; c), we need to determine the smallest possible value of (a) such that the quadratic function (f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c) satisfies (f(r) = s) and (f(s) = r) for two distinct real numbers (r) and (s) with (rs = 2017).1. Arithmetic Sequence: Since (a, b, c) form an arithmetic sequence, we have (b = a + d) and (c = a + 2d) for some positive integer (d).2. Functional Equations: Given (f(r) = s) and (f(s) = r), we derived the equation:   [   a(r + s) + b = -1   ]   Using (rs = 2017), we also have the quadratic equation (x^2 + frac{1 + b}{a}x + 2017 = 0) with roots (r) and (s).3. Discriminant Condition: For the quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be positive:   [   left(frac{1 + b}{a}right)^2 &gt; 4 cdot 2017   ]   Calculating the approximate value, we found (sqrt{8068} approx 89.84). Thus, (frac{1 + b}{a}) must be slightly greater than this value.4. Diophantine Equation: Solving for (b) in terms of (a) using the equation (2018a^2 - 2ab - (1 + b) = 0), we found that (2a + 1) must divide (2018a^2 - 1). This leads to checking divisors of 2014.5. Valid Divisors: The odd divisors of 2014 are 19, 53, and 1007. Corresponding values of (a) are:   - (a = 9) for (k = 19)   - (a = 26) for (k = 53)   - (a = 503) for (k = 1007)6. Verification: Checking the smallest (a = 9), we found the arithmetic sequence (9, 8603, 17197) satisfies all conditions with the quadratic equation (x^2 + 956x + 2017 = 0) and verified (f(r) = s) and (f(s) = r).Thus, the smallest possible value of (a) is (boxed{9}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8995579a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>🔑:</span>Correct answer: 9 .Solution 1: Note thatbegin{array}{l}a r^{2}+b r+c=s a s^{2}+b s+c=rend{array}Subtracting the second equation from the first yieldsbegin{aligned}aleft(r^{2}-s^{2}right)+b(r-s) &amp; =-(r-s) Rightarrow a(r+s)(r-s)+(b+1)(r-s)=0 Rightarrow &amp; (a(r+s)+b+1)(r-s)=0 .end{aligned}Since r neq s, r+s=-frac{b+1}{a}.Substituting s=-frac{b+1}{a}-r into the first equation yields a r^{2}+b r+c=-frac{b+1}{a}-r Rightarrow a r^{2}+(b+1) r+c+frac{b+1}{a}=0.

Then we have frac{a+2 k}{a}+frac{a+k+1}{a^{2}}=2017 and sok=frac{2016 a^{2}-1-a}{2 a+1}=1008 a-504+frac{503-a}{2 a+1}=1008 a-504+frac{1}{2}left(frac{1007}{2 a+1}-1right) .Thus, in order for k to be integer, 2 a+1 must be a factor of 1007=19 times 53. Thus, a=9, a=26 or a=503.The smallest positive integer a for which k is an integer is a=9.For completeness, we find k=8594 and so b=8603 and c=17197.Then, r=-478+3 sqrt{25163} and s=-478-3 sqrt{25163} satisfy the above relations.The answer is 9 .A second solution is provided on the next page.Solution 2: Note thatbegin{array}{l}a r^{2}+b r+c=s a s^{2}+b s+c=rend{array}Subtracting the second equation from the first yieldsbegin{aligned}aleft(r^{2}-s^{2}right)+b(r-s) &amp; =-(r-s) Rightarrow a(r+s)(r-s)+(b+1)(r-s)=0 Rightarrow &amp; (a(r+s)+b+1)(r-s)=0,end{aligned}since r neq s, r+s=-frac{b+1}{a}.Adding (1) and (2) we getaleft((r+s)^{2}-2 r sright)+b(r+s)+2 c=r+s .Using r+s=-frac{b+1}{a} and r s=2017, we obtainfrac{(b+1)^{2}}{a}-2 a cdot 2017-frac{(b+1)(b-1)}{a}+2 c=0and thenfrac{2(b+1)}{a}-2 a cdot 2017+2 c=0or equivalentlyb+1-2017 a^{2}+a c=0 .Substituting c=2 b-a, we getb+1-2017 a^{2}+2 a b-a^{2}=0,and sob=frac{2018 a^{2}-1}{2 a+1}=frac{(2 a+1)(1009 a-1)-1007 a}{2 a+1}=1009 a-1-frac{1007 a}{2 a+1} .Now, b is integer, so frac{1007 a}{2 a+1} must be integer. Since operatorname{gcd}(a, 2 a+1)=1,2 a+1 must be a factor of 1007=19 times 53, and so a=9, a=26 or a=503. The smallest value is a=9.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-a16c1816 data-v-8995579a><div class="review" data-v-8995579a><div class="review-title" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>❓:</span>Example 4 (Canadian Mathematics Competition) Let the set T be the set of all positive divisors of 2004^{100}.

The key condition here is that no element in S should be a multiple of another. Hmm, this seems like an antichain problem in posets, specifically in the divisor lattice. I remember something about Sperner&#39;s theorem, which deals with antichains in the Boolean lattice, but I wonder how that applies here.First, let me factorize 2004 to understand its prime components. 2004 divided by 2 is 1002, divided by 2 again is 501. Then 501 divided by 3 is 167. 167 is a prime number. So, 2004 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 167^1. Therefore, 2004^100 would be (2^2 * 3 * 167)^100 = 2^(200) * 3^(100) * 167^(100). So, the prime factorization of 2004^100 is 2^200 * 3^100 * 167^100. Therefore, any divisor of 2004^100 will be of the form 2^a * 3^b * 167^c where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b ≤ 100, and 0 ≤ c ≤ 100. So, the problem reduces to finding the largest antichain in the poset of divisors of 2^200 * 3^100 * 167^100. Since each divisor is determined by the exponents (a, b, c), this is equivalent to finding the largest antichain in the grid [0, 200] × [0, 100] × [0, 100] under the component-wise ordering. In Sperner theory, for a product of chains, the size of the largest antichain can sometimes be found using the theorem of de Bruijn, Tengbergen, and Kruyswijk, which states that for the product of chains of lengths n1, n2, ..., nk, the largest antichain is formed by the middle layer(s). However, this is when all chains are symmetric. But here, the exponents for 2 is 200, which is even, and for 3 and 167 are 100 each, which is even for 3 and 167? Wait, 100 is even. Wait, no, the exponents can be from 0 up to 200, 100, 100. So the lengths of the chains would be 201, 101, 101. So the poset is a three-dimensional grid with dimensions 201, 101, 101. The theorem says that in such a case, the largest antichain is the set of elements with total rank equal to the floor of (n1 + n2 + n3 - 3)/2 or something like that? Wait, no, actually, for the product of chains, the maximum antichain is the set of elements with middle rank. But I need to recall the exact statement. Alternatively, maybe using Dilworth&#39;s theorem? But Dilworth&#39;s applies to general posets and states that the size of the largest antichain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset. But I don&#39;t know if that helps here directly. Wait, for the case of a three-dimensional grid (a product of three chains), the maximum antichain is indeed given by the set of elements with coordinates (a, b, c) such that a + b + c is equal to some constant. But which constant? For symmetric cases, the middle layer. Let me see. In the original Sperner&#39;s theorem, which is for the Boolean lattice (a product of two-element chains), the largest antichain is the middle layer. For the case of a product of three chains of different lengths, the maximum antichain might be more complicated. The theorem by de Bruijn, Tengbergen, and Kruyswijk says that for the product of chains, the maximum antichain is either the middle layer or near the middle. But in three dimensions, this might require more careful analysis. Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the divisor lattice. Each divisor is a triple (a, b, c) where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b ≤ 100, 0 ≤ c ≤ 100. The partial order is component-wise ≤. An antichain here is a set of triples where no one is component-wise ≤ another. To find the maximum antichain, we can use the idea of the LYM inequality, which in the Boolean lattice gives that the size of the antichain is at most the largest binomial coefficient. For multi-dimensional grids, there is a similar concept. The maximum antichain is the set of elements with the maximal number of elements, which is equivalent to the set of elements where the sum of their coordinates is as close as possible to the average. Wait, in the three-dimensional grid, each element (a, b, c) has a rank r = a + b + c. The number of elements with rank r is the number of solutions to a + b + c = r with 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. But perhaps the maximum antichain is the set of elements whose rank is around (200 + 100 + 100)/2 = 200. Wait, that&#39;s an interesting thought. If we model this as a three-dimensional grid, then the maximum antichain should lie around the middle layer. The middle layer would correspond to the rank where the sum a + b + c is equal to half of the maximum possible sum. The maximum possible sum is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. Half of that is 200. So the middle layer is the set of triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 200. But wait, the number of elements in this layer might be the largest. But let&#39;s verify this. Let me see. For each prime factor, we have exponents a, b, c. The divisor is 2^a * 3^b * 167^c. The total number of divisors is (200 + 1)(100 + 1)(100 + 1) = 201*101*101. But we need to find the size of the largest antichain. If we consider the poset as a grid with coordinates (a, b, c), then the poset is a three-dimensional grid with side lengths 201, 101, 101. The theorem by de Bruijn, Tengbergen, and Kruyswijk states that in such a grid, the largest antichain is formed by the middle layer(s). Specifically, the size of the largest antichain is equal to the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c is equal to floor((200 + 100 + 100)/2) or ceil((200 + 100 + 100)/2). Since 200 + 100 + 100 = 400, half of that is 200. So the middle layer is exactly the set of triples where a + b + c = 200. Therefore, the size of the largest antichain is equal to the number of solutions (a, b, c) with a ≤ 200, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100, and a + b + c = 200. So now, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 200 with a ≤ 200, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100. Let&#39;s compute this. Wait, without the constraints b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100, the number of solutions would be C(200 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(202, 2) = 202*201/2 = 20301. But we have the constraints that b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100. So we need to subtract the solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. This is a classic stars and bars problem with restrictions. Let me recall inclusion-exclusion. Let S be the total number of solutions without constraints: C(202, 2). Let A be the set of solutions where b &gt; 100, and B be the set where c &gt; 100. We need to compute |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. Then the desired number is S - |A ∪ B|. First, compute |A|: the number of solutions where b ≥ 101. Let b&#39; = b - 101, then the equation becomes a + b&#39; + c = 200 - 101 = 99, with a ≥ 0, b&#39; ≥ 0, c ≥ 0. The number of solutions is C(99 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(101, 2) = 101*100/2 = 5050. Similarly, |B| is also 5050. Now, |A ∩ B|: the number of solutions where b ≥ 101 and c ≥ 101. Let b&#39; = b - 101, c&#39; = c - 101. Then the equation becomes a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 200 - 101 - 101 = -2. But this is impossible, as a, b&#39;, c&#39; are non-negative integers. So |A ∩ B| = 0. Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 5050 + 5050 - 0 = 10100. Thus, the number of solutions with b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100 is S - |A ∪ B| = 20301 - 10100 = 10201. Therefore, the number of elements in the middle layer (a + b + c = 200) is 10,201. So, according to the theorem, this should be the maximum antichain size. But wait, let me check if there are any other layers near 200 that might have a larger number of elements. For example, layers 199 or 201. Let&#39;s see. First, note that the total sum ranges from 0 (when a = b = c = 0) to 200 + 100 + 100 = 400 (when a = 200, b = 100, c = 100). The middle is at 200. The number of elements at layer r is equal to the number of solutions to a + b + c = r with 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. To check if layer 200 is indeed the maximum, let&#39;s see how the number of solutions changes as r increases. For small r, the number increases until it reaches the middle, then decreases. But in this case, due to the constraints on a, b, c, the symmetry might not hold. Wait, but in the theorem, they state that for such product posets, the sequence of the number of elements in each layer is symmetric and unimodal. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the middle layer. So, since 400 is even, the middle layer is exactly at 200, and the number of elements would be symmetric around 200. So, for example, layer 200 - k and layer 200 + k would have the same number of elements. But in our case, due to the upper bounds on a, b, c, this symmetry might not hold? Wait, if r is 200 - k, then the upper bounds might not interfere, but for r = 200 + k, the upper bounds on a, b, c might start limiting the number of solutions. Wait, but the maximum possible r is 400, so layers from 0 to 400. But due to the upper bounds, the actual number of solutions for r &gt; 200 + 100 + 100 - (the minimal exponents). Wait, no. Actually, given that a can be up to 200, and b, c up to 100, the maximum sum is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. For sums near 400, the number of solutions would start decreasing. But since we are starting from 0 and going up to 400, the number of solutions increases up to the middle and then decreases. However, in our case, due to the different upper limits on a, b, and c, the middle layer at 200 might actually not be the peak. Wait, let me think. For example, if we fix a, the maximum sum for b + c is 200, but a can go up to 200. If we consider layers where a is large, then even if b and c are small, the sum can be large. But in our problem, the antichain is about elements where no one is a multiple of another, which corresponds to the coordinate-wise order. But perhaps in this problem, the maximum antichain is not the middle layer. Wait, I need to recall the theorem properly. The de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem says that for a product of chains, the maximum antichain is the set of elements with ranks as close as possible to the average. In particular, if the poset is a product of k chains of lengths n1, n2, ..., nk, then the maximum antichain is the set of elements whose ranks are floor((sum ni - k)/2) or ceil((sum ni - k)/2). Wait, let me check. The rank of an element (a1, a2, ..., ak) where 0 ≤ ai ≤ ni is the sum a1 + a2 + ... + ak. The theorem says that the maximum antichain is formed by the middle layer(s). In our case, the lengths of the chains are 201 (for exponent 2), 101 (for exponent 3), and 101 (for exponent 167). The sum of the lengths is 201 + 101 + 101 = 403. Then the average rank would be (403 - 3)/2 = 200. So the middle layer is at rank 200. Therefore, the theorem would state that the maximum antichain is the set of elements with rank 200. But wait, the chain lengths are n1 = 201, n2 = 101, n3 = 101. Then the maximum element in the poset has rank (201 - 1) + (101 - 1) + (101 - 1) = 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. So the middle rank is 200. So the theorem would say that the maximum antichain is the set of elements with rank 200. Therefore, according to the theorem, the number we computed earlier, 10,201, should be the maximum antichain. But let me verify this with an example. Suppose instead of 2004^100, take a simpler number, like 2^2 * 3^1. So T is divisors of 2^2 * 3^1, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The poset is a 3x2 grid. The antichains: the largest antichain here is size 2 (e.g., {4, 3} or {6, 4} etc.), but according to the theorem, the middle rank is (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5, so layers 1 and 2. Wait, but the maximum antichain here is actually size 3: {4, 3, 2} but wait no, 2 divides 4 and 6. Wait, maybe {3, 4, 6} is an antichain? No, 3 divides 6. Wait, actually in this case, the maximum antichain is size 2. Hmm. So perhaps the theorem still holds. Wait, the theorem in two dimensions: for a product of a chain of length m and a chain of length n, the maximum antichain is min(m, n). Wait, in this case, the poset is 3x2 (since exponents go from 0 to 2 and 0 to 1). Then the maximum antichain is 2, which matches min(3, 2) = 2. But in our case, the three-dimensional grid. Wait, maybe in three dimensions, the maximum antichain is the middle layer. Let me take another example. Suppose we have 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. The poset is a cube. The largest antichain here is size 3 (e.g., {2, 3, 5}), but according to the theorem, the middle layer is at rank floor((1 + 1 + 1)/2) = 1, which has 3 elements. So it works here. Another example: 2^2 * 3^1. The poset is 3x2, as before. The middle rank would be (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5, so layers 1 and 2. The number of elements in layer 1 is 2 (2^1, 3^1), layer 2 is 2 (2^2, 2^1*3^1). The maximum antichain is 2, which is the size of each layer. Wait, but in the first example with 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1, the middle layer is indeed the largest antichain. So perhaps in three dimensions, the theorem holds. Therefore, returning to the original problem, the maximum antichain is the middle layer, which is 200. And the number of elements in that layer is 10,201. Therefore, the answer should be 10,201. But let me verify the calculation once more. Total solutions without constraints: C(200 + 2, 2) = C(202, 2) = 202*201 / 2 = 20301. Subtract solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then a + b&#39; + c = 99. Solutions: C(99 + 2, 2) = C(101, 2) = 5050. Similarly for c &gt; 100. Intersection of b &gt; 100 and c &gt; 100: a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 200 - 101 - 101 = -2. Impossible, so 0. Thus, total solutions with b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100: 20301 - 2*5050 = 20301 - 10100 = 10201. Yes, that seems correct. So 10,201 is the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 200, 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. Therefore, according to the theorem, this is the maximum antichain. But to make sure there isn&#39;t a larger antichain elsewhere, perhaps I should check layers near 200. For example, layer 199. How many elements would that have? For layer 199, the number of solutions is C(199 + 2, 2) - corrections for b and c exceeding 100. Wait, but actually, for layer 199, the equation is a + b + c = 199. Similarly, the number of solutions without constraints is C(199 + 2, 2) = C(201, 2) = 201*200 / 2 = 20100. Then subtract the solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then a + b&#39; + c = 199 - 101 = 98. The number of solutions is C(98 + 2, 2) = C(100, 2) = 4950. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 4950. Again, intersection: a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 199 - 101 - 101 = -3, impossible. So total solutions with b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100: 20100 - 2*4950 = 20100 - 9900 = 10200. So layer 199 has 10,200 elements, which is one less than layer 200. Similarly, layer 201: equation a + b + c = 201. Number of solutions without constraints: C(201 + 2, 2) = C(203, 2) = 203*202 / 2 = 20503. Subtract solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 101: Wait, let&#39;s be precise. For layer 201: a + b + c = 201. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, so a + b&#39; + c = 201 - 101 = 100. Number of solutions: C(100 + 2, 2) = C(102, 2) = 102*101 / 2 = 5151. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 5151. Intersection: a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 201 - 101 - 101 = -1, impossible. So total solutions: 20503 - 2*5151 = 20503 - 10302 = 10201. Wait, so layer 201 also has 10,201 elements. Interesting. So layers 200 and 201 both have 10,201 elements. But how is that possible? Wait, because the total sum is 400, which is even. So the middle is at 200. But the theorem says that when the total is even, there&#39;s a single middle layer. However, here, due to the upper bounds on the exponents, the layers 200 and 201 both have the same number of elements. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, but when we calculated for layer 201, we had to subtract 2*5151 from 20503, which gave 10201, same as layer 200. So perhaps in this case, layers 200 and 201 have the same number of elements. Hmm. Therefore, the maximum antichain might actually be the combination of layers 200 and 201? But no, because elements from layer 200 and 201 could be comparable. For example, an element in layer 200 (a, b, c) and an element in layer 201 (a + 1, b, c) would be comparable. Therefore, we can&#39;t take both layers. So we have to take only one of them. Therefore, each of layers 200 and 201 has 10,201 elements, but they cannot be combined. Therefore, the maximum antichain is 10,201. But wait, actually, wait. Let me check for layer 201. The problem is that for some elements in layer 201, they might exceed the maximum exponents for b and c. For example, if a = 200, then b + c = 1, which is okay. But if a is, say, 150, then b + c = 51, which is also okay. But when a is low, like 100, then b + c = 101. However, since b and c can only go up to 100, in this case, the maximum b + c is 200 (if a=0), but in layer 201, a + b + c = 201, so if a is 0, then b + c = 201, but since b and c are each at most 100, this is impossible. Wait, so actually in layer 201, when a is small, like a=0, then b + c = 201, but since b and c can&#39;t exceed 100, this is impossible. Therefore, in layer 201, the possible values of a must satisfy a ≥ 201 - 100 - 100 = 1. So a ≥ 1. Wait, but when we did the inclusion-exclusion earlier, we accounted for that by subtracting the cases where b or c exceeded 100. So the count of 10,201 for layer 201 is correct. So, in effect, both layers 200 and 201 have 10,201 elements. However, since they are adjacent layers, elements from layer 200 could be less than elements in layer 201. So combining them would not form an antichain. Therefore, the maximum antichain is indeed 10,201. But wait, if layers 200 and 201 have the same size, does that mean that there is another antichain of size 10,201 in layer 201? But since we can&#39;t combine them, the maximum is still 10,201. Therefore, according to the theorem and calculations, the maximum antichain has 10,201 elements. But just to make sure, let&#39;s check a different layer. For example, layer 150. How many elements would that have? Well, it&#39;s tedious, but let&#39;s see. The number of solutions to a + b + c = 150. Without constraints, it&#39;s C(150 + 2, 2) = C(152, 2) = 152*151 / 2 = 11476. Then subtract the solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then a + b&#39; + c = 150 - 101 = 49. Number of solutions: C(49 + 2, 2) = C(51, 2) = 51*50 / 2 = 1275. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 1275. Intersection: b &gt; 100 and c &gt; 100, then a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 150 - 101 - 101 = -52. Impossible. So total solutions: 11476 - 2*1275 = 11476 - 2550 = 8926. Which is less than 10,201. Similarly, layer 250. a + b + c = 250. Without constraints, C(250 + 2, 2) = C(252, 2) = 252*251 / 2 = 31878. Subtract solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then a + b&#39; + c = 250 - 101 = 149. Solutions: C(149 + 2, 2) = C(151, 2) = 151*150 / 2 = 11325. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 11325. Intersection: a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 250 - 101 - 101 = 48. So solutions: C(48 + 2, 2) = C(50, 2) = 1225. So |A ∩ B| = 1225. Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 11325 + 11325 - 1225 = 21425. So total solutions: 31878 - 21425 = 10453. Wait, that&#39;s more than 10,201. Wait, what&#39;s happening here? Wait, layer 250: a + b + c = 250. But the maximum possible a is 200, so even if b and c are 100 each, a would be 250 - 100 - 100 = 50. So a can be up to 200, but here, a is 50 at maximum? Wait, no. Wait, if a can be up to 200, then if a is 200, then b + c = 50. But b and c can each be up to 100. So 50 can be split as b=0, c=50 up to b=50, c=0. So in this case, there is no constraint on b and c for layer 250. Wait, but when we calculated the number of solutions with b &lt;=100 and c &lt;=100, we got 10,453. But how is that possible? Wait, the total number of solutions without constraints is C(250 + 2, 2). But when we subtract |A ∪ B|, which is 21,425, from 31,878, we get 10,453. But in reality, for layer 250, since a can be up to 200, and b, c up to 100, we need to ensure that in a + b + c = 250, even though a can be up to 200, but when a is 200, b + c = 50, which is allowed. When a is 150, b + c = 100, which is allowed. When a is 100, b + c = 150. Now, since b and c are each limited to 100, this requires that neither b nor c exceeds 100. But 150 can be split as b=100, c=50, which is allowed, or b=50, c=100, etc. So in this case, even though b + c = 150, since each is at most 100, there are solutions. However, when a is less than 150, say a=140, then b + c = 110, which can be split as b=100, c=10 or c=100, b=10. So again, possible. But if a is too low, like a=0, then b + c = 250, which is impossible since b and c can each be at most 100. Therefore, in layer 250, a has to be at least 250 - 100 - 100 = 50. So a &gt;= 50. But the calculation we did with inclusion-exclusion gives 10,453. But how does that compare to layer 200&#39;s 10,201? Wait, 10,453 is larger. But according to the theorem, the middle layer should have the maximum number of elements. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the theorem doesn&#39;t apply here because the poset is not symmetric? Wait, the theorem applies to the product of chains, regardless of their lengths, but the maximum antichain is the set of elements with rank as close as possible to the average. Wait, in this case, the average rank would be (0 + 400)/2 = 200. So layers around 200 should have the maximum number of elements. But according to this calculation, layer 250 has more elements. That doesn&#39;t make sense. There must be an error in the calculation. Wait, let&#39;s recalculate layer 250. The equation is a + b + c = 250, with 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. First, the total number of solutions without constraints is C(250 + 2, 2) = C(252, 2) = 252*251/2 = 31878. Now, subtract the solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, so a + b&#39; + c = 250 - 101 = 149. The number of solutions is C(149 + 2, 2) = C(151, 2) = 151*150/2 = 11325. Similarly, for c &gt; 100: 11325. Intersection: both b &gt; 100 and c &gt; 100. Then set b&#39; = b - 101, c&#39; = c - 101, so a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 250 - 101 - 101 = 48. The number of solutions is C(48 + 2, 2) = C(50, 2) = 50*49/2 = 1225. Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 11325 + 11325 - 1225 = 21425. Thus, the number of solutions with b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100 is 31878 - 21425 = 10453. But this is larger than layer 200&#39;s 10,201. This suggests that the maximum antichain is actually at layer 250. But that contradicts the theorem. What&#39;s going on here? Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding of the theorem. The theorem states that in the product of chains, the maximum antichain is the middle layer, but maybe when the poset is not symmetric, the maximum antichain can shift. Wait, but in our case, the poset is a three-dimensional grid with different lengths. The theorem by de Bruijn, Tengbergen, and Kruyswijk actually states that in the grid [1, m] × [1, n] × [1, p], the maximum antichain is the set of elements with the middle rank. But when the grid is not symmetric, the middle rank may not correspond to the arithmetic mean. Wait, let me check the original theorem. According to the theorem, in a product of chains of lengths n1, n2, ..., nk, the maximum antichain is formed by the set of elements whose coordinates sum to a certain value. For three-dimensional case, if the chains have lengths l, m, n, then the maximum antichain is formed by the set of triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c is equal to floor((l + m + n - 3)/2) or ceil((l + m + n - 3)/2). Wait, in our case, the chains have lengths 201, 101, 101 (since exponents go from 0 to 200, 0 to 100, 0 to 100). The sum of the lengths is 201 + 101 + 101 = 403. Then, (403 - 3)/2 = 200. Therefore, the middle rank is 200, so the maximum antichain is at rank 200. But in our calculation, the number of elements at rank 200 is 10,201, and at rank 250 is 10,453, which is larger. So this contradicts the theorem. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the application of the theorem. Let me check the exact statement. From the original paper (though I can&#39;t access it right now), the theorem states that for the grid [1, a] × [1, b] × [1, c], the maximum antichain is formed by the middle layer. The number of elements in each layer increases up to the middle layer and then decreases. But in our case, the grid is [0, 200] × [0, 100] × [0, 100], which is equivalent to [1, 201] × [1, 101] × [1, 101]. So the lengths are 201, 101, 101. Then, the middle rank is (201 + 101 + 101 - 3)/2 = (300)/2 = 150. Wait, no. Wait, if we take the poset as [1, m] × [1, n] × [1, p], then the maximum rank is m + n + p - 3. The middle would be (m + n + p - 3)/2. Wait, in the original problem, the maximum rank is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. So the middle is 200. But if the theorem states that the maximum antichain is at floor((m + n + p - 3)/2), which would be floor((201 + 101 + 101 - 3)/2) = floor((400 - 3)/2) = floor(397/2) = 198.5, so 198 or 199. Wait, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the theorem uses a different definition of rank. If in the grid [1, m] × [1, n] × [1, p], each element&#39;s rank is the sum of its coordinates. Then, the maximum rank is m + n + p - 3. The middle rank is (m + n + p - 3)/2. So, for example, in our case, maximum rank is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. Middle rank is 200. But in another source, when I look up the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, it says that in the poset of divisors of a number (which is a product of chains), the maximum size antichain is the set of divisors with a number of prime factors (counting multiplicity) equal to floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2), where n is the total number of prime factors. Wait, but in our case, the number of prime factors with multiplicity is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. So floor(400/2) = 200. So the maximum antichain is the set of divisors with exactly 200 prime factors, counting multiplicity. But each prime factor here is 2, 3, or 167. So, the number of divisors with exactly 200 2s, 100 3s, and 100 167s is not possible. Wait, no. Each divisor is formed by the exponents a, b, c. The total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) is a + b + c. So yes, the maximum antichain is the set of divisors with a + b + c = 200, which matches our previous result. Therefore, according to the theorem, the maximum antichain is at 200. But why does layer 250 have a larger number of elements? Is there a mistake in my calculation for layer 250? Wait, let&#39;s see. For layer 250: a + b + c = 250, with 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. But if a is at most 200, then b + c = 250 - a. The minimum value of b + c is 250 - 200 = 50, and the maximum is 250 - 0 = 250. But since b and c are each limited to 100, the maximum possible b + c is 200. Therefore, for a &lt; 50, we get b + c &gt; 200, which is impossible. Therefore, in layer 250, a must be ≥ 50. But when we calculated the number of solutions with a ≥ 0, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100, we subtracted the cases where b or c exceeded 100, which should account for the a &lt; 50. Wait, no. The inclusion-exclusion subtracts cases where b or c exceed 100, regardless of a. But in reality, when a is between 50 and 200, then b + c ranges from 50 to 200. For a ≥ 50, b + c = 250 - a ≤ 200. Therefore, in these cases, b and c can each go up to 100. So the constraints b ≤ 100 and c ≤ 100 are automatically satisfied when a ≥ 50. Therefore, the number of solutions with a ≥ 50, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100 is equal to the number of solutions to a + b + c = 250 with 50 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. But how does that relate to the inclusion-exclusion count? Wait, the inclusion-exclusion subtracts all solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100, regardless of a. But when a is ≥ 50, those solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100 are already invalid because a + b + c = 250, and a is at least 50. Wait, no. If a is 50, then b + c = 200. Then b can be 100, c=100, which is valid. If b exceeds 100, say b=101, then c=200 - 101 = 99, which is valid. Wait, no: if a=50, then b + c = 200. If b=101, then c=200 - 101 = 99, which is still allowed (c=99 ≤ 100). So even with a=50, we can have b=101, but since b is limited to 100, such solutions are invalid. Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion is necessary even when a ≥ 50. But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, we can model the problem as a three-dimensional grid and use generating functions. The generating function for the exponents of 2 is 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^200. For 3 and 167, it&#39;s 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^100 each. The generating function for the entire poset is (1 + x + ... + x^200)(1 + x + ... + x^100)^2. The coefficient of x^r in this product gives the number of elements in layer r. To find the maximum coefficient, which corresponds to the largest antichain. According to the theorem, this maximum occurs at r = 200. However, our calculation for r=250 gave a larger coefficient, which contradicts this. But perhaps there is a mistake in the calculation for layer 250. Let me verify using generating functions. The generating function is:GF(x) = (1 - x^201)/(1 - x) * [(1 - x^101)/(1 - x)]^2= (1 - x^201)(1 - x^101)^2 / (1 - x)^3We are interested in the coefficients of x^r in this expansion. The coefficient of x^r in GF(x) is equal to the number of triples (a, b, c) with 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100, and a + b + c = r. To find the maximum coefficient, we can consider the convolution of the coefficients. However, this is non-trivial. Alternatively, using the principle that the product of symmetric unimodal polynomials is also symmetric and unimodal. But since our generating functions are truncated (not full geometric series), the resulting coefficients might not be symmetric. However, the original theorem by de Bruijn et al. states that even in truncated cases, the maximum antichain is the middle layer. So why does our calculation for layer 250 show a higher number? Wait, perhaps there is a miscalculation. Let&#39;s recalculate the number of elements in layer 250. First, the total number of solutions to a + b + c = 250 without constraints is C(250 + 2, 2) = 252*251/2 = 31878. Now, subtract the solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then equation becomes a + b&#39; + c = 250 - 101 = 149. The number of solutions is C(149 + 2, 2) = 151*150/2 = 11325. Similarly, for c &gt; 100: 11325. Intersection where both b &gt; 100 and c &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, c&#39; = c - 101, then equation becomes a + b&#39; + c&#39; = 250 - 101 - 101 = 48. Number of solutions: C(48 + 2, 2) = 50*49/2 = 1225. Therefore, |A ∪ B| = 11325 + 11325 - 1225 = 21425. Thus, the number of valid solutions is 31878 - 21425 = 10453. Similarly, for layer 200: Total solutions: C(200 + 2, 2) = 202*201/2 = 20301. Subtract solutions where b &gt; 100: C(99 + 2, 2) = 101*100/2 = 5050. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 5050. Intersection: impossible, so total subtract 10100. Thus, valid solutions: 20301 - 10100 = 10201. So, layer 250 has more elements than layer 200. This seems to contradict the theorem. But wait, according to the theorem, in the poset of divisors of N, where N has prime factorization with exponents, the maximum antichain is formed by the divisors with the middle number of prime factors. In this case, N = 2^200 * 3^100 * 167^100. The total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) in N is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. Therefore, the middle number is 200, which corresponds to the divisors with exactly 200 prime factors. So this is the layer 200. But according to the calculation, layer 250 has more elements. This suggests a conflict between the theorem and the actual calculation. Where is the mistake? Ah, here&#39;s the key point. The theorem assumes that the poset is a product of chains, which it is. But the theorem states that the maximum antichain is the middle layer. However, in our case, the middle layer is 200, but layer 250 has a larger number of elements. This inconsistency must be due to a miscalculation. Wait, no. Wait, in the theorem, the poset is considered as a ranked poset where the rank function is the sum of the coordinates. However, when there are upper bounds on the coordinates, the poset is no longer symmetric, and the number of elements in higher layers can decrease slower or even increase beyond the middle. Wait, this is possible. For example, if we have a poset that is a product of chains with different lengths, the number of elements in layers can increase past the middle due to the constraints. However, according to the theorem, even with upper bounds, the largest antichain is still the middle layer. But according to our calculations, layer 250 has more elements. This suggests that either the theorem has additional conditions, or our calculation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the theorem is applicable only when the poset is graded and the ranks are symmetric, which is not the case here. Wait, let me check an example from the original paper. Suppose we have a poset which is a product of three chains of lengths 2, 2, 2. Then the maximum antichain is the middle layer, which is rank 3, with 6 elements. But if we have chains of different lengths, say 3, 2, 2, then the middle layer is (3 + 2 + 2 - 3)/2 = 2, and the number of elements in layer 2 would be... Well, need to compute. But perhaps in our case, the theorem might not directly apply because the poset is not symmetric. Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the three exponents a, b, c. Each exponent has a different maximum. The key is to find the largest antichain in this poset. An alternative approach is to use the concept of shadow and shade. For a ranked poset, the size of the largest antichain is equal to the maximum layer size. However, if the poset is not unimodal, this might not hold. But in our case, the poset might not be unimodal due to the different chain lengths. Alternatively, we can use the three-dimensional version of Sperner&#39;s theorem, which states that the largest antichain in the product of three chains is the set of elements with coordinates as close as possible to the middle. But in practice, when the chains have different lengths, the largest antichain might not be the exact middle layer. Given that in our calculation, layers 200 and 250 have sizes 10,201 and 10,453 respectively, but according to the theorem, it should be layer 200. This suggests that there is a mistake in the application of the theorem or in the calculation. Wait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the theorem applies to the poset with elements (a, b, c). But in reality, the poset of divisors ordered by divisibility is isomorphic to the product of chains ordered component-wise. Therefore, the theorem should apply. But why then layer 250 has more elements? Maybe because of the different upper bounds, the poset is not symmetric, leading to the largest antichain not being at the middle. Alternatively, the original theorem might require that all chains have the same length. But I don&#39;t recall that being a condition. Wait, according to the paper &quot;On the set of divisors of a number&quot; by de Bruijn et al., they consider the case of a number with prime factors, not necessarily all with the same exponents. They show that the maximum antichain is the set of divisors with floor(n/2) or ceil(n/2) prime factors, where n is the total number of prime factors of N. In our case, N has 400 prime factors (with multiplicity). Therefore, the maximum antichain is the set of divisors with 200 prime factors. Which corresponds to a + b + c = 200. Therefore, according to the theorem, the maximum antichain is layer 200 with 10,201 elements. Thus, the calculation showing layer 250 has more elements must be wrong. Where is the error? Wait, when we compute layer 250, we have to take into account that a cannot exceed 200. But in the inclusion-exclusion calculation, we accounted for b and c exceeding 100, but not a. However, the original equation a + b + c = 250 with a ≤ 200, b, c ≤ 100. So when a is less than 50, a + b + c = 250 would require b + c &gt; 200, which is impossible since b and c are limited to 100 each. Therefore, in reality, a must be at least 50. So the correct number of solutions should be the number of solutions to a + b + c = 250 with 50 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. To compute this, we can make a substitution: let a&#39; = a - 50. Then a&#39; + b + c = 200, with 0 ≤ a&#39; ≤ 150, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. Now, the number of solutions is the number of solutions to a&#39; + b + c = 200 with a&#39; ≤ 150, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100. Which is similar to our original problem but with a&#39; ≤ 150. Using inclusion-exclusion: Total solutions without constraints: C(200 + 2, 2) = 201*200/2 = 20100. Subtract solutions where a&#39; &gt; 150: set a&#39;&#39; = a&#39; - 151, then a&#39;&#39; + b + c = 200 - 151 = 49. Number of solutions: C(49 + 2, 2) = 51*50/2 = 1275. Subtract solutions where b &gt; 100 or c &gt; 100. For b &gt; 100: set b&#39; = b - 101, then a&#39; + b&#39; + c = 200 - 101 = 99. Number of solutions: C(99 + 2, 2) = 101*100/2 = 5050. Similarly for c &gt; 100: 5050. Intersection of b &gt; 100 and c &gt; 100: a&#39; + b&#39; + c&#39; = 200 - 101 - 101 = -2. Impossible. Intersection of a&#39; &gt; 150 and b &gt; 100: a&#39;&#39; + b&#39; + c = 49 - 101 = negative. Impossible. Similarly for other intersections. Therefore, total solutions: 20100 - 1275 - 5050 - 5050 = 20100 - 11375 = 8725. Wait, but this contradicts our previous result of 10,453. So where is the mistake? The mistake was in the initial approach where we considered a + b + c = 250 with a ≥ 0, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100, but failed to account for the fact that a cannot exceed 200. When we set a&#39; = a - 50, we reframed the problem to a&#39; + b + c = 200 with a&#39; ≤ 150. This is different from the previous inclusion-exclusion which didn&#39;t consider the upper bound on a. Therefore, the correct number of solutions for layer 250 is 8,725, which is less than 10,201. Therefore, the maximum antichain is indeed layer 200. Therefore, my earlier calculation for layer 250 was incorrect because I didn&#39;t consider the upper bound on a. The correct way is to substitute a&#39; = a - 50 and then apply inclusion-exclusion for a&#39; ≤ 150, which results in 8,725 solutions. Therefore, the maximum antichain is indeed layer 200 with 10,201 elements. This shows that when dealing with multiple constraints, we have to be careful to consider all upper and lower bounds. Initially, I forgot that a cannot exceed 200 when calculating layer 250, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the final answer is 10,201. Final Answerboxed{10201}&lt;/think&gt;To find the maximum possible number of elements in a subset ( S ) of ( T ), where ( T ) is the set of all positive divisors of ( 2004^{100} ) and no element in ( S ) is a multiple of another, we start by factorizing ( 2004 ). The prime factorization of ( 2004 ) is ( 2^2 times 3 times 167 ). Therefore, ( 2004^{100} = 2^{200} times 3^{100} times 167^{100} ). Any divisor of ( 2004^{100} ) can be written as ( 2^a times 3^b times 167^c ) where ( 0 leq a leq 200 ), ( 0 leq b leq 100 ), and ( 0 leq c leq 100 ).The problem reduces to finding the largest antichain in the poset of divisors of ( 2^{200} times 3^{100} times 167^{100} ). According to the theorem by de Bruijn, Tengbergen, and Kruyswijk, the largest antichain in a product of chains is the middle layer. For the given problem, the middle layer corresponds to the set of divisors with the sum of exponents ( a + b + c ) equal to 200.To find the number of such divisors, we solve the equation ( a + b + c = 200 ) with the constraints ( 0 leq a leq 200 ), ( 0 leq b leq 100 ), and ( 0 leq c leq 100 ). Using inclusion-exclusion principle:1. Total solutions without constraints: ( binom{200 + 2}{2} = binom{202}{2} = 20301 ).2. Subtract solutions where ( b &gt; 100 ): ( binom{99 + 2}{2} = binom{101}{2} = 5050 ).3. Subtract solutions where ( c &gt; 100 ): Similarly, 5050.4. Intersection of ( b &gt; 100 ) and ( c &gt; 100 ) is impossible, so no subtraction needed here.The number of valid solutions is ( 20301 - 2 times 5050 = 20301 - 10100 = 10201 ).Thus, the maximum number of elements in such a subset ( S ) is (boxed{10201}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum size of a subset S of the divisors of 2004^100 where no element in S is a multiple of another. Hmm, this sounds like an anti-chain problem. I remember something about Sperner&#39;s theorem, which deals with the largest anti-chain in the power set of a set. Maybe that applies here? But first, let me recall the problem structure.First, factorize 2004. Let me do that. 2004 divided by 2 is 1002, divided by 2 again is 501. Then 501 divided by 3 is 167. Is 167 a prime? Let me check. 167 divided by 2 is not, by 3 is 55.666, not. 5? 167/5 is 33.4. 7? 167/7 is about 23.85. 11? 15.18... So yeah, 167 is prime. So 2004 factors into 2^2 * 3^1 * 167^1. Therefore, 2004^100 is (2^2 * 3 * 167)^100 = 2^200 * 3^100 * 167^100. So the divisors of 2004^100 are all numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b * 167^c where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b ≤ 100, 0 ≤ c ≤ 100.So the problem is to find the largest subset S of these triples (a, b, c) such that no element in S is a multiple of another. In terms of exponents, if we have two divisors d = 2^a1 * 3^b1 * 167^c1 and e = 2^a2 * 3^b2 * 167^c2, then e is a multiple of d if and only if a2 ≥ a1, b2 ≥ b1, c2 ≥ c1, and at least one of the inequalities is strict. So S must be an anti-chain in the poset of divisors ordered by divisibility.So the problem reduces to finding the size of the largest anti-chain in the poset which is the product of three chains with lengths 200, 100, and 100. Sperner&#39;s theorem tells us that for the Boolean lattice (which is a product of chains of length 1), the largest anti-chain is the middle layer, which is C(n, floor(n/2)). But for more general posets like products of chains, there is a generalization called the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem. If I remember correctly, this theorem states that the largest anti-chain in the product of chains is the set of elements whose ranks are equal to the middle rank. The rank here would be the sum of the exponents in each coordinate, adjusted by the lengths of the chains.Wait, no. Actually, in the case of the product of chains, the poset is a grid, and the rank function is the sum of the coordinates. For example, if we have three chains of lengths m, n, k, then each element can be represented as (x, y, z) where x ∈ {0,1,...,m}, y ∈ {0,1,...,n}, z ∈ {0,1,...,k}. The rank of an element is x + y + z. Then, the largest anti-chain is the set of elements with rank equal to the middle value. This is analogous to Sperner&#39;s theorem but in three dimensions. However, I might need to confirm the exact statement.Alternatively, another approach is to use Dilworth&#39;s theorem, which states that in any finite poset, the size of the largest anti-chain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset. But I don&#39;t know if that helps here directly because Dilworth&#39;s theorem applies generally, but computing the minimum chain cover might be difficult.Alternatively, maybe using the idea of symmetric chains. For certain posets, like the product of chains, you can decompose them into symmetric chains, and then the largest anti-chain is the number of chains times the size of the middle layer. But I need to recall.Alternatively, I might need to look at the structure of the problem. Let me think. Since the exponents for 2 go up to 200, and for 3 and 167 up to 100, each divisor is determined by (a, b, c) where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. The divisibility condition is component-wise: (a1, b1, c1) ≤ (a2, b2, c2) if a1 ≤ a2, b1 ≤ b2, c1 ≤ c2. So the poset is the product of three chains: one of length 200 and two of length 100.In the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, for the product of chains, the maximum anti-chain is formed by the middle layer. The middle layer is the set of elements where the sum of their coordinates is equal to the floor or ceiling of half the total number of coordinates. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me recall. For the product of chains, the maximum anti-chain is the set of elements with coordinates as close as possible to the middle in each dimension. But when the poset is a product of chains of different lengths, the middle layer is determined by the sum of the coordinates. Wait, no, in the case of a three-dimensional grid, the maximum anti-chain can be found by taking the middle layer in terms of the sum of the coordinates. But I need to verify.Let me try to recall the theorem. The de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem says that for the product of chains of lengths n1, n2, ..., nk, the maximum size of an anti-chain is equal to the number of elements with the middle rank. The rank of an element is the sum of its coordinates. For example, in a three-dimensional grid with dimensions m, n, k, the rank of (a, b, c) is a + b + c. The middle rank is floor((m + n + k)/2). Wait, no, that might not be exactly correct.Wait, perhaps more accurately, the theorem states that the maximum anti-chain is the set of elements whose rank is equal to the median rank. The median rank is the floor or ceiling of (total maximum rank)/2. The total maximum rank here is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400. So the middle rank would be 200. So the largest anti-chain is the set of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 200. Is that correct?Wait, but 200 is half of 400, which is the total maximum rank. So if each element is ranked by a + b + c, then the maximum rank is 200 + 100 + 100 = 400, so the middle rank is 200. Therefore, the largest anti-chain should be the set of elements with rank 200. Then the size of this anti-chain would be the number of solutions to a + b + c = 200 where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100. Wait, but this might not be the case because of the upper bounds on b and c. For example, if we didn&#39;t have upper bounds, the number of solutions would be C(200 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(202, 2). But with the upper bounds on b and c (each ≤ 100), the number is less.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum anti-chain is not exactly the middle layer. Wait, let&#39;s check with a simpler case. Suppose we have two primes, say 2^1 * 3^1, so the divisors are (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). The poset is a 2x2 grid. The largest anti-chain here is size 2, which corresponds to the middle layer (the elements (1,0) and (0,1)), each with rank 1 (since the maximum rank is 2, so middle is 1). So that works.Another example: take 2^2 * 3^1. The divisors are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). The ranks are 0,1,2,1,2,3. The middle ranks are 1 and 2. The largest anti-chain is size 3: the elements (1,0), (0,1), (2,0). Wait, but (2,0) is above (1,0). Wait, so that&#39;s not an anti-chain. Hmm. Wait, in this case, the largest anti-chain is actually the middle layer of rank 1 and 2? Wait, elements of rank 1 are (1,0) and (0,1); elements of rank 2 are (2,0) and (1,1). So if we take all elements of rank 1 and 2, but we need to make sure no two are comparable. For example, (1,0) and (1,1) are comparable, so we can&#39;t take both. Similarly, (0,1) and (1,1) are comparable. So actually, the largest anti-chain here is 2, either the elements of rank 1 or the elements of rank 2. Wait, but wait. In a poset of a 3x2 grid, the maximum anti-chain is 2. But according to Sperner theory, in the product of two chains of lengths m and n, the maximum anti-chain is the number of combinations C(m + n, floor((m + n)/2)). But that&#39;s for the Boolean lattice. Wait, no. Maybe the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem would say that the largest anti-chain is the set of elements with a + b = floor((m + n)/2). For example, in our case, m = 2, n =1, so total rank sum is 3, so floor(3/2) =1. Then the number of elements with a + b =1 is 2 ( (1,0) and (0,1) ). Which is indeed the maximum anti-chain. So in this case, it works.But in another case, suppose we have a 2x2 grid, which is the product of two chains of length 2. Then the maximum anti-chain is 2, but the middle layer (sum = 2) would be (2,0), (1,1), (0,2). But if the grid is 3x3, elements (0,0) to (2,2). The middle rank would be 2, so the number of elements with a + b =2 is 3: (2,0), (1,1), (0,2). But in that poset, the maximum anti-chain is indeed 3. So Sperner&#39;s theorem generalizes here.Therefore, applying this logic, in our original problem, the maximum anti-chain should be the set of triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c is equal to 200 (since the total maximum rank is 400, so half is 200). However, we have constraints: a ≤ 200, b ≤ 100, c ≤ 100. So we need to compute the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = 200 where 0 ≤ a ≤ 200, 0 ≤ b, c ≤ 100.Wait, but 200 is the sum, and since b and c can be at most 100, this complicates things. Let me think. If we didn&#39;t have the upper bounds on b and c, the number of solutions would be C(200 + 3 - 1, 3 -1 ) = C(202, 2) = 201*202/2 = 201*101= 20301. But with the constraints b ≤100 and c ≤100, we need to subtract the solutions where b &gt;100 or c &gt;100.Use inclusion-exclusion. Let’s compute the total number without constraints: 20301.Now, subtract the number of solutions where b ≥101. Let’s set b’ = b -101, so b’ ≥0. Then the equation becomes a + b’ + c = 200 -101 =99. The number of solutions is C(99 +3 -1, 3-1)= C(101,2)= 101*100/2= 5050. Similarly, the number of solutions where c ≥101 is also 5050.Now, add back the number of solutions where both b ≥101 and c ≥101. Set b’=b-101, c’=c-101, then a + b’ + c’=200 -101 -101= -2. But this is negative, so no solutions. So by inclusion-exclusion, the total number is 20301 -5050 -5050 +0= 20301 -10100=10201.Therefore, the number of triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c=200, a ≤200, b ≤100, c ≤100 is 10201.But wait, is this the correct application of the theorem? The de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem says that in the product of chains, the largest anti-chain is the set of elements with the middle rank. So here, since the maximum rank is 400, the middle rank is 200, and the number of elements with rank 200 is 10201. Therefore, according to the theorem, the maximum anti-chain should have size 10201.But wait, let me check with a small example. Suppose we have 2^1 *3^1 *5^1. Then the divisors correspond to triples (a,b,c), 0 ≤a,b,c ≤1. The poset is a 2x2x2 cube. The middle rank is 1.5, but since we have integers, the middle ranks are 1 and 2. Wait, total rank sum is 3, so middle is 1.5. So the theorem would say the largest anti-chain is either rank 1 or 2. The number of elements with rank 1 is 3 ( (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) ) and rank 2 is also 3 ( (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) ). So the maximum anti-chain is size 3, which is correct because in the Boolean lattice, the largest anti-chain is the middle layer. However, in the 2x2x2 cube, the maximum anti-chain is indeed 3. So that works.But in our case, the theorem seems to apply, so the answer should be 10201. But let me check whether there&#39;s any restriction due to the upper limits on a, b, c. For example, in the original problem, a can go up to 200, but b and c up to 100. So the structure is not symmetric. However, according to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, even in the case of different chain lengths, the maximum anti-chain is the middle rank. So as long as the middle rank is attainable within the constraints, it should hold. In our case, since the middle rank is 200, and we can have a=0, b=100, c=100, which sums to 200. So yes, it&#39;s attainable. Therefore, the calculation of 10201 should be correct.But let me think again. Suppose we have exponents a, b, c with a ≤200, b,c ≤100. The middle rank is 200. So if we fix a + b + c =200, then with a up to 200, but b and c up to 100. So for example, if a is 200, then b + c=0, which is possible (b=0, c=0). If a is 100, then b + c=100, with b and c each up to 100. So possible. If a is 0, then b + c=200, but since b and c are capped at 100, this would require b=100 and c=100. Therefore, the only solution when a=0 is (0,100,100). Similarly, when a=1, then b + c=199, but since b and c can be at most 100, so b=100, c=99 or b=99, c=100. So two solutions. Wait, but in general, for a given a, how many (b, c) pairs satisfy b + c =200 -a, with b ≤100, c ≤100.So for a given a, the number of solutions is:If 200 -a ≤100, then b can range from 0 to 200 -a, and c =200 -a -b. But since b and c must be ≤100, if 200 -a ≤100, then 200 -a ≤100 implies a ≥100. Then, for a ≥100, the number of (b, c) pairs is 200 -a +1, since b can be from 0 to 200 -a. However, if 200 -a &gt;100, which is when a &lt;100, then we have the constraints that b ≤100 and c=200 -a -b ≤100. So c ≤100 =&gt; 200 -a -b ≤100 =&gt; b ≥100 -a. But since a &lt;100, 100 -a &gt;0. So b must be between max(0, 100 -a) and 100. But since a &lt;100, 100 -a &gt;0. So the lower bound is 100 -a and upper bound is 100. Therefore, the number of solutions is 100 - (100 -a) +1 = a +1. Wait, let me verify.Let’s take a example. Suppose a=50 (which is &lt;100). Then, b + c =150. But b and c must be ≤100. So the possible values of b are from 50 to 100 (since c=150 -b must be ≤100 =&gt; 150 -b ≤100 =&gt; b ≥50). So b ranges from 50 to 100, which is 51 values. So the number of solutions is 51, which is 50 +1. So indeed, for a &lt;100, the number of (b,c) pairs is a +1.Similarly, when a=99, b +c=101. Then b can range from 1 to 100 (since c=101 -b must be ≤100 =&gt; b ≥1). So number of solutions is 100, which is 99 +1=100. Wait, that&#39;s correct. So for a &lt;100, number of solutions is a +1.For a=100, b +c=100. Then b can range from 0 to100, c=100 -b, so 101 solutions.For a=101, b +c=99. Then b can range from 0 to99, so 100 solutions.Wait, but when a ≥100, the number of solutions is (200 -a) +1. For example, a=100, 200 -100=100, so 101 solutions. a=150, 200 -150=50, so 51 solutions. a=200, 200 -200=0, so 1 solution.Therefore, the total number of solutions is the sum over a from 0 to200 of the number of (b,c) pairs for each a. But due to the constraints, we have different expressions for a &lt;100 and a ≥100.Wait, so total number of solutions is:For a from 0 to99 (100 terms), the number of (b,c) pairs is (a +1). So sum_{a=0}^{99} (a +1) = sum_{k=1}^{100} k = (100)(101)/2 = 5050.For a from100 to200 (101 terms), the number of (b,c) pairs is (200 -a) +1. So sum_{a=100}^{200} (200 -a +1) = sum_{k=0}^{100} (k +1) = sum_{k=1}^{101} k = (101)(102)/2 = 5151.Therefore, total number of solutions is 5050 +5151=10201. Which matches the inclusion-exclusion result. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, according to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, the maximum anti-chain in this poset is 10201 elements.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{10201}.But wait, let me check if there isn&#39;t a larger anti-chain. Suppose we don&#39;t take the middle layer. For example, maybe taking elements where two exponents are at their maximum? But no, because those would be comparable. For example, if we take elements with a=200, b=100, c=0, but such elements would not be comparable if they have different distributions. Wait, but if we fix two exponents to be at their maximum, then the third can vary. For example, a=200, b=100, c can be anything. But then, c varies from 0 to100. However, these elements would not be comparable among themselves because a and b are fixed. Wait, but if we take two different elements (200,100,c1) and (200,100,c2), since c1 ≠ c2, neither is a multiple of the other. Similarly, if we fix a=200, c=100, and vary b. So such a set would have 101 elements (since b can be from0 to100). But 101 is much smaller than 10201. Similarly, if we take elements with a=100, b=100, c=0. But such a set is small. So no, those subsets are too small.Alternatively, maybe take all elements where one of the exponents is fixed. For example, fix a=100, and let b and c vary. Then, since a=100, which is half of 200, and b and c can be up to 100. The number of such elements is 101*101=10201. Wait, that&#39;s the same number as before. But are these elements forming an anti-chain? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we have two elements (100, b1, c1) and (100, b2, c2). If b1 ≤ b2 and c1 ≤ c2, then one would be a multiple of the other. But if we just fix a=100 and take all possible b and c, then some of these elements might still be comparable. For example, (100,50,50) and (100,60,60). Since 50 ≤60 and 50 ≤60, (100,50,50) divides (100,60,60)? Wait, no, because in exponents, divisibility requires each exponent to be less or equal. But since a is fixed at 100, so (100,50,50) and (100,60,60) are not comparable because 50 &lt;60 in both b and c, but the a component is equal. So neither is a multiple of the other. Wait, actually, if two elements have the same a but different b and c, then neither divides the other unless one has both b and c less than or equal. Wait, for example, (100,50,50) and (100,50,60). Here, the first has c=50 and the second has c=60, so the first does not divide the second. Similarly, (100,50,60) and (100,60,50) are incomparable. Therefore, actually, the set of all elements with a=100, and any b,c ≤100 is an anti-chain? Wait, no. Wait, suppose we have (100,50,50) and (100,50,50). They are the same. But distinct elements. Suppose we have (100,50,60) and (100,50,70). Then, since c=60 ≤70, but a and b are equal, so (100,50,60) divides (100,50,70). Therefore, those two elements are comparable. Therefore, the set of all elements with a=100 is not an anti-chain because you can have elements where one component is less and the others are equal.Therefore, to form an anti-chain, you need to ensure that no two elements in the set have one component less than or equal in all exponents. Therefore, fixing a=100 and taking all b and c would not work because of the above example. Therefore, the only way to ensure that no two elements are comparable is to have all elements in the same rank layer, i.e., a + b + c = constant. Because if two elements are in the same rank, then for one to divide the other, all their exponents must be greater or equal, which would require that the other element has a higher rank. Therefore, within a single rank layer, no two elements are comparable. Therefore, the maximum anti-chain is indeed the largest rank layer, which is the middle one.Therefore, the answer should be 10201.Final Answerboxed{10201}&lt;/think&gt;To find the maximum possible number of elements in a subset ( S ) of ( T ) (where ( T ) is the set of all positive divisors of (2004^{100})) such that no element of ( S ) is a multiple of another, we start by factorizing 2004. The prime factorization of 2004 is (2^2 times 3 times 167). Therefore, (2004^{100} = 2^{200} times 3^{100} times 167^{100}). The divisors of (2004^{100}) are of the form (2^a times 3^b times 167^c) where (0 leq a leq 200), (0 leq b leq 100), and (0 leq c leq 100).We need to find the largest anti-chain in this poset. According to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, the largest anti-chain in the product of chains is the set of elements with the middle rank. The rank of an element ((a, b, c)) is the sum (a + b + c). The maximum rank is (200 + 100 + 100 = 400), so the middle rank is 200.We need to count the number of solutions to (a + b + c = 200) with (0 leq a leq 200), (0 leq b leq 100), and (0 leq c leq 100). Using inclusion-exclusion principle:1. The total number of solutions without constraints is (binom{202}{2} = 20301).2. Subtract the number of solutions where (b geq 101). This transforms to (a + b&#39; + c = 99) with (b&#39; = b - 101), giving (binom{101}{2} = 5050).3. Similarly, subtract the number of solutions where (c geq 101), also giving 5050.4. There are no solutions where both (b geq 101) and (c geq 101) because (a + b&#39; + c&#39; = -2) has no solutions.Thus, the number of valid solutions is (20301 - 5050 - 5050 = 10201).Therefore, the maximum number of elements in such a subset ( S ) is (boxed{10201}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8995579a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>🔑:</span>Analyzing that if a number is a multiple of another number, then in the standard factorization, the exponent of each prime factor is not less than the corresponding prime factor&#39;s exponent of the other number, we seek a solution by standardly decomposing 2004.Solution: Let a, b, c be non-negative integers.

First, the problem says that m is equal to 3 times the integral from 0 to π of sin x dx. Then, using that value of m, we need to find the coefficient of the term ab²c^(m-3) in the expansion of (a + 2b - 3c)^m. Alright, let&#39;s start with the integral to find m.So, the integral of sin x from 0 to π. Hmm. The integral of sin x is -cos x, right? So, evaluating from 0 to π, that would be -cos π minus (-cos 0). Let&#39;s calculate that:-cos π is -(-1) which is 1, and -cos 0 is -1. So, subtracting these: 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, that&#39;s right? Because the integral of sin x dx is -cos x + C. So, definite integral from 0 to π:[-cos π] - [-cos 0] = [-(-1)] - [-1] = 1 - (-1) = 2. Yeah, that&#39;s correct. So the integral is 2. Then m is 3 times that, so m = 3*2 = 6. Okay, so m is 6. Got that.Now, the main part is to find the coefficient of the term ab²c^{m-3} in the expansion of (a + 2b - 3c)^m. Since m is 6, that term would be ab²c^{6-3} = ab²c³. So, we need the coefficient of ab²c³ in (a + 2b - 3c)^6.Alright, how do we approach this? The expression (a + 2b - 3c)^6 is a trinomial expansion. The general term in a trinomial expansion (x + y + z)^n is given by the multinomial theorem. The formula for the coefficient of a term x^k y^m z^p in (x + y + z)^n is n! / (k! m! p!) where k + m + p = n. But in our case, the variables are a, 2b, and -3c. So, we need to adjust for the coefficients of each term.Let me recall the multinomial theorem. For (a + b + c)^n, the coefficient of a term a^k1 b^k2 c^k3 is n! / (k1! k2! k3!) multiplied by the coefficients of each term raised to their respective powers. Wait, actually, if we have (x + y + z)^n where x, y, z can be expressions with coefficients, then each term in the expansion is (n! / (k1! k2! k3!)) * x^k1 * y^k2 * z^k3. So in our case, the terms are a, 2b, and -3c. So the coefficient for a term a^k1 (2b)^k2 (-3c)^k3 would be (6! / (k1! k2! k3!)) * 1^k1 * 2^k2 * (-3)^k3. But we want the term where the variables are ab²c³. That is, k1 = 1 (the exponent of a), k2 = 2 (the exponent of b), and k3 = 3 (the exponent of c). So let&#39;s check if those exponents add up to m, which is 6. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Yes, that works. So that term is present.So the coefficient would be (6! / (1! 2! 3!)) * (1)^1 * (2)^2 * (-3)^3. Let&#39;s compute that step by step.First, compute 6! divided by (1! 2! 3!). 6! is 720. 1! is 1, 2! is 2, 3! is 6. So the denominator is 1*2*6 = 12. Then 720 / 12 = 60. So that part is 60.Then multiply by (1)^1, which is 1. Then (2)^2 is 4. Then (-3)^3 is -27. So multiplying all these together: 60 * 1 * 4 * (-27). Let&#39;s compute 60 * 4 first, that&#39;s 240. Then 240 * (-27). Hmm, 240 * 27. Let&#39;s compute 24 * 27 first. 24*20=480, 24*7=168, so 480+168=648. Then 240*27=6480. So 6480 with the negative sign is -6480. So the coefficient is -6480.Wait, let me verify that again. Let&#39;s go step by step:Multinomial coefficient: 6! / (1! 2! 3!) = 720 / (1*2*6) = 720 / 12 = 60. Correct.Then, the coefficients from each term: a has coefficient 1, so 1^1=1. 2b has coefficient 2, so 2^2=4. -3c has coefficient -3, so (-3)^3=-27. Multiply all these together with the multinomial coefficient: 60 * 1 * 4 * (-27) = 60 * 4 * (-27) = 240 * (-27). Yes, 240*27=6480, so 240*(-27)=-6480. So the coefficient is -6480.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{-6480}.But let me check again to be thorough. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic.Wait, 1! 2! 3! = 1*2*6=12. 720 divided by 12 is indeed 60. Then 2^2 is 4, (-3)^3 is -27. So 60*4=240, 240*(-27)= -6480. Yes, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe the exponents are not correctly assigned. Let&#39;s confirm:In the term ab²c³, the exponents for a, b, c are 1, 2, 3 respectively. So in the expansion, each a comes with coefficient 1, each b term is 2b, so the coefficient for each b is 2, raised to power 2, and each c term is -3c, so coefficient -3 raised to power 3. So yes, that&#39;s 1^1 * 2^2 * (-3)^3. So that&#39;s correct.So combining with the multinomial coefficient, which is 60, gives us 60*1*4*(-27)=-6480.I think that&#39;s correct. Let me check if another approach gives the same answer. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or considering the expansion step by step, but that might be more complicated.Alternatively, think of the expansion as choosing 1 a, 2 b&#39;s, and 3 c&#39;s from the 6 factors. The number of ways to choose which factors contribute to a, b, or c is 6! / (1! 2! 3!) = 60, same as before. Then, each a is just 1, so 1^1. Each b is 2b, so 2^2. Each c is -3c, so (-3)^3. Then multiply all these together. So yes, same result.Therefore, I feel confident that the coefficient is indeed -6480.Final Answerboxed{-6480}&lt;/think&gt;First, we need to find the value of ( m ) by evaluating the integral:[m = 3 int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx]The integral of (sin x) from 0 to (pi) is:[int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx = -cos x Big|_{0}^{pi} = -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2]Thus, ( m = 3 times 2 = 6 ).Next, we need to find the coefficient of ( ab^2c^{m-3} ) (which simplifies to ( ab^2c^3 )) in the expansion of ( (a + 2b - 3c)^6 ). Using the multinomial theorem, the coefficient is given by:[frac{6!}{1! , 2! , 3!} times (1)^1 times (2)^2 times (-3)^3]Calculating the factorial term:[frac{6!}{1! , 2! , 3!} = frac{720}{1 times 2 times 6} = frac{720}{12} = 60]Calculating the product of the coefficients:[(1)^1 times (2)^2 times (-3)^3 = 1 times 4 times (-27) = -108]Multiplying these results together:[60 times (-108) = -6480]Thus, the coefficient of ( ab^2c^3 ) in the expansion is (boxed{-6480}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what is being asked. The problem says:&quot;Given that ( m = 3int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx ), find the coefficient of ( ab^{2}c^{m-3} ) in the expansion of the binomial ( (a + 2b - 3c)^{m} ).&quot;Okay, so first things first, I need to find the value of ( m ). Then, once I have ( m ), I need to determine the coefficient of the specific term ( ab^{2}c^{m-3} ) in the expansion of the trinomial ( (a + 2b - 3c)^m ). Wait, hold on, the problem says &quot;binomial,&quot; but ( (a + 2b - 3c) ) has three terms. Hmm, maybe that&#39;s a typo or maybe binomial is used more generally here. Anyway, regardless, it&#39;s a trinomial expansion. Let&#39;s proceed.Starting with calculating ( m ). The integral ( int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx ). The integral of ( sin x ) is ( -cos x ), so evaluating from 0 to ( pi ):( -cos pi - (-cos 0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2 ). So the integral from 0 to ( pi ) of ( sin x dx ) is 2. Then ( m = 3 * 2 = 6 ). So ( m = 6 ).So the problem simplifies to: Find the coefficient of ( ab^2c^{6 - 3} = ab^2c^{3} ) in the expansion of ( (a + 2b - 3c)^6 ).Now, the expression ( (a + 2b - 3c)^6 ). Since it&#39;s a trinomial, the expansion will involve terms of the form ( frac{6!}{k!l!m!} a^k (2b)^l (-3c)^m ) where ( k + l + m = 6 ). And we need the term where the exponents are ( a^1 b^2 c^3 ). So that corresponds to ( k = 1 ), ( l = 2 ), ( m = 3 ).Therefore, the coefficient would be ( frac{6!}{1!2!3!} times (2)^2 times (-3)^3 ).Let me compute that step by step.First, the multinomial coefficient: ( frac{6!}{1!2!3!} ). Calculating factorial 6 is 720. Then 1! is 1, 2! is 2, 3! is 6. So denominator is 1*2*6 = 12. So 720 / 12 = 60.Then, the coefficient from the terms: ( (2)^2 = 4 ), and ( (-3)^3 = -27 ). Multiply all together: 60 * 4 * (-27).First, 60 * 4 = 240. Then 240 * (-27). Let&#39;s compute that. 240 * 27 = 240*(20 + 7) = 240*20 + 240*7 = 4800 + 1680 = 6480. Then with the negative sign, it&#39;s -6480.Therefore, the coefficient of ( ab^2c^3 ) in the expansion is -6480.Wait, let me double-check each step to be sure.1. Calculating m:Integral of sin x from 0 to pi is indeed [ -cos x ] from 0 to pi, which is (-cos pi) - (-cos 0) = (-(-1)) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Then m = 3*2 = 6. Correct.2. Term needed: ab^2c^{6-3} = ab^2c^3. So exponents: 1, 2, 3. Sum to 1+2+3=6, which matches m=6. Good.3. Multinomial coefficient: 6! / (1!2!3!) = 720 / (1*2*6) = 720 / 12 = 60. Correct.4. Coefficients from each term:- For a^1, the coefficient is (1)^1 = 1, but since the term is a, which is multiplied by 1, it doesn&#39;t add any coefficient. Wait, actually, in the expression (a + 2b -3c)^6, each term&#39;s coefficient is as follows:The term a is just a, so when we take a from the brackets, we multiply by 1. The term 2b is selected for the b part, so each b term contributes a coefficient of 2. Similarly, the c term is -3c, so each c contributes a coefficient of -3.Therefore, in the expansion, each combination of k a&#39;s, l b&#39;s, and m c&#39;s (with k+l+m=6) will have coefficient: 1^k * 2^l * (-3)^m. Since k=1, l=2, m=3, the coefficients multiply to 1^1 * 2^2 * (-3)^3 = 1 * 4 * (-27) = -108. Then multiplied by the multinomial coefficient 60, giving 60*(-108) = -6480. That&#39;s correct.Wait, but in the previous calculation, I said 60*4*(-27). Which is the same as 60*(4*(-27)) = 60*(-108) = -6480. Yep.So all steps check out.Just to make sure, let&#39;s consider alternative approaches. For example, if someone tried to use the binomial theorem incorrectly here, but since it&#39;s a trinomial, the binomial theorem doesn&#39;t directly apply. The multinomial theorem is necessary. So the answer should be -6480.I think that&#39;s solid. Let me recap:m = 6, term is ab^2c^3. The coefficient is calculated using the multinomial coefficient multiplied by the coefficients raised to their respective exponents. The multinomial coefficient is 60, the product of the coefficients is 4*(-27) = -108. 60*(-108) = -6480. So the answer is -6480.Final AnswerThe coefficient is boxed{-6480}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( m = 3int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx ), we first calculate the integral:[int_{0}^{pi} sin x , dx = left[ -cos x right]_{0}^{pi} = -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2]Thus, ( m = 3 times 2 = 6 ).Next, we need to find the coefficient of ( ab^2c^{6-3} = ab^2c^3 ) in the expansion of ( (a + 2b - 3c)^6 ). Using the multinomial theorem, the coefficient is given by:[frac{6!}{1!2!3!} times (1)^1 times (2)^2 times (-3)^3]Calculating the multinomial coefficient:[frac{6!}{1!2!3!} = frac{720}{1 times 2 times 6} = frac{720}{12} = 60]Calculating the product of the coefficients:[(2)^2 times (-3)^3 = 4 times (-27) = -108]Multiplying these results together:[60 times (-108) = -6480]Thus, the coefficient of ( ab^2c^3 ) in the expansion is (boxed{-6480}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-8995579a></div><p class="review-content" data-v-8995579a><span class="icon" data-v-8995579a>🔑:</span>Analysis:This problem involves using calculus to solve a definite integral and finding the coefficient of a specific term in a binomial expansion, making it a moderately difficult problem.Step 1: Solve for mFirst, let&#39;s solve the given integral to find the value of m.begin{align*}m &amp;= 3int_{0}^{pi }{sin xdx} &amp;= -3cos xbig|_{0}^{pi} &amp;= -3(cos pi - cos 0) &amp;= -3(-1-1) &amp;= 6end{align*}Step 2: Find the CoefficientNow that we have m=6, we need to find the coefficient of ab^{2}c^{3} in the expansion of {{(a+2b-3c)}^{6}}. To do this, we&#39;ll use the multinomial theorem, which generalizes the binomial theorem to include powers of sums with more than two terms.In this case, we are looking for the coefficient of a^1b^2c^3, so we need to find the number of ways to choose 1 &#39;a&#39;, 2 &#39;b&#39;s, and 3 &#39;c&#39;s from the 6 terms in the expansion. This can be represented as a multinomial coefficient:C=frac{6!}{1!2!3!}=60Next, we need to account for the coefficients of &#39;b&#39; and &#39;c&#39; in the original binomial expression. The coefficient of &#39;b&#39; is 2, and the coefficient of &#39;c&#39; is -3. Since we have 2 &#39;b&#39;s and 3 &#39;c&#39;s, we need to raise these coefficients to the appropriate powers and multiply them together:D=(2^2)(-3^3)=4cdot(-27)=-108Finally, we multiply the multinomial coefficient C by D to find the coefficient of ab^{2}c^{3}:E=Ccdot D=60cdot(-108)=boxed{-6480}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-a16c1816><span data-v-a16c1816>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
