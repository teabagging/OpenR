The question is asking for the maximum value of k, which is the largest number of such subsets we can have under these conditions.Hmm, okay. Let&#39;s break this down. First, we have the set A with 10 elements. We need to create as many subsets as possible where each subset is non-empty, and any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. So, no two subsets can share three or more elements. The goal is to find the maximum number of subsets, k.This reminds me of combinatorial design problems, maybe something like a block design where you have certain intersection properties. In particular, it&#39;s similar to a pairwise balanced design where the intersection of any two blocks is limited. But I&#39;m not exactly sure about the exact terminology here. Maybe it&#39;s similar to a constant intersection size, but in this case, it&#39;s a maximum intersection size.Alternatively, maybe I can think of this in terms of graph theory. If each subset is a vertex in a graph, and we connect two vertices with an edge if their intersection has more than two elements. Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum independent set in this graph. But since the graph is defined such that edges represent forbidden pairs (those that intersect in more than two elements), the maximum independent set would be the largest collection of subsets where none are connected by an edge, i.e., no two subsets have an intersection larger than two. But maximum independent set is generally hard to compute, but maybe with the structure here, we can find bounds.Alternatively, maybe use the inclusion-exclusion principle or some combinatorial bounds like the Fisher&#39;s inequality, Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem, etc. Let me recall the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem, which gives the maximum number of k-element subsets of an n-element set such that every pair of subsets intersects in at least t elements. But in this case, our condition is the opposite: intersections are at most two elements. So maybe a different approach is needed.Another thought: For each subset, if we consider its size, maybe there&#39;s a relation between the size of the subsets and the number of subsets we can have. However, the problem doesn&#39;t restrict the size of the subsets; they just need to be non-empty. So subsets can be of any size from 1 to 10. But having larger subsets might lead to more overlaps with other subsets. So maybe smaller subsets are better for maximizing k?But wait, if we use only single-element subsets, then each subset is a singleton, and any two subsets would intersect in at most zero elements. So in that case, we could have as many subsets as there are elements in A, which is 10. But obviously, we can do better because even with pairs (two-element subsets), if we manage them such that no two pairs share more than two elements. But wait, two pairs can share at most one element. Wait, if two pairs share two elements, that means they are the same subset. Since pairs have two elements, the intersection of two distinct pairs can be at most one element. So actually, if we use all possible pairs, then any two distinct pairs intersect in at most one element, which satisfies the condition of intersecting in at most two elements. Therefore, if we take all 2-element subsets, which are C(10,2) = 45, then this family would satisfy the condition because any two subsets share at most one element. So in that case, k=45. But maybe we can do even better by combining subsets of different sizes?Wait, but if we include some larger subsets, say a 3-element subset, then that 3-element subset could potentially intersect with other subsets in up to three elements, but only if another subset also contains those three elements. So if we have a 3-element subset {a,b,c}, then any other subset that contains a, b, and c would intersect with it in three elements, which violates the condition. Therefore, to include a 3-element subset, we have to ensure that no other subset contains all three elements. But if we have only one subset that contains {a,b,c}, then maybe it&#39;s okay? But actually, if another subset contains two elements from {a,b,c}, that&#39;s allowed since the intersection is only two elements. So maybe as long as we don&#39;t have another subset that shares three elements with it. Wait, but even the 3-element subset itself, when paired with another 3-element subset, their intersection can be up to two elements. For example, {a,b,c} and {a,b,d} intersect in two elements, which is okay. So if we have 3-element subsets that pairwise intersect in at most two elements, then they can coexist. Therefore, maybe even using larger subsets can allow us to have more subsets without violating the intersection condition.But wait, the problem states that the family of subsets must have pairwise intersections of at most two elements. So, even if we have a mix of subset sizes, as long as any two subsets don&#39;t share more than two elements. Therefore, perhaps combining subsets of different sizes (singletons, pairs, triples, etc.) in a way that no two share more than two elements. The challenge is to maximize the total number of subsets.This seems like a problem where upper bounds can be calculated using combinatorial arguments. Let me think about how to model this.One approach is to use the inclusion matrix and linear algebra methods, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, consider the problem as a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a subset B_i, and the hypergraph is 2-intersecting, meaning that any two hyperedges share at most two vertices. Then, the question is to find the maximum number of hyperedges in such a hypergraph over 10 vertices. There might be known results about this.Alternatively, think about it from the perspective of projective planes or finite geometries, but I&#39;m not sure. Maybe think about pairwise intersections and use double counting or something.Let me try to use double counting. Let&#39;s denote the family of subsets as F = {B₁, B₂, ..., B_k}. Let&#39;s count the number of ordered triples (B, B&#39;, x) where B and B&#39; are distinct subsets in F, and x is an element in their intersection. Each such triple is counted once for each pair of subsets that contain x.For each element x in A, let&#39;s denote t_x as the number of subsets in F that contain x. Then, the number of ordered pairs (B, B&#39;) that contain x is t_x choose 2, which is t_x(t_x - 1)/2. Therefore, the total number of such triples is the sum over all x in A of t_x(t_x - 1)/2.On the other hand, since each pair of subsets B and B&#39; can intersect in at most two elements, the number of triples (B, B&#39;, x) is at most 2 * k(k - 1)/2 = k(k - 1). Because for each pair B, B&#39;, there are at most two elements x in their intersection, and there are k(k - 1)/2 pairs of subsets, each contributing at most two elements, so total triples is at most 2 * [k(k - 1)/2] = k(k - 1).Therefore, we have:Sum_{x ∈ A} [t_x(t_x - 1)/2] ≤ k(k - 1)Which can be rewritten as:Sum_{x ∈ A} t_x(t_x - 1) ≤ 2k(k - 1)This is an inequality that relates the number of subsets containing each element (t_x) to the total number of subsets k.Additionally, the sum over all x of t_x is equal to the total number of element occurrences across all subsets. Let&#39;s denote that as S = Sum_{x ∈ A} t_x. Since each subset is non-empty, S is at least k (if all subsets are singletons) and can be much larger if subsets are bigger.But we need another relation between S and k. Maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?We know that:Sum_{x ∈ A} t_x = SSum_{x ∈ A} t_x² ≥ (Sum t_x)² / n = S² / 10 by Cauchy-Schwarz.So, Sum t_x² ≥ S² / 10Then, the left-hand side of our earlier inequality is Sum t_x(t_x - 1) = Sum t_x² - Sum t_x = Sum t_x² - STherefore, Sum t_x² - S ≤ 2k(k - 1)But since Sum t_x² ≥ S² / 10, substituting that in:S² / 10 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1)Therefore,S² / 10 - S - 2k(k - 1) ≤ 0But S is related to the structure of the subsets. If all subsets are pairs, then S = 2k. If subsets are of different sizes, then S varies.Wait, but maybe we can bound S. For example, since each subset is non-empty, S ≥ k. Also, the maximum possible S is 10k (if every subset is the entire set A, but of course, those would have large intersections). However, in our case, since subsets can&#39;t intersect too much, perhaps S is not too large. But maybe this line of thought is not too helpful.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the case where all subsets are pairs (2-element subsets). Then, S = 2k, and the number of pairs is C(10,2) = 45. In that case, each t_x is equal to 9, since each element is in 9 pairs (since there are 9 other elements to pair with). Wait, no. For each element x, the number of pairs containing x is C(9,1) = 9. So t_x = 9 for each x. Therefore, Sum t_x = 10 * 9 = 90, which is 2k, so k=45. Then, Sum t_x(t_x -1) = 10 * 9*8 = 720. Then, 720 ≤ 2k(k -1) = 2*45*44 = 3960, which is true. But in this case, equality is not achieved. So the inequality is not tight here.But if we consider the case where we have a family of subsets where each element is contained in the same number of subsets, then maybe we can get a better bound.Alternatively, suppose that each element is contained in t subsets. Then, Sum t_x = 10t, so S=10t.Then, Sum t_x(t_x -1) = 10t(t -1)Therefore, 10t(t -1) ≤ 2k(k -1)But also, S = 10t = total number of elements in all subsets, so if all subsets are pairs, then S = 2k, so 10t = 2k =&gt; t = k/5.Then, substituting into the inequality:10*(k/5)*( (k/5) -1 ) ≤ 2k(k -1 )Simplify left side: 10*(k/5)*(k/5 -1) = 2k*(k/5 -1) = (2k²)/5 - 2kRight side: 2k(k -1) = 2k² - 2kSo the inequality becomes:(2k²)/5 - 2k ≤ 2k² - 2kSubtract left side from right side:2k² - 2k - (2k²/5 - 2k) = (10k²/5 - 2k²/5) -2k +2k = (8k²)/5 ≥ 0Which is always true. So this doesn&#39;t give us a useful upper bound.Alternatively, maybe we need to consider another approach.Suppose we model this problem as a graph where each subset is a vertex, and edges represent intersections of size &gt;2. Then, we need the maximum independent set in this graph. But this is too abstract, as the graph is not explicitly defined.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method? Not sure.Wait, let me check some known results. For a family of subsets where every pairwise intersection is at most t, the maximum size is related to the concept of a &quot;2-intersecting&quot; family. But usually, intersecting families refer to families where every pair intersects in at least one element. Here, it&#39;s the opposite; we need that every pair intersects in at most two elements.In extremal set theory, there is the concept of the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem which gives the maximum size of a family of k-element subsets where each pair intersects in at least t elements. But again, our problem is different.Wait, here&#39;s a theorem by Fisher, which is related to block designs. Fisher&#39;s inequality states that in a block design where each pair of blocks intersects in exactly λ blocks, the number of blocks is at least the number of elements. But again, this is for constant intersection size.Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to a hypergraph with bounded pairwise intersections. There is a theorem by Fisher, Bose, and others which might give bounds. Let me recall that the maximum number of subsets of an n-element set with each subset of size greater than t and pairwise intersections at most t is bounded. Wait, maybe that&#39;s the Fisher-type inequality.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the forbidden configurations. We are forbidden to have three elements that are all contained in two different subsets. Wait, no. If two subsets share three elements, that&#39;s forbidden, but subsets can share up to two elements. So, the forbidden configurations are pairs of subsets that share three or more elements.So, the question is similar to packing as many subsets as possible without having any two share three elements. So, this is a type of packing problem.In coding theory, this is analogous to code words with a certain minimum distance, but here it&#39;s about the intersection size.Alternatively, maybe use the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me think. The total number of subsets of A is 2^10 -1 =1023. But we need to exclude subsets that intersect with another subset in three or more elements. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, upper bound via considering that each subset &quot;forbids&quot; certain other subsets. For example, if I have a subset B, then any other subset that shares three or more elements with B is forbidden. But how many subsets share three or more elements with B? If B has size m, then the number of subsets that share at least three elements with B is Sum_{t=3 to m} C(m, t) * C(10 - m, s - t) for subsets of size s. But this varies depending on the size of B. This seems too variable.Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of a 2-design. Wait, a 2-(v, k, λ) design is a collection of k-element subsets (blocks) such that every pair of elements is contained in exactly λ blocks. But again, not directly applicable here.Wait, another idea: if we take all subsets of size ≤2, then any two subsets will intersect in at most two elements. Because if both subsets are singletons, their intersection is at most one element. If one is a singleton and the other is a pair, their intersection is at most one element. If both are pairs, their intersection is at most two elements (if they are the same pair, but since we are considering a family of distinct subsets, they can&#39;t be the same, so intersection is at most one element). Wait, actually, if we have two different pairs, they can intersect in at most one element. So if all subsets are of size ≤2, then any two distinct subsets intersect in at most one element, which satisfies the condition (since we need at most two). Therefore, the family of all subsets of size 1 and 2 would satisfy the condition. The number of such subsets is C(10,1) + C(10,2) = 10 + 45 = 55. So k=55 is possible.But the problem asks for the maximum k. Can we do better than 55? If we include some subsets of size ≥3, maybe we can have more subsets. For example, if we include a 3-element subset, how does that affect the total?Suppose we have a 3-element subset, say {a,b,c}. Now, any other subset that shares three elements with {a,b,c} is forbidden. But subsets that share two elements or fewer with {a,b,c} are allowed. So, how many subsets are forbidden because of {a,b,c}? Any subset that contains all three elements a,b,c is forbidden. But the original family already includes subsets of size ≤2, which cannot contain all three elements. So, if we include {a,b,c} in addition to all subsets of size ≤2, the only forbidden subsets would be those of size ≥3 that contain {a,b,c} as a subset. But since our family only includes {a,b,c} and subsets of size ≤2, there are no other subsets in the family that contain three elements. So actually, adding a 3-element subset to the family of all subsets of size ≤2 would still satisfy the condition, because the 3-element subset only intersects the smaller subsets in at most two elements. Wait, let&#39;s check:The 3-element subset {a,b,c} intersects with a singleton {a} in one element, which is okay. It intersects with a pair {a,b} in two elements, which is allowed. It doesn&#39;t intersect any other 3-element subset (since we only added one). Therefore, in this case, adding a 3-element subset to the family of all subsets of size ≤2 would still satisfy the pairwise intersection condition. Therefore, in this case, k becomes 55 +1=56.But then, can we add another 3-element subset? Let&#39;s say we add another 3-element subset {a,b,d}. Now, the intersection between {a,b,c} and {a,b,d} is two elements, which is allowed. So that&#39;s okay. Wait, but {a,b,c} and {a,b,d} share two elements, which is within the limit. Therefore, perhaps we can add multiple 3-element subsets as long as any two of them intersect in at most two elements. So, if we can add several 3-element subsets such that no two share three elements (which is impossible unless they are the same), and they share at most two elements, then adding them would be okay.But how many 3-element subsets can we add to the family of all 1- and 2-element subsets without violating the intersection condition? Each 3-element subset can be added as long as it doesn&#39;t conflict with existing subsets. But since the existing family includes all 1- and 2-element subsets, adding a 3-element subset only introduces intersections of size 1 or 2 with the existing subsets, which is acceptable. The problem comes when adding multiple 3-element subsets, since two 3-element subsets could intersect in two elements, which is allowed, or three elements, which is forbidden. But two different 3-element subsets can only intersect in at most two elements. So actually, as long as we don&#39;t have two identical 3-element subsets, any two distinct ones will intersect in at most two elements, which is acceptable. Therefore, in theory, we could add all 3-element subsets to the family, and the intersections between 3-element subsets would be at most two elements. Wait, but then the total family would consist of all subsets of size 1,2,3. But wait, let&#39;s check if that works.Take two 3-element subsets, say {a,b,c} and {a,b,d}. Their intersection is {a,b}, which is two elements, so that&#39;s okay. Similarly, any two distinct 3-element subsets intersect in at most two elements. Therefore, adding all 3-element subsets (C(10,3)=120) to the existing family of size 55 would result in 55+120=175 subsets. But wait, is this correct? Wait, no. Because the problem states that all subsets are non-empty, but there&#39;s no restriction on the size. However, when we add all 3-element subsets, we have to check that each 3-element subset doesn&#39;t intersect any other subset (including other 3-element subsets) in more than two elements. But as we just saw, two distinct 3-element subsets can only intersect in at most two elements, so that&#39;s okay. Similarly, a 3-element subset and a 1- or 2-element subset can intersect in at most two elements. Therefore, the entire family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 would satisfy the condition. But wait, hold on. The total number of subsets would then be C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3)=10+45+120=175. Is 175 the maximum?But wait, if we go further and add subsets of size 4. Let&#39;s see. A 4-element subset would intersect with another 4-element subset in up to 3 elements, which is forbidden. For example, {a,b,c,d} and {a,b,c,e} intersect in three elements. Therefore, we cannot have two 4-element subsets that share three elements. But even adding a single 4-element subset to the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 would be okay, as long as we don&#39;t add another 4-element subset that shares three elements with it. But adding one 4-element subset would intersect the existing 3-element subsets in three elements if the 3-element subset is a subset of the 4-element subset. For example, if we have a 4-element subset {a,b,c,d}, then the 3-element subset {a,b,c} is a subset of it, and their intersection is three elements, which is forbidden. Therefore, we cannot add any 4-element subsets to the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 because they would intersect the 3-element subsets in three elements. Therefore, the moment we add a 4-element subset, we have to remove all 3-element subsets that are subsets of it. But this complicates things.Therefore, if we want to include subsets of size 4, we need to ensure that they don&#39;t contain any 3-element subsets that are already present in the family. But if our family already includes all 3-element subsets, then adding a 4-element subset would require removing all C(4,3)=4 subsets of size 3 from the family. But since we want to maximize k, it&#39;s unclear whether this would be beneficial. Removing 4 subsets to add 1 might not be worth it. So maybe it&#39;s better not to include larger subsets.Similarly, subsets of size 5 or more would intersect with many smaller subsets in more than two elements. For example, a 5-element subset would contain C(5,3)=10 different 3-element subsets, each of which would intersect the 5-element subset in three elements. So, again, to include a 5-element subset, we would have to remove all those 10 3-element subsets, which might not be beneficial.Therefore, perhaps the optimal family is to take all subsets of size 1,2,3, which gives 175 subsets. But wait, earlier we thought that two 3-element subsets can intersect in two elements, which is allowed. But does that hold?Wait, let me verify. Take two different 3-element subsets: {a,b,c} and {a,b,d}. Their intersection is {a,b}, which has size two. That&#39;s allowed. If they intersect in three elements, they would be the same subset, which is not allowed since all subsets are distinct. Therefore, any two distinct 3-element subsets intersect in at most two elements, so they satisfy the condition. Therefore, including all 3-element subsets is okay.But then, why can&#39;t we include all subsets of size 1,2,3? The problem didn&#39;t restrict the subset sizes, only that they are non-empty and that any two distinct subsets intersect in at most two elements. So, if we include all subsets of size 1,2,3, then the intersections are:- Between a singleton and another singleton: 0 or 1 (but since they are distinct, 0)- Between a singleton and a pair: 0 or 1- Between a singleton and a 3-element subset: 0 or 1- Between two pairs: 0,1, or 2 elements (but since they are distinct pairs, maximum intersection is 1 element if they share one element, or 2 elements if they are the same pair, but since they are distinct, maximum 1)Wait, actually, two distinct pairs can share at most one element. Because if they share two elements, they would be the same pair. So, two distinct pairs intersect in at most one element. Similarly, a pair and a 3-element subset can intersect in 1 or 2 elements. For example, pair {a,b} and 3-element subset {a,b,c} intersect in two elements. That&#39;s allowed. Similarly, two 3-element subsets can intersect in two elements. So, in this case, the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 would satisfy the condition because all intersections are at most two elements. Therefore, the total number of subsets would be C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3) = 10+45+120=175. Therefore, k=175.But wait, the problem asks for the maximum value of k. Is 175 the correct answer? But let me check with an example. Suppose we have two 3-element subsets, {a,b,c} and {a,b,d}. Their intersection is {a,b}, which is two elements. That&#39;s okay. If we have a pair {a,b} and a 3-element subset {a,b,c}, their intersection is two elements, which is okay. If we have a pair {a,b} and another pair {a,c}, their intersection is one element, which is okay. So all intersections are within the limit. Therefore, all subsets of size up to 3 seem acceptable. So why not include all of them? Then, 175 subsets. But the problem states &quot;non-empty subsets&quot;, so subsets of size 1,2,...,10. But including subsets larger than 3 would cause intersections with existing subsets to exceed two elements.Wait, for example, if we include a 4-element subset {a,b,c,d}, then the pair {a,b} is a subset of it, and their intersection is {a,b}, which is two elements, so that&#39;s okay. Wait, but actually, the intersection between the 4-element subset and the pair {a,b} is two elements, which is allowed. Similarly, the intersection between the 4-element subset and a 3-element subset {a,b,c} is three elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, including a 4-element subset would conflict with existing 3-element subsets. Hence, to include a 4-element subset, we must not have any 3-element subsets that are subsets of it. But since our family includes all 3-element subsets, adding any 4-element subset would create intersections of size three with its 3-element subsets. Therefore, we cannot add any 4-element subsets to the family of all 1,2,3-element subsets.Therefore, if we stick to subsets of size at most 3, we can have 175 subsets. If we try to include larger subsets, we have to remove some existing subsets, which might not be beneficial. So maybe 175 is the maximum?But wait, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose we have A = {1,2,3}. What is the maximum k?If we take all subsets of size 1,2,3. The family would have 3 + 3 +1 =7 subsets. Now, check intersections:- Any two singletons: intersect at 0- Singleton and pair: intersect at 0 or 1- Singleton and 3-element: intersect at 1- Pair and pair: intersect at 0 or 1 (since in a 3-element set, two different pairs can share at most one element)- Pair and 3-element: intersect at 2 elements (the pair is a subset of the 3-element set)- 3-element and 3-element: only one 3-element subset, so no issue.But in this case, the pair {1,2} and the 3-element subset {1,2,3} intersect in two elements, which is allowed. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 satisfies the condition. However, in this case, is 7 the maximum? Let&#39;s see.If we try to include another subset, say a pair {1,2}, but it&#39;s already included. So no. Wait, already all subsets are included. So in this small case, it&#39;s possible. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, including all subsets of size up to 3 is acceptable, giving k=175. But this seems too large, and I suspect that maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, but in the original problem, when we have subsets of size 3, their intersections with other subsets of size 3 can be two elements, which is allowed. But when we have a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 3, their intersection is at most two elements. But when we have a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 4, but we don&#39;t have subsets of size 4. So in the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3, all intersections are indeed at most two elements.But according to this, the answer would be 175. But I have a feeling this is incorrect because when I look up similar problems, usually the maximum family size with pairwise intersections at most t is similar to the sum of subsets of size up to t+1, but I need to verify.Wait, let me consider another angle. In the problem, when you require that any two subsets intersect in at most two elements, the maximum family is all subsets with size at most three. Because any two subsets of size at most three can intersect in at most two elements. Wait, but a subset of size three and another subset of size three can intersect in two elements, which is allowed. A subset of size three and a subset of size two can intersect in two elements, which is allowed. A subset of size two and another subset of size two can intersect in one element. So yes, all subsets of size at most three would satisfy the condition. Therefore, the total number is C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3)=10+45+120=175.But is this the maximum? Or can we include some larger subsets as well without violating the intersection condition? For example, if we include a 4-element subset, but as we saw earlier, it would intersect with some 3-element subsets in three elements. For instance, the 4-element subset {a,b,c,d} would intersect with the 3-element subset {a,b,c} in three elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot include both. Therefore, to include a 4-element subset, we would have to exclude all 3-element subsets that are subsets of it. There are C(4,3)=4 such subsets. Therefore, adding one 4-element subset would require removing 4 subsets from the family. Whether this is a net gain depends on whether 1 added subset is worth removing 4. Since 1 -4= -3, it&#39;s a loss. Therefore, it&#39;s not beneficial. Similarly, adding a 5-element subset would require removing C(5,3)=10 subsets, which is even worse. Therefore, it&#39;s better not to include larger subsets.Therefore, the maximum family is indeed all subsets of size 1,2,3, totaling 175. But wait, this seems surprisingly large. Let me check a different resource or think of another way.Wait, but let&#39;s test with a smaller set. Let&#39;s take A={1,2,3}. If we include all subsets of size 1,2,3, that&#39;s 7 subsets. Now, according to the condition, any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. Let&#39;s check all pairs:- Singleton and singleton: intersect in 0- Singleton and pair: intersect in 0 or 1- Singleton and triple: intersect in 1- Pair and pair: intersect in 0 or 1- Pair and triple: intersect in 1 or 2 (since the pair is a subset of the triple)- Triple and triple: only one triple, so no intersectionAll intersections are at most 2, which satisfies the condition. So in this case, including all subsets of size up to 3 works, giving k=7. If we tried to include a 4-element subset, but A only has 3 elements, so that&#39;s not possible. So in this case, it&#39;s correct.Similarly, for A={1,2,3,4}, the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 would have C(4,1)+C(4,2)+C(4,3)=4+6+4=14 subsets. Checking intersections:- Any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. For example, two different 3-element subsets intersect in two elements (since in a 4-element set, two triples share exactly two elements). A 3-element subset and a pair can intersect in two elements. A pair and another pair can intersect in 0 or 1 elements. So this works.Thus, the pattern seems that for a set of size n, the family of all subsets of size at most 3 would satisfy the condition that any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. Therefore, the maximum k would be C(n,1)+C(n,2)+C(n,3).But wait, in our original problem, n=10. So, k=10+45+120=175. But I need to confirm if this is indeed the maximum or if there&#39;s a way to have a larger family by including some larger subsets along with some smaller ones, carefully avoiding intersections over two elements.Wait, suppose we take all subsets of size at most 3, which is 175, and then try to add a 4-element subset that doesn&#39;t contain any 3-element subsets. But in a 10-element set, a 4-element subset contains C(4,3)=4 different 3-element subsets. Since our family already includes all 3-element subsets, adding this 4-element subset would mean that it intersects those 4 existing 3-element subsets in three elements each, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot add any 4-element subset without violating the intersection condition.Alternatively, could we remove those 4 subsets and add the 4-element subset? Then, we would have a net change of 1 -4 = -3, which is worse. So not beneficial.Similarly, adding a 5-element subset would require removing C(5,3)=10 subsets, which is even worse. Therefore, it&#39;s better to keep all subsets of size at most 3.Another approach: suppose that instead of taking all subsets of size at most 3, we take all subsets of size exactly 3. Then, the intersections between any two subsets are at most two elements. But the number of subsets would be C(10,3)=120. But if we combine them with all subsets of size 1 and 2, which are 10+45=55, as before, making a total of 175.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different family structure that allows more subsets. For example, if we use a Steiner system. A Steiner system S(t,k,v) is a set of v elements with subsets of size k (called blocks) such that every t-element subset is contained in exactly one block. But in our case, we want that every two blocks intersect in at most two elements. I don&#39;t know if Steiner systems would help here.Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of a hypergraph with maximum degree 2 on the edges. But not sure.Wait, let&#39;s think about the total number of pairs. Each subset of size m contains C(m,2) pairs. If we have k subsets, then the total number of pairs covered is Sum_{i=1 to k} C(|B_i|, 2). However, in our problem, the intersection condition implies that no pair is contained in more than one subset. Wait, is that true?Wait, if two subsets share three elements, then they share C(3,2)=3 pairs. But the problem states that two subsets can share at most two elements. Therefore, two subsets cannot share three elements, so they cannot share three pairs. However, they can share two elements, which is one pair, or one element, which is zero pairs. Therefore, the intersection of two subsets can contain at most one pair. Wait, no: If two subsets intersect in two elements, that is a pair. So, if two subsets share two elements, they share one pair. Therefore, in terms of pairs, the condition is that any pair of elements is contained in at most one subset. Wait, no. Because a pair can be contained in multiple subsets, as long as no two subsets share three elements. Wait, actually, if two subsets share two elements (i.e., a pair), that is allowed. But if two subsets share three elements, which would mean they share three pairs, that&#39;s forbidden. So, the condition is not on the pairs, but on the subsets. So, two subsets can share a pair (i.e., two elements), but cannot share three elements.Therefore, multiple subsets can contain the same pair, as long as no two subsets share three elements. Therefore, the pair can be in multiple subsets. Therefore, the earlier idea about pairs being unique is not necessary.So, this is different from a block design where each pair is contained in at most one block. Here, multiple blocks can contain the same pair, as long as they don&#39;t share a third element. For example, two different subsets can both contain the pair {a,b}, as long as they don&#39;t share a third element. So, subset,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum value of k. The set A is {0,1,2,...,9}, and there&#39;s a family of non-empty subsets B₁, B₂, ..., B_k. The condition is that when i ≠ j, the intersection of B_i and B_j has at most two elements. I need to figure out the largest possible k. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding what exactly is being asked here.First, A is a set with 10 elements. The family of subsets {B₁, B₂, ..., B_k} are all non-empty, so each B_i has at least one element. The key condition is that any two different subsets can share at most two elements. So, if I have two subsets B and C in this family, their intersection can&#39;t have three or more elements; it can only have 0, 1, or 2 elements. My goal is to maximize the number of subsets k in this family while satisfying that condition.This reminds me of a combinatorial problem where you have constraints on intersections of sets. Maybe something related to block design or something similar? Let me recall. In combinatorics, there&#39;s the concept of a pairwise intersecting family where intersections are limited. Specifically, if each pair of sets intersects in at most t elements, then we can bound the maximum size of such a family. This might be related to the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem, but I think that&#39;s more about intersecting families where every pair intersects in at least t elements. Maybe this is the opposite?Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of codewords with a certain Hamming distance, but that&#39;s in coding theory. Hmm. Wait, in set theory terms, limiting the intersection size is like saying the sets are &quot;not too similar&quot;. So, if we want as many subsets as possible without having too much overlap, that&#39;s a standard problem.Let me think about the possible approaches. One approach could be to look at all subsets of A of a certain size and see how they intersect. However, since the problem allows subsets of any size (as long as they are non-empty), we might need a different strategy. But maybe the maximum k is achieved when all subsets have the same size? That&#39;s often the case in such problems because having uniform size can maximize or minimize certain intersection properties.Let me check. Suppose all subsets are pairs (size 2). Then, two different pairs can intersect in at most one element, which is within the condition (since the maximum allowed is two). But if I take all possible pairs, how many are there? For 10 elements, there are C(10,2) = 45 pairs. But if we take all pairs, then any two subsets (pairs) intersect in at most one element. So, this family would satisfy the condition, but maybe we can do better by using larger subsets?Wait, but if we use larger subsets, say triples (size 3), then two triples can intersect in two elements. For example, {1,2,3} and {1,2,4} intersect in two elements. That&#39;s still allowed. But if we have too many triples, maybe the number of subsets is higher? Let me calculate. How many triples can we have such that any two intersect in at most two elements? That&#39;s actually all triples, because any two distinct triples can share at most two elements. So, all triples would satisfy the condition. The number of triples is C(10,3) = 120. That&#39;s way more than the 45 pairs. So, clearly, using larger subsets can give us a larger family. But wait, but the problem allows subsets of any size. So perhaps mixing different sizes?Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t restrict the size of the subsets, only that they are non-empty. So, the family could include subsets of size 1, 2, ..., up to 10. However, if we include subsets of size 1 (singletons), then each singleton can only be in the family once. Because if you have two singletons, say {1} and {1}, they are the same subset, but since they have to be different subsets, their intersection is {1}, which is allowed (size 1). Wait, but actually, no—the problem states that the family is a set of subsets, so they have to be distinct. But if we have two different singletons, say {1} and {2}, their intersection is empty, which is allowed. But if we have two different subsets, one singleton {1} and another subset that contains 1 and other elements, then their intersection is {1}, which is allowed. So, actually, including all singletons is okay. Similarly, all pairs, all triples, etc., but with the caveat that when you have subsets of different sizes, their intersections could be larger? Wait, no. For example, a subset of size 4 and another subset of size 5 could intersect in 3 elements, which would violate the condition. So, if I include all subsets, then certainly some pairs would have intersections larger than two. Therefore, I can&#39;t just take all subsets. So, the problem is to select as many subsets as possible such that no two subsets share more than two elements.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible family of subsets of A where any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. So, this is a classic problem in extremal set theory. Let me recall if there&#39;s a theorem about this.Yes, there is the concept of the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, but that usually deals with intersecting families where every pair has at least a certain intersection. However, here we have the opposite: every pair has at most a certain intersection. So, maybe it&#39;s a different theorem.Wait, the problem is similar to the concept of a &quot;2-intersecting family&quot;, but actually, here it&#39;s the opposite. The family is required to have at most 2 elements in common between any two sets. So, the maximum size of such a family. In general, for a family of subsets where every pairwise intersection has size at most t, the maximum possible family is the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n, s) for s from 0 to t+1. Wait, no, that doesn&#39;t sound right. Wait, actually, if you take all subsets of size at most t+1, then any two subsets will intersect in at most t elements. Let me check. If all subsets are of size ≤ t+1, then two subsets can intersect in at most t elements, right? Because if both subsets have size t+1, the maximum intersection is t+1, but if t is the limit, so maybe that&#39;s not the case.Wait, let&#39;s take t=2. If we take all subsets of size at most 3, then two subsets of size 3 can intersect in up to 3 elements, which would violate the condition. Therefore, that approach doesn&#39;t work. So, perhaps taking all subsets of size at most 2? Then, any two subsets can intersect in at most 2 elements. But wait, a subset of size 1 and another subset of size 2 can intersect in 1 element, which is allowed. A subset of size 2 and another subset of size 2 can intersect in at most 2 elements (if they are the same subset, but they are distinct, so maximum intersection is 1 element). Wait, no, two different subsets of size 2 can share at most 1 element. Wait, if two subsets of size 2 are different, then their intersection is either 0 or 1 elements, right? Because if they share both elements, then they are the same subset. So, actually, if all subsets are of size ≤ 2, then any two distinct subsets intersect in at most 1 element, which is within the allowed two elements. Wait, but the problem allows intersections of up to two elements. So, in that case, subsets of size 3 might be allowed as long as no two subsets share three elements.Wait, perhaps we can include some subsets of size 3 as long as they don&#39;t intersect with other subsets in three elements. But if we include even one subset of size 3, then another subset of size 3 could intersect with it in three elements, which would be bad. But if we have only one subset of size 3, then it&#39;s okay, but adding more could create intersections. Hmm. So, maybe the maximum family is all subsets of size at most 2, which would give C(10,1) + C(10,2) = 10 + 45 = 55 subsets, but maybe we can do better by including some subsets of size 3.Wait, but how? If we include a subset of size 3, say {1,2,3}, then we can&#39;t include any other subset that contains all three of 1,2,3. But if we include another subset of size 3 that shares two elements with it, like {1,2,4}, that&#39;s okay. Their intersection is two elements. So, maybe we can have multiple subsets of size 3 as long as they don&#39;t share three elements with each other. But how many can we have?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a way to structure the family so that all subsets are of size 3, but arranged such that any two share at most two elements. But since any two distinct subsets of size 3 automatically share at most two elements, that&#39;s already the case. So, in fact, all subsets of size 3 would satisfy the condition. Then, the number of subsets would be C(10,3) = 120. But wait, if I take all subsets of size 3, then two subsets can intersect in two elements, which is allowed, but if we also include subsets of other sizes, like size 4, then a subset of size 4 and a subset of size 3 could intersect in three elements. For example, if there&#39;s a subset {1,2,3,4} and another subset {1,2,3,5}, their intersection is {1,2,3}, which is three elements. That would violate the condition. So, if we include subsets of size 3 and 4, we have to be careful. Therefore, to maximize k, maybe it&#39;s better to stick to subsets of a certain size where intersections are controlled.So, if we take all subsets of size 3, that&#39;s 120 subsets, each pair intersecting in at most two elements. That seems good. If we take all subsets of size 4, similarly, two subsets can intersect in at most three elements, which would violate the condition. So, we can&#39;t take all subsets of size 4. Therefore, subsets of size 3 might be the sweet spot here. Wait, but even subsets of size 3 can be part of a larger family. Wait, but if we take all subsets of size 3, that&#39;s 120, which is already more than the 55 subsets of size ≤2. But perhaps even better?Wait, but if we take all subsets of size 3 and all subsets of size 2 and 1, we might have intersections between the subsets of size 3 and subsets of size 2. For example, a subset of size 3 {1,2,3} and a subset of size 2 {1,2} intersect in two elements, which is allowed. Similarly, a subset of size 3 and a singleton {1} intersect in one element, which is okay. So, actually, maybe we can include all subsets of size 1, 2, and 3. Let&#39;s check. The total number would be C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 10 + 45 + 120 = 175. But is this allowed? Let me verify with an example. Suppose we have two subsets: one of size 3, {1,2,3}, and another of size 3, {1,2,4}; their intersection is {1,2}, which is allowed. A subset of size 3 and a subset of size 2, say {1,2} and {1,2,3}, intersect in two elements. That&#39;s okay. A subset of size 3 and a singleton {1} intersect in one element. So, all of these are within the allowed two-element intersection. However, if we have a subset of size 4, say {1,2,3,4}, and a subset of size 3, {1,2,3}, their intersection is three elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, if we include subsets of size 4, they can&#39;t be included with subsets of size 3. So, maybe the maximum family is all subsets of size 1, 2, and 3. But wait, that gives 175 subsets, but is there a way to include some subsets of larger sizes without violating the intersection condition?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way to include some larger subsets without conflicting with others. For example, if we have a subset of size 4, but ensure that no other subset shares three elements with it. But how? If we have a subset of size 4, say {1,2,3,4}, then any other subset that includes any three elements from this set would intersect in three elements. So, to include this subset, we would have to exclude all subsets that contain any three elements from {1,2,3,4}. But that would require removing a lot of subsets, which might not be worth it. Therefore, perhaps including larger subsets is counterproductive because they restrict the number of smaller subsets we can include, leading to a net loss in the total number of subsets.So, maybe the maximum k is indeed the total number of subsets of size 1, 2, and 3. That would be 10 + 45 + 120 = 175. But wait, let me check again. If all subsets of size 1, 2, and 3 are included, then any two subsets from this family will intersect in at most two elements. For example, two subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most two elements. A subset of size 3 and a subset of size 2 can intersect in at most two elements. Two subsets of size 2 can intersect in at most one element. Subsets of size 1 can only intersect in zero elements with other subsets of size 1. So, yes, all intersections are within the limit. Therefore, 175 subsets. But is this the maximum possible?Wait, but the problem states &quot;non-empty subsets&quot;, so subsets of size 1 to 10. But if we include all subsets of size 1,2,3, then we have 175. But perhaps there&#39;s a way to include some subsets of size 4 or higher without violating the intersection condition, thereby increasing k beyond 175. Let&#39;s consider.Suppose we add a subset of size 4, say S = {1,2,3,4}. Now, we have to make sure that no other subset in the family shares three elements with S. That means we need to remove all subsets of size 3 that are contained in S. There are C(4,3) = 4 subsets of size 3 within S. If we remove these 4 subsets from our family, we can add the subset S. So, the net change would be -4 +1 = -3. So, we actually lose 3 subsets. That&#39;s not beneficial. Similarly, if we add a subset of size 5, we would have to remove all subsets of size 3, 4 within it. But since subsets of size 4 are not in the family yet, we only need to remove subsets of size 3. For a subset of size 5, there are C(5,3) = 10 subsets of size 3. So, removing 10 subsets to add 1 subset of size 5 is a net loss of 9. Even worse.Alternatively, maybe if we add multiple larger subsets in a way that they don&#39;t interfere with each other. For example, if we can find several subsets of size 4 such that none of them share three elements with each other or with any other subsets. But designing such a system might be complicated. Let me think.Suppose we have a subset of size 4, S1 = {1,2,3,4}, and another subset of size 4, S2 = {5,6,7,8}. These two subsets are disjoint, so their intersection is empty. But if we include S1, we have to remove all subsets of size 3 within S1. Similarly for S2. So, removing 4 + 4 = 8 subsets of size 3, and adding 2 subsets of size 4. Net change: -8 +2 = -6. Still a loss.Alternatively, if we can find overlapping subsets of size 4 that share exactly two elements. For example, S1 = {1,2,3,4} and S2 = {3,4,5,6}. Their intersection is {3,4}, which is allowed. However, to include S1, we need to remove all subsets of size 3 within S1 (4 subsets). To include S2, we need to remove all subsets of size 3 within S2 (another 4 subsets). However, the subsets of size 3 in S1 and S2 might overlap. For example, the subset {3,4,5} is in S2 but not in S1. Wait, no, S1 is {1,2,3,4}, so its subsets of size 3 are {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}. S2&#39;s subsets of size 3 are {3,4,5}, {3,4,6}, {3,5,6}, {4,5,6}. So, they don&#39;t overlap. So, removing 4 + 4 = 8 subsets of size 3, and adding 2 subsets of size 4. Still a net loss of 6. So, not beneficial.Alternatively, maybe if the larger subsets share some subsets of size 3, thereby overlapping in the subsets that need to be removed. For example, S1 = {1,2,3,4} and S2 = {1,2,5,6}. Their intersection is {1,2}, so allowed. The subsets of size 3 in S1 are as before, and in S2 they are {1,2,5}, {1,2,6}, {1,5,6}, {2,5,6}. These don&#39;t overlap with S1&#39;s subsets. So again, removing 8 subsets of size 3 and adding 2 subsets of size 4. Net loss of 6.It seems that adding any subset of size 4 or higher requires removing more subsets of size 3 than the number gained, leading to a decrease in k. Therefore, maybe the maximum k is indeed 175, the total number of subsets of size 1, 2, and 3. But wait, let&#39;s verify with the problem statement again.Wait, the problem says &quot;non-empty subsets of A&quot;, so subsets of any size from 1 to 10. But if we take all subsets of size 1,2,3, that&#39;s 175. But is there a way to include some subsets of size 4 or higher without removing too many subsets of size 3? For example, if we include a subset of size 4 but don&#39;t remove any subsets of size 3, then we might have intersections of three elements between the subset of size 4 and some subsets of size 3. For example, the subset {1,2,3,4} and the subset {1,2,3} would intersect in three elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot just include a subset of size 4 without removing the conflicting subsets of size 3. So, the conclusion is that adding larger subsets necessitates the removal of more subsets than gained, leading to a lower total k. Therefore, the maximum k is 175.Wait, but hold on. Let me check some references or similar problems. In extremal set theory, the problem of maximizing the number of subsets with pairwise intersections at most t is a well-known problem. The maximum number is given by the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n,t+1). Wait, but in our case, t=2. Then the maximum family should be C(10,0) + C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 1 + 10 + 45 + 120 = 176. But wait, we have to exclude the empty set, because the problem states &quot;non-empty subsets&quot;. Therefore, 176 -1 = 175. So yes, that matches. So, according to this theorem, the maximum family is all subsets of size at most 3, which gives 175 subsets. Therefore, the answer should be 175. But let me confirm this theorem.Wait, actually, the theorem is called the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for intersecting families, but when we are dealing with families where intersections are bounded above, the result is sometimes called the anti-chain or the Sperner&#39;s theorem, but Sperner&#39;s theorem is about families where no subset contains another. Hmm. Wait, no. Maybe it&#39;s the inclusion of all subsets of size ≤ t+1. Wait, no, in the case where the intersection is at most t, the family of all subsets of size ≤ t+1 is not necessarily the maximum. For example, in our case, with t=2, the family of all subsets of size ≤3. However, if two subsets of size 3 intersect in 3 elements, which would be the same subset, but since they are distinct, the intersection is at most 2. Wait, actually, two distinct subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most 2 elements, right? Because if they share 3 elements, they&#39;d be the same subset. So, actually, all subsets of size ≤3 automatically satisfy the condition that any two distinct subsets intersect in at most 2 elements. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size 1,2,3 is a valid family with the required property, and its size is C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 10 + 45 + 120 = 175. Therefore, according to this logic, 175 is the maximum k.But then why does the theorem say &quot;the sum up to t+1&quot;, which in this case would be 3, so indeed, subsets of size up to 3. But let me check for a smaller case. For example, suppose A has 3 elements. Then, the family of all subsets of size ≤2. The number is C(3,1) + C(3,2) = 3 + 3 = 6. However, in this case, all subsets except the one of size 3. If we include the size 3 subset, then it would intersect with each of the size 2 subsets in 2 elements, which is allowed. Wait, but two subsets: the size 3 subset and a size 2 subset, their intersection is 2 elements, which is allowed. So, actually, in this case, including the size 3 subset as well would give 7 subsets, which is all subsets except the empty set. But the problem states &quot;non-empty subsets&quot;, so in this case, the maximum k would be 7. But according to the formula, for t=2, and n=3, the sum would be C(3,0)+C(3,1)+C(3,2)+C(3,3) = 1+3+3+1=8, minus 1 for non-empty, 7. Which matches. So, in this case, including all subsets is allowed because the maximum intersection is 2 elements (since the entire set is size 3, and a subset of size 2 and 3 intersect in 2 elements). So, in that case, the family of all non-empty subsets works. Wait, but in the original problem with n=10, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 would include subsets of size 3, which can intersect with other subsets of size 3 in up to 2 elements. But also, if we include a subset of size 4, it can intersect with a subset of size 3 in 3 elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, in the original problem, we cannot include subsets larger than 3. Therefore, the maximum family is all subsets of size 1,2,3, which gives 175. Therefore, the answer is 175.But wait, let me confirm with another example. Suppose n=4, and t=2. Then, according to the formula, the maximum family should be all subsets of size ≤3. The number is C(4,1)+C(4,2)+C(4,3)=4+6+4=14. The total non-empty subsets are 15, so only excluding the subset of size 4. But if we include the subset of size 4, then it would intersect with subsets of size 3 in 3 elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, we can&#39;t include it. So, the maximum family is 14. Which is correct. Therefore, the formula holds.Thus, returning to the original problem with n=10 and t=2, the maximum family is all subsets of size ≤3, giving 10 + 45 + 120 = 175. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{175}.Wait, but I just thought of something. In the problem statement, it says &quot;non-empty subsets&quot;, so when n=10, all subsets of size 1,2,3. But what if there exists a larger family that includes some subsets of size greater than 3, but arranged in such a way that they don&#39;t violate the intersection condition? For example, maybe projective planes or combinatorial designs allow for larger families with controlled intersections. But in projective planes, you have that each pair of lines intersects in exactly one point, but that&#39;s more structured.Alternatively, maybe a code with certain properties. But perhaps in this case, the upper bound given by the inclusion of all subsets of size at most 3 is actually the maximum. Let me check the upper bound.In extremal set theory, there&#39;s a theorem called the Fisher&#39;s inequality or the inclusion-exclusion bounds, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the theorem by de Bruijn and Tengbergen might be relevant here. Let me recall. The de Bruijn-Tengbergen theorem states that for a family of subsets of an n-element set with pairwise intersections of size at most t, the maximum size is the sum of the largest k binomial coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the de Bruijn-Tengbergen theorem is about the maximum size of a family of subsets with all subsets of the same size, and pairwise intersections at most t. Wait, maybe not. Let me look it up mentally.Wait, actually, the theorem states that for families of subsets of size k, the maximum size with pairwise intersections at most t is C(n-1, k-1). But that&#39;s the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for intersecting families. Wait, maybe not. Let me focus.Alternatively, the maximum number of subsets of a set of size n with pairwise intersections at most t is indeed the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n,t+1). This is known as the Sauer-Shelah lemma, but I think that&#39;s about shattering sets. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the answer is that if you take all subsets of size at most t+1, then any two subsets will intersect in at most t elements, which is the condition here. Therefore, this family has size C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n, t+1). However, if we exclude the empty set (since the problem requires non-empty subsets), then the size is C(n,1) + ... + C(n, t+1). For our case, t=2, so sum from 1 to 3: C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3) = 10+45+120=175. Therefore, this is the maximum possible family.But is there a way to have a larger family? Suppose that we can take more subsets by mixing subsets of different sizes, but carefully. For example, if we take some subsets of size 4 along with some subsets of size 3, making sure that the subsets of size 4 don&#39;t intersect the subsets of size 3 in more than two elements. But how? If a subset of size 4 and a subset of size 3 share three elements, their intersection is three, which is invalid. Therefore, to include a subset of size 4, you have to make sure that no subset of size 3 in the family shares three elements with it. Which would require that all subsets of size 3 that are subsets of the size 4 subset are excluded. But in the current family of all subsets of size 1,2,3, all subsets of size 3 are present. Therefore, adding a subset of size 4 would require removing C(4,3)=4 subsets of size 3. So, the trade-off is removing 4 subsets to add 1, which is a net loss of 3. Therefore, not beneficial. Similarly, adding a subset of size 5 would require removing C(5,3)=10 subsets of size 3, resulting in a net loss of 9. So, it&#39;s not beneficial.Therefore, the conclusion is that the maximum family is indeed all non-empty subsets of size at most 3, totaling 175 subsets. Hence, the maximum k is 175.Final Answerboxed{175}&lt;/think&gt;Given the set ( A = {0, 1, 2, ldots, 9} ) and a family of non-empty subsets ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k} ) such that the intersection of any two distinct subsets ( B_i ) and ( B_j ) has at most two elements, we need to find the maximum value of ( k ).To solve this, we consider the properties of subsets and their intersections. The key condition is that any two distinct subsets can intersect in at most two elements. We start by noting that subsets of size 1, 2, or 3 inherently satisfy this condition because:- Two distinct subsets of size 1 intersect in at most 0 elements.- Two distinct subsets of size 2 intersect in at most 1 element.- Two distinct subsets of size 3 intersect in at most 2 elements.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 2 intersect in at most 1 element.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 3 intersect in at most 1 element.- A subset of size 2 and a subset of size 3 intersect in at most 2 elements.Including subsets of size 4 or larger would risk intersections of more than two elements with other subsets, which violates the given condition. Therefore, we focus on subsets of size 1, 2, and 3.The number of such subsets is calculated as follows:- Subsets of size 1: ( binom{10}{1} = 10 )- Subsets of size 2: ( binom{10}{2} = 45 )- Subsets of size 3: ( binom{10}{3} = 120 )Summing these, we get the total number of non-empty subsets that satisfy the condition:[binom{10}{1} + binom{10}{2} + binom{10}{3} = 10 + 45 + 120 = 175]Thus, the maximum value of ( k ) is (boxed{175}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum number k of non-empty subsets B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ of set A = {0,1,2,...,9} such that any two different subsets intersect in at most two elements. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to think through this step by step.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a set A with 10 elements, and we need a family of subsets where each subset is non-empty, and any two subsets share at most two common elements. We need to find the largest possible number of subsets in such a family.This seems related to combinatorial design theory, maybe something like block designs where you have certain intersection properties. But I&#39;m not too familiar with specific design theories, so maybe I need to approach this from first principles.Let me consider how subsets can intersect. Since each pair of subsets can share at most two elements, we need to arrange the subsets in such a way that their overlaps are controlled. If we can maximize the number of subsets while keeping their intersections small, that would give the maximum k.First, let&#39;s think about the simplest case: all subsets are pairwise disjoint. In that case, the maximum number of subsets would be equal to the number of elements in A, which is 10. But obviously, allowing some intersections can let us have more subsets. But here, the restriction is that intersections can be at most two elements. So maybe we can have more subsets by allowing controlled overlaps.Alternatively, if we use all possible subsets of A, that would be 2¹⁰ - 1 = 1023 non-empty subsets, but clearly, many of them intersect in more than two elements. So we need to restrict ourselves to a family where any two subsets meet the intersection condition.I remember that in combinatorics, there&#39;s something called the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem which deals with intersecting families of sets. Maybe that can be useful here. The classic Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem gives the maximum number of k-element subsets of an n-element set such that every pair of subsets has a non-empty intersection. But in our problem, the intersection is limited to at most two elements, which is a different condition.Wait, maybe it&#39;s the other way around. We don&#39;t want the intersections to be too large. So perhaps we can use the concept of a family of sets with bounded pairwise intersections. I think there is a theorem or a result related to that.Yes, Fisher&#39;s inequality or maybe something from hypergraph theory. Let me recall. If we model each subset as a hyperedge in a hypergraph, then our problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of hyperedges in a 10-vertex hypergraph where every two hyperedges intersect in at most two vertices. So, hypergraphs with bounded pairwise intersections.I believe that for such hypergraphs, upper bounds can be derived using combinatorial arguments, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle or double counting.Let me try a double counting approach. Let&#39;s denote the family of subsets as B = {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ}. Let’s consider the number of ordered pairs (B_i, B_j) where i &lt; j and B_i ∩ B_j is non-empty. Since each pair can intersect in at most two elements, the total number of such intersecting pairs is at most C(k, 2) * 2, but that might not be directly helpful.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the number of incidences between elements of A and the subsets. Each element is contained in some number of subsets. Let&#39;s denote r_i as the number of subsets containing element i. Then, the total number of incidences is Σ_{i=0}^9 r_i. But how does this relate to the intersections?Each pair of subsets that contain element i contributes to the intersection at i. So, for each element i, the number of pairs of subsets that contain i is C(r_i, 2). Since any two subsets can intersect in at most two elements, the total number of pairs of subsets that share any element is bounded by C(10, 1) * C(r_i, 2), but actually, more accurately, the total number of intersecting pairs across all elements is Σ_{i=0}^9 C(r_i, 2). However, since each pair of subsets can intersect in at most two elements, the total number of such intersections is at most 2 * C(k, 2). Therefore, we have the inequality:Σ_{i=0}^9 C(r_i, 2) ≤ 2 * C(k, 2)This seems like a key inequality. Let me write that again:Σ_{i=0}^9 [r_i choose 2] ≤ 2 * [k choose 2]Because each element i is in r_i subsets, so the number of pairs of subsets that contain i is C(r_i, 2). The total over all elements is the sum on the left. On the other hand, each pair of subsets can intersect in at most two elements, so the total number of intersecting pairs across all elements is at most 2 * C(k, 2), since each pair can contribute at most two intersections.So this inequality is crucial. Let me compute both sides.First, the left-hand side (LHS):Σ_{i=0}^9 [r_i(r_i - 1)/2] = (1/2) Σ_{i=0}^9 r_i² - (1/2) Σ_{i=0}^9 r_iThe right-hand side (RHS):2 * [k(k - 1)/2] = k(k - 1)Therefore, combining these:(1/2) Σ r_i² - (1/2) Σ r_i ≤ k(k - 1)Multiply both sides by 2:Σ r_i² - Σ r_i ≤ 2k(k - 1)But also, note that Σ r_i is equal to the total number of elements in all subsets. Let&#39;s denote this as S. Since each subset is non-empty, the total number S is at least k (if each subset has at least one element). However, we don&#39;t know the exact sizes of the subsets, so this could vary.But we can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate Σ r_i² and (Σ r_i)². Specifically, we know that Σ r_i² ≥ (Σ r_i)² / 10, by Cauchy-Schwarz, since there are 10 terms (for each element in A). So,Σ r_i² ≥ S² / 10Therefore,S² / 10 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1)But S is equal to Σ r_i, which is the total number of elements in all subsets. Let&#39;s denote S = Σ |B_i|, where |B_i| is the size of subset B_i. Each B_i is non-empty, so |B_i| ≥ 1, but again, depending on the sizes of subsets, S can be as large as 10k (if all subsets are the entire set A). However, given the intersection constraints, the subsets cannot be too large, because large subsets would intersect with many others in many elements.This seems a bit tangled. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me consider what is the maximum possible k. If all subsets are pairs (size 2), then the maximum number of subsets such that any two subsets intersect in at most two elements is just the number of pairs, since any two distinct pairs intersect in at most two elements. Wait, but in that case, pairs can intersect in at most one element, not two. Wait, two different pairs can intersect in 0 or 1 elements, not 2. So if we take all 2-element subsets, then any two subsets intersect in at most one element. But in our problem, the intersection is allowed to be up to two elements. So perhaps using larger subsets?Wait, but subsets can be of any size. For example, if we have subsets of size 3, two different subsets can intersect in 0, 1, 2, or 3 elements. But we need that any two subsets intersect in at most two elements. So subsets of size 3 are allowed, as long as no two share all three elements. Similarly, subsets of larger size would need to not overlap too much.But this seems complicated. Maybe there is a standard construction or bound for this.Alternatively, let me think of the problem as analogous to a graph. In a graph, edges are pairs of vertices, and two edges can intersect in at most one vertex. Here, our hyperedges can be of any size, but two hyperedges can intersect in at most two vertices. So it&#39;s a hypergraph with maximum edge intersection 2.I recall that for such hypergraphs, there is a theorem called the Fisher&#39;s inequality or maybe the Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson theorem. Let me recall.The Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson theorem provides bounds on the size of a family of subsets where the intersection of any two subsets is at most t. For our case, t=2. The theorem states that if all subsets have size k, then the maximum number of subsets is C(n, t+1). But in our case, subsets can be of any size. Wait, let me check.Wait, Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson theorem (for t-designs) says that if you have a family of k-element subsets from an n-element set, such that the intersection of any two subsets is at most t, then the maximum number of subsets is at most C(n, t+1). But in our case, subsets can be of any size, so maybe this doesn&#39;t directly apply.Alternatively, the theorem might give an upper bound even if subsets can be of different sizes. Let me check the exact statement.Actually, according to what I recall, the Ray-Chaudhuri-Wilson theorem in its original form applies to uniform hypergraphs (all edges have the same size). But perhaps there is a generalization.Alternatively, maybe we can use the Fisher&#39;s inequality. Fisher&#39;s inequality states that in a block design where each pair of blocks intersects in exactly λ elements, the number of blocks is at least the number of elements. But again, in our case, the intersection is bounded above by 2, not exactly 2.Alternatively, maybe use inclusion matrices or some other method.Alternatively, think in terms of projective planes or finite geometries, but I might be getting off track.Wait, let me return to the inequality I had earlier:Σ r_i² - Σ r_i ≤ 2k(k - 1)But also, by Cauchy-Schwarz, Σ r_i² ≥ (Σ r_i)² / 10.So, substituting:(Σ r_i)² / 10 - Σ r_i ≤ 2k(k - 1)Let’s denote S = Σ r_i, so:S² / 10 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1)But S is the total number of elements in all subsets. If all subsets are as small as possible (size 1), then S = k. If subsets are larger, S increases. To maximize k, we need to find the balance between S and the inequality.But we can also note that S² / 10 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1). Let me rearrange this inequality:S² - 10S ≤ 20k(k - 1)But unless I know more about S, this is difficult. Alternatively, if I can bound S in terms of k, maybe. For example, since each subset is non-empty, S ≥ k. Also, if each subset has at most m elements, then S ≤ mk. But unless we have a bound on m, which we don&#39;t, this might not help.Alternatively, perhaps assume that all subsets have size 3. Then S = 3k, and substituting into the inequality:(3k)² / 10 - 3k ≤ 2k(k - 1)Compute:9k² / 10 - 3k ≤ 2k² - 2kMultiply all terms by 10 to eliminate denominators:9k² - 30k ≤ 20k² - 20kBring all terms to left side:9k² -30k -20k² +20k ≤0Combine like terms:-11k² -10k ≤0Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing inequality):11k² +10k ≥0Which is always true for k ≥0. So this doesn&#39;t give us any useful information. So assuming all subsets are size 3 is not helpful here.Alternatively, maybe try specific constructions. Let&#39;s see. If we take all possible subsets of size ≤2, then any two subsets will intersect in at most two elements (since a subset of size 1 and another subset of size 1 intersect in at most 1 element, a subset of size 1 and size 2 intersect in at most 1 element, and subsets of size 2 can intersect in at most 1 element). Wait, but in this case, the maximum intersection is 1 or 2? Wait, two subsets of size 2 can intersect in 2 elements if they are the same subset. But since the subsets are distinct, two different subsets of size 2 can share at most 1 element. So if we take all subsets of size ≤2, then the maximum intersection between any two distinct subsets is 1 element, which satisfies the condition (since we need at most 2). So this family has size C(10,1) + C(10,2) = 10 + 45 = 55. So k=55.But wait, we can do better. Because the problem allows intersections of up to two elements. So perhaps we can include some subsets of size 3 or more, as long as they don&#39;t intersect with too many others in three elements. Wait, but two subsets of size 3 could intersect in two elements, which is allowed. So maybe if we have subsets of size 3 where each pair intersects in at most two elements. Then adding those might increase k beyond 55.Alternatively, maybe take all subsets of size ≤3. But two subsets of size 3 can intersect in 3 elements, which would violate the condition. So we need to ensure that no two subsets of size 3 are identical, but even different subsets of size 3 can intersect in 3 elements if they share three common elements, but since they are distinct, they can share at most 2 elements. Wait, no. If two distinct subsets of size 3 share 3 elements, then they must be the same subset, which is not allowed. So actually, two distinct subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most 2 elements. Therefore, all subsets of size ≤3 would satisfy the condition that any two distinct subsets intersect in at most 2 elements.Wait, let me confirm. Suppose I have two distinct subsets of size 3. The maximum intersection is 2 elements, right? Because if they share 3 elements, they would be the same subset. So yes, distinct subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most 2 elements. Similarly, a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 2 can intersect in at most 2 elements. A subset of size 3 and a subset of size 1 can intersect in at most 1 element. Similarly for larger subsets.Therefore, if we take all subsets of size ≤3, then the intersection condition is satisfied. The number of such subsets is C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 10 + 45 + 120 = 175. So k=175. But wait, is this correct?Wait, no. Wait, subsets of size 3 can be included, but we have to ensure that any two subsets, regardless of size, intersect in at most two elements. For example, a subset of size 4 and another subset of size 4 could intersect in 3 or 4 elements, which would violate the condition. Similarly, a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 4 could intersect in 3 elements. Therefore, including subsets larger than size 3 might cause problems.Therefore, if we include all subsets of size 1, 2, and 3, then any two subsets will intersect in at most 2 elements only if they are both of size ≤3. But if we have a subset of size 4, then a subset of size 4 and a subset of size 3 could intersect in 3 elements, which is not allowed. So actually, if we include subsets larger than 3, we have to be careful.Hence, if we restrict ourselves to all subsets of size ≤3, then the pairwise intersections are at most 2. Because:- Two subsets of size 1: intersect in 0 or 1 elements.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 2: intersect in 0 or 1 elements.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 3: intersect in 0 or 1 elements.- Two subsets of size 2: intersect in 0 or 1 elements.- A subset of size 2 and a subset of size 3: intersect in 0, 1, or 2 elements.- Two subsets of size 3: intersect in 0, 1, or 2 elements.Thus, in this family, the maximum intersection is 2, which is allowed. Therefore, all subsets of size ≤3 form a valid family. The number of such subsets is C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 10 + 45 + 120 = 175.But maybe we can do even better by including some larger subsets as long as they don&#39;t intersect too much with others. For example, if we can include some subsets of size 4 or more, provided that they don&#39;t share more than two elements with any other subset. However, designing such a family would require careful construction.Alternatively, maybe the maximum k is achieved by taking all subsets of size ≤3, giving 175. But let me verify this.Wait, another thought. If we take all subsets of size 3, how does that affect things? If we have all 3-element subsets, then the number is C(10,3)=120. But if we also include all 2-element and 1-element subsets, that adds 45 + 10 = 55, totaling 175. But is there a way to include more subsets by perhaps mixing in some larger subsets?Suppose we try to include some 4-element subsets. Let&#39;s say we include a 4-element subset, say {0,1,2,3}. Now, any other subset in the family can intersect with this subset in at most 2 elements. So any subset we include must not have more than two elements in common with {0,1,2,3}. For example, a subset like {0,1,4} would be okay, since it intersects in two elements. But a subset like {0,1,2,4} would intersect in three elements with {0,1,2,3}, which is not allowed. So we cannot have any subset that contains three elements from {0,1,2,3} along with other elements.But if we include a 4-element subset, we have to exclude all subsets that have a 3-element intersection with it. However, previously, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 didn&#39;t have any 4-element subsets, so maybe we can include some 4-element subsets as long as they don&#39;t conflict with existing subsets.But this seems complicated. Each time we add a larger subset, we have to ensure it doesn&#39;t intersect existing subsets too much, which might require removing some subsets or carefully choosing which ones to include.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a better upper bound on k. Let&#39;s go back to the inequality we had earlier.We had:Σ r_i² ≤ 2k(k - 1) + Σ r_iBut Σ r_i = S, the total number of elements in all subsets. Let&#39;s denote that as S.So Σ r_i² ≤ 2k(k - 1) + SBut also, by Cauchy-Schwarz:(Σ r_i)² ≤ 10 * Σ r_i²Therefore,S² ≤ 10 * Σ r_i²Substituting the previous inequality:S² ≤ 10 * [2k(k - 1) + S]So,S² ≤ 20k(k - 1) + 10SRearranged:S² - 10S - 20k(k - 1) ≤ 0This is a quadratic inequality in terms of S. Let me write it as:S² - 10S - 20k² + 20k ≤ 0But solving this inequality for S given k is not straightforward. Alternatively, if we can bound S in terms of k, we might find a relationship between S and k.Alternatively, perhaps assume that all subsets are of size 3. Then S = 3k. Substitute into the inequality:(3k)² - 10*(3k) -20k² +20k ≤0Compute:9k² -30k -20k² +20k ≤0Combine terms:-11k² -10k ≤0Which is always true for k ≥0, which gives no information. Hmm, same as before.Alternatively, maybe think of the case where all subsets are 4-element subsets. But as I saw earlier, adding a 4-element subset restricts other subsets. But maybe a specific design exists.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the problem as a graph where each subset is a vertex, and two vertices are connected if their subsets intersect in more than two elements. Then we need an independent set in this graph. But finding the maximum independent set is hard, so this might not be helpful.Alternatively, use the inclusion-exclusion principle. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of coding theory. Each subset can be represented as a 10-dimensional binary vector, where each coordinate indicates the presence or absence of an element. The condition that two subsets intersect in at most two elements translates to the dot product of their vectors being at most 2. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of binary vectors with pairwise dot product at most 2. This is similar to a code with certain inner product constraints. There might be known bounds for such codes.In coding theory, binary codes with bounded pairwise dot products (or equivalently, bounded Hamming distances) have been studied. For instance, the Johnson bound or the Singleton bound. However, I&#39;m not sure of the exact application here.Alternatively, consider that each subset corresponds to a vector in the binary space, and the inner product (mod 2) is the size of the intersection. Wait, actually, the dot product over integers is exactly the size of the intersection. So we have a set of binary vectors with pairwise dot products ≤2. The question is to find the maximum number of such vectors in 10 dimensions.In coding theory terms, this is a binary code with maximum pairwise dot product 2. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a standard name for such codes, but perhaps related to constant-weight codes or codes with certain correlation constraints.I did a quick search in my mind, and I recall that for binary codes with maximum correlation (dot product) t, the maximum size is related to the Johnson bound or the Fisher&#39;s inequality. But I don&#39;t remember exact results.Alternatively, perhaps use the idea of orthogonal arrays, but again, not sure.Alternatively, another approach: Let&#39;s fix a particular element, say element 0. How many subsets can include element 0? Suppose there are r₀ subsets containing 0. Each of these subsets can include 0 and other elements. However, if two subsets both contain 0, their intersection already includes 0. So to satisfy the intersection at most two elements, any two subsets containing 0 can share at most one more element besides 0.Wait, let me elaborate. Suppose we have two subsets B and C that both contain element 0. Then B ∩ C can have at most two elements. Since they both contain 0, they can share at most one additional element. So, in other words, the subsets containing 0 must form a family where any two subsets share at most one element besides 0.This is similar to a code with maximum intersection 1 on the remaining 9 elements. So, for the element 0, the number of subsets containing 0 is bounded by the maximum number of subsets on a 9-element set where any two subsets intersect in at most 1 element. This is similar to a pairwise balanced design.For a set of size 9, the maximum number of subsets where any two intersect in at most 1 element is given by the Fisher&#39;s inequality or the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem. Wait, the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for intersection size ≤1. The Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for maximum intersection t gives the maximum number of subsets of size k when n ≥ 2k - t. But here, our subsets can be of any size.Alternatively, if all subsets containing 0 are pairs (0 and another element), then there are 9 such subsets, and any two intersect only in 0. So their intersection is {0}, which is size 1. If we allow subsets containing 0 of larger size, then we have to ensure that any two such subsets share at most one other element.For example, if we have subsets {0,1,2}, {0,3,4}, {0,5,6}, etc., each pair shares only 0. So if we structure the subsets containing 0 as either pairs or triples that don&#39;t overlap in other elements, then we can have multiple subsets containing 0.Alternatively, if we model the other elements (1-9) as a projective plane, but that might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, for the subsets containing 0, if we consider them as edges in a graph on the remaining 9 vertices where each edge is a subset of size 2 (just 0 and another element) or larger. But to ensure that any two edges intersect in at most one element (other than 0), we can use a graph where each pair of edges shares at most one vertex. That is, a linear hypergraph.In hypergraph terminology, a linear hypergraph is a hypergraph where any two hyperedges intersect in at most one vertex. So, for the subsets containing 0, if we structure them as a linear hypergraph on the remaining 9 elements, then we can have as many subsets as the number of edges in such a hypergraph.The maximum number of edges in a linear hypergraph on 9 vertices is an open problem, but for 2-uniform hypergraphs (simple graphs), the maximum number of edges is C(9,2)=36, but in a linear hypergraph allowing larger edges, the maximum might be higher.Wait, but if we allow edges of size 2 or more, but any two edges share at most one vertex, then the maximum number of edges is similar to the concept of a &quot;matching&quot; in a hypergraph, but more general.However, in our case, the hyperedges can be of any size, but must intersect in at most one vertex. For 9 elements, the maximum number of subsets (hyperedges) where any two subsets share at most one element.This is a well-known problem in extremal set theory. The maximum number is given by C(9,1) + C(9,2) = 9 + 36 = 45. Wait, but that&#39;s if all subsets are of size 1 or 2. If we allow larger subsets, can we have more?No, because if you have a subset of size 3, say {a,b,c}, then you cannot have any other subset that contains two of these elements. So adding a subset of size 3 would require removing some pairs. So the maximum is likely achieved by using all pairs and singletons. But actually, in our case, singletons would be subsets {0, a}, which are actually pairs. Wait, no.Wait, in the context of subsets containing 0, each subset is of the form {0} union something. So if the subsets containing 0 are structured as {0} union a subset of the remaining 9 elements. To ensure that any two such subsets share at most one element besides 0, the &quot;something&quot; parts must be subsets that pairwise intersect in at most one element.So, if we model the &quot;something&quot; parts as a hypergraph on 9 elements with pairwise intersections at most 1, then the maximum number of hyperedges is the quantity we need. This is again a hypergraph with maximum degree 1 intersection.According to the Fisher-type inequality, the maximum number of subsets in such a hypergraph is C(9,1) + C(9,2) = 9 + 36 = 45. Because if you have all single elements and all pairs, they intersect in at most one element. However, if you include a triple, you have to exclude all pairs that are subsets of the triple, which might reduce the total count.Alternatively, according to the theorem by de Bruijn and Tengbergen, which states that for a hypergraph on n vertices with all edges of size ≥2 and pairwise intersections at most 1, the maximum number of edges is C(n,2). But in our case, edges can include singletons (size 1), but since we are considering subsets containing 0, the &quot;something&quot; parts can be singletons or larger. Wait, actually, the &quot;something&quot; parts can be empty (but the subsets must be non-empty, so the &quot;something&quot; part can&#39;t be empty because 0 is already included). So the &quot;something&quot; part must be at least size 1.Therefore, the hypergraph on 9 elements where each hyperedge is a non-empty subset, and any two hyperedges intersect in at most 1 element. The maximum number of hyperedges is C(9,1) + C(9,2) = 45. Because if you include any hyperedge of size ≥3, you have to exclude some pairs or singletons.Therefore, for the subsets containing 0, the maximum number is 45. Similarly, for subsets containing 1, subsets containing 2, etc. But if we try to do this for all elements, we have to consider overlaps.Wait, but this is the problem. If we consider subsets containing 0, we can have up to 45 subsets (including 0 and any singleton or pair from the remaining 9 elements). But if we do the same for subsets containing 1, we might overlap with subsets containing 0.Therefore, this approach might lead to overcounting. So perhaps we need a different strategy.Alternatively, use the probabilistic method to estimate the maximum k. But that might be too vague.Alternatively, look for known results. I recall that the maximum number of subsets of an n-element set with pairwise intersections at most t is C(n,0) + C(n,1) + ... + C(n,t+1). But in our case, t=2, so the maximum k would be C(10,0)+C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3) = 1 +10+45+120=176. Wait, but this is the same as all subsets of size ≤3 except the empty set. But we already considered that, which is 175 subsets (excluding the empty set). But the user specified non-empty subsets, so 175.But in the example, the answer might be 175. But I need to verify if this is indeed the maximum. Let me check whether there&#39;s a known theorem for this.Yes, I think that in general, for a family of subsets where each pair intersects in at most t elements, the maximum size is indeed the sum of binomial coefficients up to C(n, t+1). This is known as the Sauer-Shelah lemma, but actually the Sauer-Shelah lemma is about shattering and VC-dimension. Maybe not exactly.Wait, another thought. If we consider the family of all subsets of size at most t+1, then any two subsets in this family intersect in at most t elements. Because the intersection of two subsets is at most the size of the smaller subset. So if all subsets have size at most t+1, then their intersection is at most t+1, but actually, we need the intersection to be at most t. Wait, no.Wait, suppose t=2. Then, if all subsets have size at most 3, two subsets can intersect in up to 3 elements, which would violate the t=2 condition. Wait, no. If two subsets have size 3, their intersection can be up to 3, but they have to be distinct subsets, so the intersection can be at most 2 elements. Wait, hold on. If two distinct subsets each have size 3, they can share up to 2 elements, because if they share 3 elements, they would be the same subset. So in fact, two distinct subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most 2 elements. Similarly, a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 4 can intersect in at most 3 elements, which would violate the t=2 condition. Therefore, if we include subsets larger than size 3, we have to be careful.Hence, if we take all subsets of size at most 3, then any two distinct subsets will intersect in at most 2 elements. Because:- Subsets of size 1 and 2: intersect in at most 1 element.- Subsets of size 1 and 3: intersect in at most 1 element.- Subsets of size 2 and 2: intersect in at most 1 element.- Subsets of size 2 and 3: intersect in at most 2 elements.- Subsets of size 3 and 3: intersect in at most 2 elements.Therefore, this family satisfies the condition. The number of subsets is C(10,1)+C(10,2)+C(10,3) = 10+45+120=175.But if we include any subset of size 4, say, then a subset of size 4 and a subset of size 3 can intersect in 3 elements, which violates the condition. Therefore, to include a subset of size 4, we would have to ensure that it doesn&#39;t share three elements with any other subset. However, since there are already subsets of size 3 in the family, adding a subset of size 4 that contains one of those subsets of size 3 would result in an intersection of size 3, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot add any subset of size 4 or larger without violating the intersection condition.Therefore, the family of all subsets of size at most 3 is the largest possible family where any two subsets intersect in at most 2 elements, giving k=175. However, I need to check if there is a way to include some larger subsets without violating the intersection condition, which might allow k to be larger than 175.Suppose we try to construct a family that includes some 4-element subsets. Let&#39;s say we include a 4-element subset B = {a,b,c,d}. Then, any other subset in the family must not intersect B in more than two elements. Therefore, any subset that contains three elements from B cannot be in the family. However, in our current family of all subsets of size ≤3, there are subsets of size 3 that are contained within B. For example, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, etc. Each of these subsets intersects B in 3 elements, which is not allowed. Therefore, to include B in the family, we must exclude all subsets of size 3 that are subsets of B. There are C(4,3)=4 such subsets. So by adding one 4-element subset, we have to remove 4 subsets of size 3. Therefore, the net change in k is +1 -4 = -3. This decreases the total k, so it&#39;s not beneficial.Alternatively, suppose we remove all subsets of size 3 and replace them with larger subsets. For example, if we remove all subsets of size 3 (120 subsets) and replace them with as many 4-element subsets as possible. Each 4-element subset can intersect with others in at most two elements. How many 4-element subsets can we have such that any two intersect in at most two elements?This is similar to a code with constant weight 4 and maximum intersection 2. The maximum number of such subsets is given by C(10,4)/C(4,2) = 210 /6 = 35. Wait, no, this is if we have a Steiner system S(4,2,10), but such a system might not exist.Alternatively, use the Fisher&#39;s inequality for block designs. A 2-(10,4,λ) design would have each pair of elements contained in λ blocks. However, our condition is that any two blocks intersect in at most two elements, which is a different constraint. It’s more like a block design with block size 4 and pairwise intersection ≤2. The maximum number of such blocks is an open problem, but estimates can be made.The maximum number of 4-element subsets of a 10-element set with pairwise intersections at most 2 is bounded by the Fisher-type inequality. According to the Johnson bound, for a code of length n, constant weight w, and maximum pairwise intersection t, the maximum size A(n,w,t) is ≤ C(n, t+1)/C(w, t+1). For n=10, w=4, t=2:A(10,4,2) ≤ C(10,3)/C(4,3) = 120 /4 = 30.So the maximum number of 4-element subsets is at most 30. But even if we could have 30 such subsets, replacing the 120 subsets of size 3 with 30 subsets of size 4 would result in a net loss of 90 subsets, which is not beneficial.Therefore, including larger subsets doesn&#39;t seem to help in increasing k beyond 175.Alternatively, maybe use a mixed approach: include some subsets of size 3 and some of size 4, carefully arranged so that they don&#39;t intersect too much. However, this would require intricate construction and it&#39;s unclear if such a family would surpass 175 in size.Given that constructing such a family is non-trivial and that the family of all subsets of size ≤3 already gives,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have set A = {0,1,2,...,9}, which is 10 elements. We have a family of subsets {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ}, each of which is non-empty. The condition is that when i ≠ j, the intersection of B_i and B_j has at most two elements. We need to find the maximum possible value of k, which is the largest number of such subsets we can have under these conditions.First, I should recall some combinatorial principles. This seems related to combinatorial design theory, maybe something like block designs where intersections are controlled. But I&#39;m not exactly sure. Let me think.The problem is similar to finding a family of subsets with bounded pairwise intersections. In combinatorics, there are known results for such problems. For example, Fisher&#39;s inequality or the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, but those usually deal with intersecting families where every pair intersects in at least some number. Here, it&#39;s the opposite: every pair intersects in at most two elements.Wait, so we need subsets where no two subsets share more than two elements. So each subset can be of any size (since they just need to be non-empty), but the intersection of any two is ≤2. And we need to maximize the number of such subsets. Hmm. So maybe the maximum k is related to the number of all possible subsets minus those that would violate the intersection condition. But that approach might be too vague.Alternatively, think about how many subsets can we have such that each pair shares at most two elements. Maybe we can use some counting argument here. Let me try.Suppose each subset is a 3-element subset. Then, the intersection of any two can be at most two elements, which satisfies the condition. But if we use larger subsets, say 4 elements, then two such subsets could potentially intersect in three elements, which would violate the condition. So maybe if we restrict ourselves to 3-element subsets, we can have a family where all intersections are ≤2. Then, the maximum k would be the number of 3-element subsets, which is C(10,3) = 120. But wait, but if we use all 3-element subsets, then actually some pairs of them will intersect in two elements, but others might intersect in one or zero. Since the condition allows intersections up to two elements, then actually all 3-element subsets would be okay. But the problem allows subsets of any size, as long as they are non-empty. So perhaps we can have more subsets if we also include some larger subsets, as long as they don&#39;t intersect too much with others. Wait, but if we include a 4-element subset, then we have to make sure that it doesn&#39;t intersect any other subset in more than two elements. So if we already have some subsets, adding a 4-element subset would require that it doesn&#39;t share three elements with any existing subset. So maybe including larger subsets would limit the number of subsets we can have overall. Maybe sticking to smaller subsets allows more subsets.Alternatively, maybe a mixture of subsets of different sizes can be arranged in such a way that all pairwise intersections are at most two. But how?Alternatively, think of each subset as a vector in a vector space over some field, where the intersection corresponds to the dot product. But maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating.Another approach: Let me consider the problem in terms of graph theory. Each subset is a vertex, and we connect two vertices if their intersection has size &gt;2. Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. However, the graph is enormous since the number of subsets is 2^10 -1 = 1023, so this approach is not practical.Alternatively, use inclusion-exclusion or other combinatorial bounds.Wait, maybe there&#39;s an upper bound we can apply here. Let&#39;s think about the Fisher&#39;s inequality or the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem. Wait, the classic Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem gives the maximum family of k-element subsets where every pair intersects in at least t elements. But here we have the opposite: we want every pair to intersect in at most t elements, which is 2. So maybe we can use the theorem in reverse?Alternatively, use the concept of a pairwise intersecting family with bounded intersections.Alternatively, think about projective planes or block designs where blocks intersect in a fixed number of points, but here it&#39;s a maximum rather than a fixed number.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the inclusion matrices or set systems with bounded pairwise intersections.Wait, here&#39;s a theorem I recall: In a set system where each pair of sets intersects in at most t elements, the maximum number of subsets is bounded by something related to the total number of elements. Maybe something like the sum over the binomial coefficients?Wait, perhaps the answer is related to the sum_{i=1}^3 C(10, i). Let me check. If we take all subsets of size at most 2, then any two subsets will intersect in at most 1 element if they are singletons, or 2 elements if they are both pairs. Wait, if we take all subsets of size ≤2, then the intersections are at most 2. Wait, but in that case, two subsets of size 2 can intersect in at most 2 elements, which is allowed. Wait, but if we take all subsets of size ≤2, then the total number is C(10,1) + C(10,2) = 10 + 45 = 55. But can we have more subsets?Wait, but the problem allows subsets of any size, as long as their pairwise intersections are at most 2. So if we include subsets of size 3 or more, as long as they don&#39;t intersect other subsets in more than 2 elements. So maybe we can add some subsets of larger size.Alternatively, another upper bound: For each element in the set A, how many subsets can contain it? If two subsets share three elements, then they must not be both in the family. But since the intersection is limited to two elements, perhaps we can use a counting method.Alternatively, consider the problem using the probabilistic method. But maybe that&#39;s too advanced.Wait, let me think about the following. Let&#39;s suppose that we have a family F of subsets where every two subsets intersect in at most two elements. We need to find the maximum size of F.In literature, this is known as a family of subsets with pairwise intersections bounded by t=2. For such a problem, there is a well-known upper bound called the Fisher-type inequality or the Johnson bound.Wait, here&#39;s a bound called the Fisher&#39;s inequality which in design theory states that the number of blocks is at least the number of elements, but that&#39;s for certain types of designs.Alternatively, the theorem that might be useful here is the one given by the inclusion-exclusion principle, or more specifically, the result known as the &quot;pairwise intersecting family&quot; with bounded intersections.Alternatively, use the concept of the inclusion matrix. Wait, let&#39;s recall that the maximum number of subsets of an n-element set with pairwise intersections at most t is given by the sum of binomial coefficients from 0 to t+1. Wait, that might not be accurate.Wait, actually, in the case where all subsets are of size greater than t+1, but here subsets can be of any size. Let me check.Wait, here&#39;s a standard result called the Sauer-Shelah lemma, which gives the maximum size of a set system with VC dimension d, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s directly applicable here.Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each subset is a vertex and edges represent intersections larger than two. Then, the problem is to find the maximum independent set in this graph. But as before, the graph is too big to handle directly.Alternatively, use double counting. Let&#39;s consider the number of ordered triples (B_i, B_j, x) where x is in both B_i and B_j, and i &lt; j. Each pair (B_i, B_j) can contribute at most 2 elements x, so the total number of such triples is at most C(k,2)*2. On the other hand, each element x is contained in C(f_x,2) pairs of subsets, where f_x is the number of subsets containing x. Therefore, the total number of triples is also equal to the sum over x in A of C(f_x,2). Therefore, we have:Sum_{x=0}^9 C(f_x, 2) ≤ C(k,2)*2.This inequality might help us bound k.Yes, this is similar to the approach used in the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem, using double counting.So let&#39;s denote f_x as the number of subsets in the family that contain element x. Then, for each x, the number of pairs of subsets that contain x is C(f_x, 2). Since any two subsets can share at most two elements, the total over all x of C(f_x, 2) is ≤ C(k,2)*2.So:Sum_{x=0}^9 [f_x choose 2] ≤ [k choose 2] * 2.Let me write that as:Sum_{x=0}^9 (f_x(f_x - 1)/2) ≤ (k(k - 1)/2)*2.Multiplying both sides by 2:Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x(f_x - 1) ≤ k(k - 1)*2.So, we have:Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x^2 - Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x ≤ 2k(k - 1).But Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x is equal to the total number of element occurrences across all subsets, which we can denote as S. So S = Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x.Therefore:Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x^2 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1).Now, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have that:Sum_{x=0}^9 f_x^2 ≥ (S^2)/10.Therefore,(S^2)/10 - S ≤ 2k(k - 1).But we need to relate S and k. However, S is the total number of element occurrences. If each subset is non-empty, then S is at least k (if every subset has exactly one element). But subsets can be larger, so S can be larger.But if we consider that to maximize k, we might want to minimize S, i.e., use as few elements per subset as possible. Because if subsets are small, S is smaller, but maybe allows more subsets. Alternatively, if subsets are larger, S is larger, but maybe we can&#39;t have as many subsets.But perhaps this is not straightforward.Alternatively, we can use the inequality:Sum f_x^2 ≥ S^2 / 10.Therefore,S^2 /10 - S ≤ 2k(k -1).So:S^2 -10S ≤ 20k(k -1).But S is the total number of elements in all subsets. Let’s suppose that all subsets are singletons. Then, S = k. Then, substituting:k^2 -10k ≤ 20k(k -1)k^2 -10k ≤ 20k^2 -20k0 ≤19k^2 -10kWhich is always true for k ≥1. But this doesn&#39;t give us a useful bound. So perhaps this approach is not tight enough.Alternatively, suppose that all subsets are pairs (2-element subsets). Then, each subset contributes 2 to S, so S = 2k. Then:(2k)^2 /10 -2k ≤ 2k(k -1)Which is:4k² /10 -2k ≤ 2k² -2kSimplify:(2k²/5) -2k ≤ 2k² -2kSubtract left side from right side:2k² -2k -2k²/5 +2k = (10k² -2k²)/5 = 8k²/5 ≥0Which is true, but again, not helpful. So perhaps even if we use pairs, the inequality is satisfied but doesn&#39;t bound k.Alternatively, maybe use a different approach. Let&#39;s think about the maximum possible k.If we take all subsets of size at most 2, then the family has C(10,1) + C(10,2) = 10 +45=55 subsets. Any two subsets in this family intersect in at most 2 elements. So 55 is a lower bound.But the problem asks for the maximum k. So maybe we can do better by including some larger subsets carefully.Suppose we include some 3-element subsets. Let&#39;s say we include one 3-element subset {a,b,c}. Now, we have to ensure that this subset does not intersect any other subset in more than two elements. But all the existing subsets in the family of size at most 2 can only intersect {a,b,c} in at most 2 elements, since they themselves have size 1 or 2. So actually, adding a 3-element subset is safe. Similarly, adding multiple 3-element subsets, as long as any two 3-element subsets don&#39;t intersect in more than two elements. Wait, but if we have two 3-element subsets that share three elements, that would violate the condition. So to add multiple 3-element subsets, we need them to intersect each other in at most two elements. So if we have a family of 3-element subsets where every two intersect in at most two elements, then combining them with all subsets of size ≤2 would give a larger family.But how many 3-element subsets can we have such that any two intersect in at most two elements? That&#39;s equivalent to a family of 3-element subsets with pairwise intersections ≤2. But such a family can include all possible 3-element subsets, since any two distinct 3-element subsets intersect in at most 2 elements. Wait, yes! If you take any two distinct 3-element subsets, their intersection can be at most 2 elements. So actually, the family of all 3-element subsets already satisfies that any two intersect in ≤2 elements. Therefore, if we take all subsets of size ≤3, but wait, no, because some 3-element subsets may intersect with other 3-element subsets in 2 elements, which is allowed, but subsets of size 3 can also intersect with larger subsets (if we had any) in more than two elements. But if we only take subsets of size ≤3, then any two subsets would intersect in at most 3 elements, but since we need intersections to be at most 2, we cannot take all subsets of size ≤3. For example, two 3-element subsets could intersect in 3 elements, which would be a problem. Wait, no. Wait, two distinct 3-element subsets can intersect in at most 2 elements. If two subsets are distinct and both have size 3, they can share 0,1,2 elements. So actually, if we take all 3-element subsets, then their pairwise intersections are ≤2. Therefore, if we take all subsets of size ≤3, then the pairwise intersections would still be ≤3, which is too much. Wait, no. Wait, subsets of size 1, 2, or 3. If I take two subsets of size 3, their intersection is at most 2. If I take a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 1, their intersection is at most 1. Similarly, a subset of size 3 and a subset of size 2 can intersect in at most 2. So actually, all subsets of size ≤3 would satisfy the condition that pairwise intersections are at most 2. Wait, hold on. Suppose I have a subset of size 3, {a,b,c}, and another subset of size 3, {a,b,c,d}. Wait, but the second subset is of size 4. Wait, no, in this case, if we take subsets of size up to 3, the maximum size is 3. So two subsets of size 3 can intersect in at most 2 elements if they are distinct, right? Wait, no. If two subsets of size 3 are identical, their intersection is 3, but since subsets are distinct, they must differ by at least one element. Therefore, two distinct 3-element subsets can intersect in at most 2 elements. Therefore, all subsets of size ≤3 can be included, because any two distinct subsets will intersect in at most 2 elements. Wait, but the problem states that the family consists of non-empty subsets, with any two distinct subsets intersecting in at most two elements. So if we take all subsets of size 1,2,3, then yes, any two distinct subsets will intersect in at most 2 elements, because:- Two subsets of size 1: intersect in 0 or 1 elements.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 2: intersect in 0 or 1.- A subset of size 1 and a subset of size 3: intersect in 0 or 1.- Two subsets of size 2: intersect in 0,1, or 2.- A subset of size 2 and a subset of size 3: intersect in 0,1, or 2.- Two subsets of size 3: intersect in 0,1, or 2.So in all cases, intersections are at most 2. Therefore, the family of all subsets of A with size ≤3 satisfies the condition. Therefore, the number of subsets in this family is C(10,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,3) = 10 +45 +120 = 175. So 175 is a possible value of k. But can we do better?Wait, but the problem allows subsets of any size, not just up to 3. So if we include a subset of size 4, say {a,b,c,d}, we need to make sure that it doesn&#39;t intersect any other subset in more than two elements. But if we have already included all subsets of size ≤3, then the subset {a,b,c,d} will intersect with subsets like {a,b,c} (a 3-element subset) in 3 elements, which violates the condition. Therefore, we cannot include any subsets of size 4 or more if we have already included all subsets of size ≤3.Therefore, if we want to include some subsets of size 4, we need to remove some subsets of size 3 that intersect with them in 3 elements. But this might not be beneficial because adding one subset of size 4 would require removing multiple subsets of size 3, which might result in a net loss.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a better family that includes some larger subsets along with smaller ones, arranged in such a way that no two subsets intersect too much. But constructing such a family might be complex.Alternatively, perhaps the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is actually the maximum possible. Let&#39;s see. The total number is 175. Is this the maximum?Wait, but I need to check if there&#39;s a way to include more subsets without violating the intersection condition. For example, if we take all subsets of size ≤3, that&#39;s 175. If we can find a way to add some subsets of size 4 without conflicting, maybe k can be higher.But as I thought before, adding a subset of size 4 would conflict with all existing 3-element subsets that are contained within it. For example, if I add {a,b,c,d}, then all subsets {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d}, {b,c,d} are 3-element subsets that intersect with it in 3 elements, which is not allowed. So to add {a,b,c,d}, I need to remove those four 3-element subsets. But then, removing four subsets to add one might not be beneficial.Alternatively, maybe if we create a design where subsets of size 4 are arranged so that they don&#39;t share too many elements with each other or with smaller subsets. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum k is indeed 175, given by all subsets of size at most 3. But let&#39;s check the literature. Wait, in combinatorics, the family of all subsets of size at most t+1 is a family where any two subsets intersect in at most t elements. Here, t=2, so subsets of size at most 3. Therefore, this family has size Sum_{i=1}^3 C(10,i) = 175. But is this the maximum possible?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a better construction. Let me think about projective planes or other combinatorial structures.Wait, another idea: consider that each element can be part of multiple subsets, but we have to limit how many subsets share the same trio of elements. However, since any two subsets can share at most two elements, maybe we can model this as a hypergraph where each hyperedge has size ≥1 and any two hyperedges share at most two vertices. Then, the problem is to find the maximum number of hyperedges in such a hypergraph.But hypergraph theory is complex, and I might not remember exact results. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is indeed the sum of binomial coefficients up to 3, which is 175. But let me verify.Suppose we try to add a 4-element subset. As mentioned, it would conflict with the 4 subsets of size 3 that it contains. If we remove those 4 subsets, we can add 1 subset. So net change is -3. Not helpful. Similarly, adding a 5-element subset would require removing C(5,3)=10 subsets of size 3, which is worse. Therefore, including larger subsets reduces the total number.Alternatively, what if we don&#39;t include all subsets of size 3, but only some of them, so that we can include some larger subsets? Maybe there&#39;s a balance here. But this would require intricate construction, and it&#39;s not obvious. For example, if we partition the set A into groups and arrange subsets within each group, but this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, use the upper bound from the double counting inequality we had earlier.Recall that we had:Sum_{x=0}^9 [f_x choose 2] ≤ [k choose 2] * 2.If we can compute the left-hand side for the family of all subsets of size ≤3, then compare it to the right-hand side, we can see if the inequality is tight or if there is room for more subsets.So, for the family of all subsets of size ≤3, each element x is contained in:- C(9,0) subsets of size 1: 1 (just {x} itself)- C(9,1) subsets of size 2: 9 (pairing x with each of the other 9 elements)- C(9,2) subsets of size 3: 36 (choosing 2 other elements from the remaining 9)Therefore, each f_x = 1 +9 +36 =46.Therefore, Sum_{x=0}^9 [f_x choose 2] =10* [46*45/2] =10*(1035)=10350.On the other hand, [k choose 2]*2 = [175 choose 2]*2 = (175*174/2)*2 =175*174=30450.So 10350 ≤30450, which holds. Therefore, the inequality is not tight. Therefore, there might be room for more subsets. Wait, but how?But this seems contradictory, because if we already included all subsets of size ≤3, which gives k=175, and the inequality allows for a larger k. But according to the problem statement, the answer might be higher. Wait, but maybe not. Because the inequality is just an upper bound, not necessarily achievable.Wait, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s compute the left-hand side for the all-subsets-of-size-≤3 family. We had each f_x=46, so Sum [f_x choose 2] =10*(46*45)/2=10*1035=10350. The right-hand side is [k choose 2]*2= (k^2 -k). So the inequality is 10350 ≤k(k -1). If k=175, 175*174=30450, which is much larger than 10350. Therefore, this family does not saturate the inequality. Therefore, according to the inequality, potentially a larger k is possible.Therefore, the upper bound from this inequality is actually higher. Let me see. If we have Sum [f_x choose 2] ≤k(k -1). Suppose we set Sum [f_x choose 2] =k(k -1). Then, for maximum k, we need to maximize k such that 10*(f_x choose 2) ≤k(k -1). But since each f_x can vary, but the total sum is related to the distribution of f_x.Alternatively, to maximize k, we can consider the case where the f_x are as equal as possible. Let&#39;s suppose that each element is contained in roughly the same number of subsets. Let’s let f_x = t for all x. Then, Sum [f_x choose 2] =10*[t(t-1)/2] =5t(t-1). So 5t(t-1) ≤k(k -1). Also, S = Sum f_x =10t. But S is also the total number of elements in all subsets. If the average subset size is d, then S= dk. So 10t = dk. But since subsets can be of any size, d can vary. However, if we assume that all subsets are of size 3, then d=3, so 10t=3k, so t=(3k)/10. Then, substituting into the inequality:5*(3k/10)*(3k/10 -1) ≤k(k -1)Compute left-hand side:5*( (3k/10)*(3k/10 -1) ) =5*(9k²/100 -3k/10)= (45k²/100 -15k/10)= (9k²/20 - 3k/2)Set this ≤k² -kSo:9k²/20 - 3k/2 ≤k² -kMultiply both sides by 20 to eliminate denominators:9k² -30k ≤20k² -20kBring all terms to left side:9k² -30k -20k² +20k ≤0-11k² -10k ≤0Which is always true since k is positive. So this doesn&#39;t give us a useful upper bound. Therefore, the assumption that all subsets are size 3 is not helpful here.Alternatively, perhaps a different approach. Let me consider the problem from the perspective of the inclusion of elements. If each element is in t subsets, then the number of pairs of subsets that share that element is C(t,2). Since each pair of subsets can share at most two elements, the total number of pairs sharing any element is Sum_x C(f_x,2) ≤2*C(k,2). But we already considered that.Alternatively, think of it as each pair of subsets can share 0,1, or 2 elements. The total number of intersecting element pairs across all subset pairs is Sum_x C(f_x,2) ≤2*C(k,2).But since each pair of subsets contributes at most 2 elements to the sum, the total is ≤2*C(k,2). So equality would hold if every pair of subsets shares exactly 2 elements. But in reality, many pairs share 0 or 1 elements. Therefore, the left-hand side is much less than the upper bound. Hence, the inequality is not tight, which suggests that perhaps k can be larger than 175. However, the example with all subsets of size ≤3 gives k=175, but according to the inequality, the upper bound is higher. Wait, if we calculate for k=175, Sum_x [f_x choose 2] =10350, and 2*C(175,2)=2*(175*174)/2=175*174=30450. So 10350 ≤30450, so there is a lot of slack. Therefore, maybe we can have a larger family.Alternatively, perhaps consider that each pair of elements can be contained in at most some number of subsets. Wait, if two elements are contained in too many subsets, then subsets containing both could intersect with each other in two elements, but if we have three subsets each containing the same two elements, then any two of them intersect in at least those two elements. Wait, but the condition allows intersections of up to two elements, so actually, multiple subsets can share the same two elements, as long as they don&#39;t share three or more. Wait, but if you have multiple subsets that contain the same two elements, say {a,b}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, then each pair of these subsets intersects in two elements {a,b}, which is allowed. Therefore, there is no restriction on how many subsets can share a pair, as long as they don&#39;t share more than two elements. So actually, the only restriction is that no three elements are common to two subsets. Wait, no. If two subsets share three elements, that&#39;s not allowed, but if multiple subsets share the same pair, that&#39;s okay.Therefore, perhaps we can have more subsets by including multiple subsets that share pairs but differ elsewhere. For example, fix a pair {a,b}, and include many subsets that contain {a,b} and other elements. As long as any two such subsets only share {a,b}, then their intersection is two elements. So, for example, take {a,b}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, ..., {a,b,j}. Each of these subsets intersects with each other in {a,b}, which is allowed. So for one pair {a,b}, we can create 9 subsets: {a,b}, {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, ..., {a,b,j}. That&#39;s 9 subsets. Similarly, for another pair {a,c}, we can do the same. However, if we do this for all pairs, we might get overlaps. For example, the subset {a,b,c} is in both the family for pair {a,b} and pair {a,c} and pair {b,c}. So we have to be careful not to duplicate subsets.Alternatively, perhaps use a structure where each pair is contained in exactly λ subsets. But this is more related to block designs. For example, a Steiner system S(t,k,v) where each t-element subset is contained in exactly one block. But not sure.Alternatively, the problem resembles a 2-design where blocks have size varying, but pairwise intersections are limited.Alternatively, think of each subset as a vector in a binary vector space, where each coordinate corresponds to an element of A, and a subset is represented by a 0-1 vector. The intersection of two subsets is the dot product of their vectors. The condition is that the dot product is ≤2. We need the maximum number of vectors with this property.This is similar to coding theory, where the maximum number of codewords with pairwise dot product ≤2. In coding theory terms, binary codes with maximum pairwise inner product. There might be known bounds for this.In coding theory, for binary codes of length n=10, with maximum pairwise inner product (number of overlapping 1s) ≤2. The question is, what&#39;s the maximum size of such a code? This seems related.According to the Johnson bound or the Fisher&#39;s inequality, there might be results. Alternatively, the maximum size is related to the sum of binomial coefficients C(n,0)+C(n,1)+C(n,2), but in this case, it&#39;s 1+10+45=56, which is less than 175. So that approach isn&#39;t directly applicable.Wait, but in coding theory, for binary codes with constant weight w and maximum pairwise intersection t, there are bounds, but here the code can have variable weight.Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of binary vectors of length 10 (with no all-zero vectors) such that any two vectors have inner product ≤2. This is called a &quot;code with bounded pairwise dot product&quot;.A quick recall: For binary codes, the maximum size is not exactly known in general, but some bounds exist. For instance, the Johnson bound for constant-weight codes, but since we allow variable weight, maybe different bounds apply.Alternatively, the set of all vectors with weight ≤3 satisfy the condition since the inner product of any two such vectors is ≤3, but wait, no. If two vectors have weight 3 each, their inner product can be up to 3. For example, if they share three 1s. But in our problem, the inner product must be ≤2. Therefore, the code must have maximum pairwise inner product 2, which means that even constant-weight codes of weight 3 cannot include any two codewords that intersect in 3 ones. Therefore, variable-weight codes can have higher flexibility.Wait, so if we take all binary vectors with weight ≤2, then the inner product between any two is ≤2 (since two vectors with two 1s can intersect in 0,1, or 2). But also, vectors of weight 1 can only intersect in 0 or 1. So this code has maximum inner product 2. The number of such codewords is C(10,1)+C(10,2)=10+45=55.But we already saw that the family of all subsets of size ≤3 gives 175 subsets, but in coding terms, this would correspond to codewords of weight ≤3, but some pairs of codewords would have inner product 3, which is not allowed. Wait, but in coding terms, the inner product is the number of overlapping 1s. So two subsets of size 3 that intersect in 3 elements would correspond to two codewords of weight 3 with inner product 3, which is over the limit. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is actually NOT allowed, because some pairs have inner product 3. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, confusion arises here. Let&#39;s clarify:In the problem statement, it&#39;s specified that when i ≠ j, B_i ∩ B_j has at most two elements. So if two subsets have an intersection of three elements, that&#39;s a violation. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is NOT allowed, because some pairs of subsets (specifically, two subsets of size 3 that share three elements) would intersect in three elements. Therefore, my earlier conclusion was wrong.This is a critical mistake. So, in fact, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is invalid because two subsets of size 3 can intersect in three elements. For example, {1,2,3} and {1,2,3} (but they are the same subset, so duplicates are not allowed), but even two distinct subsets like {1,2,3} and {1,2,4} intersect in two elements. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, two distinct subsets of size 3 must differ by at least one element. So their intersection can be at most 2 elements. For example, {1,2,3} and {1,2,4} intersect in two elements. {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} intersect in zero. {1,2,3} and {1,3,4} intersect in two. Wait, no, {1,2,3} and {1,3,4} intersect in two elements: 1 and 3. Wait, but if you have {1,2,3} and {1,2,3,4}, which is size 4, then their intersection is three elements. But if we only take subsets of size ≤3, then two distinct subsets of size 3 cannot intersect in three elements. Because if they did, they would be identical, which is not allowed. So two distinct subsets of size 3 must differ by at least one element, hence their intersection is at most 2 elements. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is actually allowed, since any two distinct subsets intersect in at most two elements. So my initial thought was correct. So in coding terms, the inner product (number of overlapping 1s) is ≤2 for any two distinct codewords, which is allowed. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is valid and has size 175.But then, why did the coding theory perspective suggest otherwise? Because in coding theory, if you have codewords of weight 3, two codewords can share up to 3 elements if allowed, but in our problem, since subsets are distinct, they can share at most 2. Wait, actually, in coding theory, the inner product counts the number of overlapping 1s, which for two distinct codewords of weight 3 can be up to 3, but only if they are the same codeword. But since codewords are distinct, the maximum overlap is 2. Wait, no. For example, codewords {1,2,3} and {1,2,4} have an inner product of 2 (elements 1 and 2). But if you have codewords {1,2,3} and {1,2,3}, they are the same, so inner product 3, but duplicates are not allowed. Therefore, in the code of all distinct subsets of size ≤3, the maximum inner product is 2, which satisfies the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, the family of all subsets of size ≤3 is valid. Therefore, k=175 is achievable.But according to the earlier upper bound using double counting, the upper limit is much higher. For example, with k=175, the right-hand side of the inequality is 175*174=30450, and the left-hand side was 10350, so there is a lot of slack. Therefore, maybe we can have a larger k by including some subsets of size ≥4, provided they don&#39;t intersect existing subsets in more than two elements.Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that adding a subset of size 4 would require removing subsets of size 3 that are contained within it. For example, adding {a,b,c,d} would conflict with subsets {a,b,c}, {a,b,d}, {a,c,d},]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>Solution: There are 175 subsets of one, two, and three elements, which clearly meet the requirements, so k geqslant 175.Assume k&gt;175, then among left{B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{k}right}, there is at least one subset with more than 3 elements.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A lattice path here is a sequence of points where each consecutive pair of points is one unit apart. So, each step can be either up, down, left, or right? Wait, or is it only certain directions? The problem says &quot;P_{i-1}P_i = 1&quot;, which I think means the Euclidean distance between consecutive points is 1. So, in the plane, moving from one lattice point to another with distance 1 would mean moving either horizontally or vertically by one unit. So, each step is either up, down, left, or right. So, four possible directions each time. But the path starts at (0,0) and ends at some point on the line y=0 after n steps. So, the endpoint has a y-coordinate of 0, but the x-coordinate can be anything. The number of such paths is F(n), and we need to show that F(n) = (2n choose n). Wait, (2n choose n) is the central binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to go from (0,0) to (n,n) in a grid, or the number of Dyck paths, but maybe here it&#39;s different. Let&#39;s think.First, maybe I can model this as a kind of walk on the integer lattice, starting at (0,0), taking n steps, each step being one unit in one of the four cardinal directions, and ending anywhere on the x-axis. But wait, the problem says &quot;distinct paths&quot;. So, the paths are sequences of points, so two paths are different if at any step they go in different directions. So even if they end up at the same point, they are different paths if the sequence of steps is different. But how do I count all such paths that end on y=0? Let&#39;s think about possible approaches.One idea is to use recursion. Maybe express F(n) in terms of smaller F(k). But I need to see how the paths can be built up. Alternatively, maybe using generating functions. Or perhaps a bijection with another known combinatorial structure.Alternatively, think of this as a two-dimensional walk problem, with steps in four directions, and want to count walks of length n starting at (0,0) and ending at (k,0) for some k, and sum over all possible k. Then, F(n) would be the sum over k of the number of walks from (0,0) to (k,0) in n steps. But how do I compute this sum? Let&#39;s try to model it. Each step is either North, South, East, or West. Let&#39;s denote the steps as N, S, E, W. Then, each step is a vector: N is (0,1), S is (0,-1), E is (1,0), W is (-1,0). A path of n steps is a sequence of these vectors, and the total displacement after n steps is the sum of these vectors. The path ends on y=0, so the total displacement in the y-direction must be 0. That is, the number of N steps equals the number of S steps. Because each N contributes +1 to y, each S contributes -1, and E and W don&#39;t affect y. So, to end on y=0, the number of N steps must equal the number of S steps. Let&#39;s denote the number of N steps as k, then the number of S steps is also k, and the remaining n - 2k steps are either E or W. The total displacement in the x-direction is then (number of E steps) - (number of W steps). But since we don&#39;t care about the final x-coordinate, just that it&#39;s on y=0, we need to count all such paths where the number of N equals the number of S, regardless of the E and W steps.Therefore, for each k from 0 to floor(n/2), the number of paths with k N&#39;s, k S&#39;s, and (n - 2k) steps that are E or W. For each such k, the number of paths is (n choose k, k, n - 2k) multiplied by 2^{n - 2k}, since the remaining steps can be either E or W. Wait, let me check:The total number of steps is n. If we have k N&#39;s, k S&#39;s, and m = n - 2k E/W&#39;s. The number of ways to choose the positions of the N&#39;s, S&#39;s, and E/W&#39;s is the multinomial coefficient: n! / (k! k! m!). Then, for each of the m steps that are E or W, there are 2 choices (E or W). So, total for each k: (n! / (k! k! m!)) * 2^m. Then, sum over k from 0 to floor(n/2).So, F(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} [n! / (k! k! (n - 2k)!))] * 2^{n - 2k}.Hmm, but we need to show that this sum equals (2n choose n). Is that true? Let me test for small n.For n=1: F(1) should be the number of paths of length 1 starting at (0,0) and ending on y=0. But after 1 step, to end on y=0, the step must be either E or W. So, there are 2 paths. But (2*1 choose 1) = 2, which matches. For n=2: Possible paths ending on y=0. Either two horizontal steps (EE, EW, WE, WW) but wait, but the steps can be any combination of N, S, E, W, as long as the number of N equals S. So, for n=2, possible cases:- 0 N, 0 S, 2 E/W: The number of such paths is multinomial coefficient: 2!/(0!0!2!) * 2^2 = 1 * 4 = 4.- 1 N, 1 S, 0 E/W: The number of such paths is multinomial coefficient: 2!/(1!1!0!) * 2^0 = 2 * 1 = 2.Total F(2) = 4 + 2 = 6. And (2*2 choose 2) = 6. Correct.For n=3: Let&#39;s compute F(3). Possible k (number of N/S pairs) can be 0 or 1 (since 2*1=2 &lt;=3, but 2*2=4&gt;3). Case k=0: All 3 steps are E/W. Number of paths: multinomial coefficient 3!/(0!0!3!) * 2^3 = 1 * 8 = 8.Case k=1: 1 N, 1 S, 1 E/W. Number of paths: multinomial coefficient 3!/(1!1!1!) * 2^1 = 6 * 2 = 12.Total F(3) = 8 + 12 = 20. But (2*3 choose 3) = 20. Correct.So the formula seems to hold for n=1,2,3. So maybe the sum expression is equal to (2n choose n). But how to prove it?Alternatively, think of generating functions. Let me consider the generating function for F(n). Each step can be N, S, E, W. To end at y=0, the number of N and S steps must be equal. For the x-coordinate, each E contributes +1, W contributes -1, so the total displacement in x is (E - W). But we don&#39;t care about the x displacement, only that y=0. So, the generating function would consider the weight for y=0, regardless of x. Let me model this. Let’s think of each step as contributing a term in the generating function. For the y-coordinate, N is +1, S is -1, E and W are 0. So, for the generating function tracking the y-coordinate, the steps N and S contribute t and t^{-1}, while E and W contribute 1. So, the generating function for one step is t + t^{-1} + 2 (since E and W each contribute 1 for the x direction, but since we aren&#39;t tracking x, it&#39;s just 2). Wait, but if we are only tracking the y-coordinate, then each step contributes t + t^{-1} + 2. Then, the generating function for n steps is (t + t^{-1} + 2)^n. Then, the coefficient of t^0 in this expansion would give the number of paths that end at y=0, which is exactly F(n). So, F(n) = [t^0] (t + t^{-1} + 2)^n.But we need to compute this coefficient. Let&#39;s see. Let me write the generating function as (t + 2 + 1/t)^n. Let’s make substitution: let t + 1/t = z. Then, t + 1/t + 2 = z + 2. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, factor:(t + 1/t + 2) = (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^2. Wait, (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^2 = t + 2 + 1/t. So, t + 1/t + 2 = (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^2. Therefore, (t + 1/t + 2)^n = (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^{2n}. Therefore, F(n) = [t^0] (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^{2n}. But expanding (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^{2n} is the same as expanding (a + b)^{2n} where a = sqrt(t) and b = 1/sqrt(t). The general term in the expansion is C(2n, k) a^{k} b^{2n - k} = C(2n, k) t^{(k - (2n - k))/2} = C(2n, k) t^{(2k - 2n)/2} = C(2n, k) t^{k - n}. So, the coefficient of t^0 is when k - n = 0, i.e., k = n. Therefore, the coefficient is C(2n, n). Hence, F(n) = C(2n, n). So, that&#39;s a generating function proof. But maybe there&#39;s a more combinatorial way? Let me think.Alternatively, consider that each path ending on y=0 corresponds to a walk where the number of N steps equals the number of S steps. Suppose we have k pairs of N and S steps. Then, the remaining steps are E and W. But how does this relate to (2n choose n)?Wait, another idea: if we consider that for each step, we have two options that affect y-coordinate (N and S) and two that don&#39;t (E and W). But perhaps we can map these paths to another problem where we have only two choices each step, but weighted.Alternatively, think of reflecting the path in some way. But maybe the generating function approach is the simplest.Wait, let&#39;s see again: the generating function is (t + 1/t + 2)^n, and we want the constant term. But when we rewrite this as (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^{2n}, then the constant term is indeed the central binomial coefficient. That&#39;s a neat trick. So, the key idea is to recognize that the generating function can be rewritten in a form that allows us to use the central binomial coefficient.Alternatively, think of encoding the steps as moves that can be paired. For example, each N must be paired with an S, and the E and W are neutral. But this seems vague. Alternatively, using the reflection principle. But since the problem allows any x-coordinate, reflection might be tricky.Wait, perhaps using the fact that (2n choose n) counts the number of balanced sequences with n left and n right steps, but in our case, we have steps in four directions. However, in the generating function approach, by substituting variables, we transformed the problem into a one-dimensional walk with steps that can be up or down, scaled appropriately.Alternatively, think of the problem as a combination of two independent walks: one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The y-direction walk must return to 0 after n steps, while the x-direction walk can be anything. Then, the total number of paths is the number of y-walks returning to 0 multiplied by the number of x-walks (which is 2^n, since each step can be E or W). Wait, but that would be incorrect because the steps aren&#39;t independent. Each step is either N, S, E, or W, so the x and y steps are not independent; each step affects either x or y, but not both. So, actually, the movement in x and y are dependent. For example, each step is either a vertical move (N/S) or a horizontal move (E/W). Therefore, the total number of steps that are vertical is 2k (k N and k S), and the remaining n - 2k are horizontal. So, the number of such paths is sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} (number of ways to choose 2k vertical steps and n - 2k horizontal steps) * (number of vertical paths returning to 0) * (number of horizontal paths). The number of ways to choose the vertical steps is C(n, 2k). Then, for the vertical paths returning to 0 in 2k steps: that&#39;s the number of Dyck paths of length 2k, which is C(2k, k). Then, for the horizontal steps: each of the n - 2k steps can be either E or W, so 2^{n - 2k}. Therefore, F(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2k) * C(2k, k) * 2^{n - 2k}.But this sum is supposed to equal C(2n, n). Hmm, how to show that? Maybe using generating functions again. Let’s see:The sum sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2k) * C(2k, k) * 2^{n - 2k} can be considered as follows. C(n, 2k) * C(2k, k) is the number of ways to choose 2k steps out of n to be vertical, then arrange them as k N and k S. Then, the remaining n - 2k steps are horizontal, each with 2 choices. Alternatively, think of generating functions for the vertical and horizontal steps. The generating function for vertical steps is sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k, k) x^{2k} } = sum_{k=0}^infty frac{(2k)!}{(k!)^2} x^{2k} } = frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}}}. And the generating function for horizontal steps is sum_{m=0}^infty 2^m x^m } = frac{1}{1 - 2x}.Therefore, the generating function for F(n) is the product of these two: frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} * frac{1}{1 - 2x}. But we need to find the coefficient of x^n in this product. Alternatively, note that:frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} * frac{1}{1 - 2x} = frac{1}{(1 - 2x) sqrt{1 - 4x^2}}.But maybe this isn&#39;t helpful. Wait, let&#39;s compute the generating function in another way. Alternatively, note that the generating function for F(n) is (sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k, k) x^{2k}) ) * (sum_{m=0}^infty 2^m x^m} ). So, the product is sum_{n=0}^infty (sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(2k, k) * 2^{n - 2k}) ) x^n. But according to the generating function approach earlier, F(n) is also the central binomial coefficient, whose generating function is sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n, n) x^n} = frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x}}. But our product generating function is frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} * frac{1}{1 - 2x}. Let&#39;s see if this equals frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x}}.Compute:frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} * frac{1}{1 - 2x} = frac{1}{(1 - 2x) sqrt{1 - 4x^2}}}.Let me check if this equals 1/sqrt(1 - 4x):Let’s square both sides:Left side: 1 / ( (1 - 2x)^2 (1 - 4x^2) )Right side: 1 / (1 - 4x)So, equate:1 / ( (1 - 2x)^2 (1 - 4x^2) ) = 1 / (1 - 4x)Multiply both sides by denominators:1 - 4x = (1 - 2x)^2 (1 - 4x^2)Expand the right-hand side:(1 - 4x + 4x^2)(1 - 4x^2) = 1*(1 - 4x^2) -4x*(1 - 4x^2) +4x^2*(1 - 4x^2)= 1 - 4x^2 -4x + 16x^3 +4x^2 - 16x^4Simplify:1 -4x + ( -4x^2 +4x^2 ) +16x^3 -16x^4=1 -4x +16x^3 -16x^4Compare with left-hand side 1 -4x. Clearly not equal. So, the generating functions are different. Therefore, the product generating function is not equal to the generating function of the central binomial coefficients. Therefore, my earlier approach must have a mistake.Wait, but earlier in the generating function substitution, I transformed the original generating function into the central binomial coefficient. So, maybe there are two different expressions here, but they must be equivalent. Let me see.Wait, in the first generating function approach, we considered the generating function for F(n) as [t^0] (t + 1/t + 2)^n, which led us to (sqrt(t) + 1/sqrt(t))^{2n}, hence the central binomial coefficient. So, that seems correct.But when breaking down into vertical and horizontal steps, we get a different expression. So, perhaps these two expressions are equivalent? Let me check for n=1,2,3.For n=1: sum_{k=0}^0 C(1,0) C(0,0) 2^{1} = 1*1*2 = 2, which equals (2*1 choose 1)=2.For n=2: sum_{k=0}^1 C(2,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{2-2k}. For k=0: C(2,0)=1, C(0,0)=1, 2^2=4. For k=1: C(2,2)=1, C(2,1)=2, 2^{0}=1. So total F(2)=4 + 2=6, which equals (4 choose 2)=6.For n=3: sum_{k=0}^1 C(3,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{3-2k}. For k=0: C(3,0)=1, C(0,0)=1, 2^3=8. For k=1: C(3,2)=3, C(2,1)=2, 2^{1}=2. So total F(3)=8 + 3*2*2=8 +12=20, which equals (6 choose 3)=20. So the sum expression is correct.But the generating functions, the product generating function and the central binomial coefficient generating function, both give the same coefficients for n=1,2,3, even though the generating functions themselves are different? Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, no, actually, when we consider the generating function for F(n) as a product of vertical and horizontal generating functions, it&#39;s different from the central binomial coefficient generating function, but for each n, the coefficients match. So perhaps the generating functions are different but their coefficients for x^n are the same. That is, the two generating functions are different as functions, but their expansions have the same coefficients up to all orders. But how?Wait, that&#39;s impossible. If two generating functions are different, their coefficients must differ at some n. But in our case, for n=1,2,3, the coefficients match. Let me check for n=4.Compute F(4) via the sum:sum_{k=0}^2 C(4,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{4-2k}k=0: C(4,0)=1, C(0,0)=1, 2^4=16k=1: C(4,2)=6, C(2,1)=2, 2^{2}=4, so 6*2*4=48k=2: C(4,4)=1, C(4,2)=6, 2^0=1, so 1*6*1=6Total F(4)=16 +48 +6=70Meanwhile, (8 choose 4)=70. Correct.The central binomial coefficient generating function is 1/sqrt(1 - 4x) = sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n, n) x^n. Let me compute its coefficients:For n=0: 1n=1: 2n=2: 6n=3: 20n=4: 70Which matches. So, even though the generating functions looked different, the product generating function must actually be equal to 1/sqrt(1 -4x). Let&#39;s check:The product GF is 1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 -4x^2) )Let me see if this is equal to 1/sqrt(1 -4x):Compute 1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 -4x^2) ) compared to 1/sqrt(1 -4x).Cross-multiplying:sqrt(1 -4x) / ( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 -4x^2) ) = sqrt( (1 -4x) / ( (1 - 2x)^2 (1 -4x^2) ) )Simplify inside the square root:(1 -4x) / ( (1 -2x)^2 (1 -4x^2) ) = (1 -4x) / ( (1 -2x)^2 (1 -2x)(1 +2x) )) = (1 -4x) / ( (1 -2x)^3 (1 +2x) )Hmm, this seems messy. Let me plug in x = 0.1:Left-hand side GF: 1/( (1 - 0.2) sqrt(1 -0.04) ) ≈ 1/(0.8 * 0.9798) ≈1.281Right-hand side GF: 1/sqrt(1 -0.4) ≈1/sqrt(0.6)≈1.291They are not equal. So, the generating functions are different, but their coefficients agree up to n=4? Wait, but when I computed F(4), both the sum and the central binomial coefficient give 70, which matches. Wait, maybe they are equal for all n? How?Wait, perhaps the product generating function is equal to the central binomial coefficient generating function. Let me manipulate:Let’s compute 1/( (1 -2x) sqrt(1 -4x^2) )Note that sqrt(1 -4x^2) = sqrt( (1 -2x)(1 +2x) )Therefore, 1/( (1 -2x) sqrt( (1 -2x)(1 +2x) )) = 1/( (1 -2x)^{3/2} (1 +2x)^{1/2} )= (1 -2x)^{-3/2} (1 +2x)^{-1/2}But the central binomial coefficient generating function is (1 -4x)^{-1/2} = ( (1 -2x)(1 +2x) )^{-1/2} = (1 -2x)^{-1/2} (1 +2x)^{-1/2}Therefore, the two generating functions differ by a factor of (1 -2x)^{-1}.So, our product generating function is (1 -2x)^{-1} times the central binomial GF. Therefore, the coefficients of the product GF would be the convolution of the central binomial coefficients and the coefficients of (1 -2x)^{-1}, which is 2^n. Therefore, this suggests that F(n) = sum_{k=0}^n C(2k, k) 2^{n -k} }, but in reality, our sum is sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2k) C(2k, k) 2^{n -2k} }, which is different. So, perhaps there is a combinatorial identity here that equates these two sums?Wait, but for n=4, our sum is 70, and sum_{k=0}^4 C(2k,k) 2^{4 -k} } would be C(0,0)*16 + C(2,1)*8 + C(4,2)*4 + C(6,3)*2 + C(8,4)*1 = 1*16 + 2*8 + 6*4 + 20*2 + 70*1 =16+16+24+40+70=166, which is not 70. So, different. Therefore, the two generating functions are indeed different, but somehow for the cases we checked, the coefficients agree. But wait, no, in our previous calculation, we saw that for n=4, F(n)=70 which is equal to (8 choose 4)=70. But according to the generating function product, the coefficient of x^4 should be sum_{k=0}^4 C(2k,k)*2^{4 -k} } which is 166 as above. So, this contradicts. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.Wait, wait, no, actually in our problem, F(n) is sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{n -2k} }, which for n=4, gives 70, as computed. But the generating function of this sum is different from the central binomial coefficient generating function, but when you compute F(n), it equals the central binomial coefficient. So, how is this possible?Wait, perhaps there is a generating function identity that shows that sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{n -2k} } = C(2n,n). Alternatively, perhaps using the generating function approach from the first method where we recognized that the generating function is (sqrt(t) +1/sqrt(t))^{2n} evaluated at t^0, giving C(2n,n). So, that&#39;s a valid approach because when we consider the original steps as N, S, E, W, the generating function in terms of y-displacement is as before.But how does this reconcile with the vertical/horizontal decomposition?Wait, perhaps the key insight is that when you have steps that can affect two different coordinates, but the condition is on one coordinate, you can use generating functions that track the necessary condition (here, y=0) and sum over the other coordinate.Alternatively, think of the problem as equivalent to a walk in the plane where we want the number of walks of length n that start at (0,0) and end on the x-axis. But steps are in four directions. This is equivalent to a walk on the two-dimensional lattice with four neighbors, returning to the x-axis after n steps.Alternatively, think of this as a 1-dimensional walk with a &quot;color&quot; or &quot;state&quot; that can be in x or y direction. But this seems complicated.Wait, here&#39;s another idea: Let&#39;s consider that each step is either horizontal (E/W) or vertical (N/S). For the path to end on y=0, the number of vertical steps must be even: 2k, with k N and k S. The number of such paths is C(n,2k) * C(2k,k) * 2^{n -2k} * 2^{n -2k} }? Wait, no. Wait, for vertical steps: choosing 2k steps out of n to be vertical, then among those 2k steps, k are N and k are S. The number of ways is C(n,2k) * C(2k,k). Then, the remaining n - 2k steps are horizontal, each can be E or W, so 2^{n -2k} choices. So total per k: C(n,2k)*C(2k,k)*2^{n -2k}. Then sum over k. Which is the same expression as before.So, F(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{n -2k}But how does this sum equal C(2n,n)? Let&#39;s see for n=2:sum_{k=0}^1 C(2,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{2 -2k} = C(2,0)C(0,0)2^2 + C(2,2)C(2,1)2^0 = 1*1*4 +1*2*1=4 +2=6=C(4,2)=6.For n=3:sum_{k=0}^1 C(3,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{3-2k} = C(3,0)C(0,0)2^3 + C(3,2)C(2,1)2^{1}=1*1*8 +3*2*2=8+12=20=C(6,3)=20.Similarly, for n=4, sum gives 70=C(8,4). So, seems identity holds.But how to prove it? Perhaps using generating functions:Let’s consider the generating function for F(n):G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty F(n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{n -2k}] x^nWe need to show that G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n,n) x^n = 1/sqrt(1 -4x).Let’s compute G(x):G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n,2k) C(2k,k) 2^{n -2k}] x^nSwitch the order of summation:G(x) = sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) 2^{-2k} sum_{n=2k}^infty C(n,2k) (2x)^nBecause 2^{n -2k} = 2^n / 2^{2k}, so we can write:= sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) 2^{-2k} sum_{n=2k}^infty C(n,2k) (2x)^nThe inner sum is sum_{n=2k}^infty C(n,2k) (2x)^n = (2x)^{2k} sum_{m=0}^infty C(2k +m, 2k) (2x)^mWhere we set m = n -2k. Then,= (2x)^{2k} sum_{m=0}^infty C(2k +m, m) (2x)^m= (2x)^{2k} / (1 -2x)^{2k +1}Because sum_{m=0}^infty C(m + r, r) x^m = 1/(1 -x)^{r +1}Thus,G(x) = sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) 2^{-2k} * (2x)^{2k} / (1 -2x)^{2k +1}= sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) ( (2x)^2 / (2^{2k} (1 -2x)^{2k +1}) ) Wait, substituting:C(2k,k) * 2^{-2k} * (2x)^{2k} / (1 -2x)^{2k +1} = C(2k,k) * ( (4x^2)/ (4^k) ) / (1 -2x)^{2k +1} )= C(2k,k) * (x^2)^k / ( (1 -2x)^{2k +1} )Thus,G(x) = sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) (x^2)^k / (1 -2x)^{2k +1}Factor out 1/(1 -2x):G(x) = 1/(1 -2x) sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) (x^2 / (1 -2x)^2 )^kThe sum is sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) z^k where z = x^2 / (1 -2x)^2.We know that sum_{k=0}^infty C(2k,k) z^k = 1/sqrt(1 -4z}Therefore,G(x) = 1/(1 -2x) * 1 / sqrt(1 -4 * x^2 / (1 -2x)^2 )Simplify the expression inside the sqrt:1 -4x^2/(1 -2x)^2 = [ (1 -2x)^2 -4x^2 ] / (1 -2x)^2 = [1 -4x +4x^2 -4x^2]/(1 -2x)^2 = (1 -4x)/ (1 -2x)^2Therefore,G(x) = 1/(1 -2x) * 1 / sqrt( (1 -4x)/ (1 -2x)^2 )=1/(1 -2x) * (1 -2x)/sqrt(1 -4x)=1/sqrt(1 -4x)Which is the generating function for the central binomial coefficients. Hence, G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n,n) x^n, so F(n) = C(2n,n). Hence, proved.Wow, that was a bit involved, but it checks out. So, the key steps were:1. Express F(n) as a sum over k of the number of paths with k vertical pairs and the rest horizontal steps.2. Formulate the generating function G(x) for F(n).3. By switching the order of summation and using generating function techniques, simplify G(x) to 1/sqrt(1 -4x), which is the generating function for C(2n,n).4. Conclude that F(n) = C(2n,n).Another way is using the generating function approach where we recognize that the original problem can be transformed into a central binomial coefficient scenario by substituting variables, as in the first approach. Either way, the result follows.So, the answer is that F(n) is indeed equal to the central binomial coefficient, which is (2n choose n).Final AnswerThe number of distinct paths is boxed{dbinom{2n}{n}}.&lt;/think&gt;To prove that ( F(n) = binom{2n}{n} ), we start by considering the problem of counting the number of distinct paths starting at ((0,0)) and ending on the line ( y = 0 ) after ( n ) steps. Each step can be either North, South, East, or West.1. Key Insight: For a path to end on ( y = 0 ), the number of North (N) steps must equal the number of South (S) steps. Let ( k ) be the number of such pairs (N, S). The remaining ( n - 2k ) steps are either East (E) or West (W).2. Combinatorial Counting: For each ( k ), the number of ways to choose the positions of the N and S steps is given by the multinomial coefficient ( binom{n}{2k} ). The number of ways to arrange ( k ) N steps and ( k ) S steps is ( binom{2k}{k} ). The remaining ( n - 2k ) steps (E or W) can be chosen in ( 2^{n - 2k} ) ways. Thus, the number of paths for each ( k ) is ( binom{n}{2k} binom{2k}{k} 2^{n - 2k} ).3. Summing Over All ( k ): Summing over all possible ( k ) gives:   [   F(n) = sum_{k=0}^{lfloor n/2 rfloor} binom{n}{2k} binom{2k}{k} 2^{n - 2k}   ]4. Generating Function Approach: We use generating functions to simplify the sum. The generating function for vertical steps (N and S) is ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} binom{2k}{k} x^{2k} = frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} ). The generating function for horizontal steps (E and W) is ( sum_{m=0}^{infty} 2^m x^m = frac{1}{1 - 2x} ).5. Combining Generating Functions: The product of these generating functions is:   [   frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x^2}} cdot frac{1}{1 - 2x}   ]   Simplifying this product using algebraic manipulation and substitution shows it equals ( frac{1}{sqrt{1 - 4x}} ), which is the generating function for the central binomial coefficient ( binom{2n}{n} ).6. Conclusion: Since the generating function for ( F(n) ) matches the generating function for ( binom{2n}{n} ), we conclude that ( F(n) = binom{2n}{n} ).Thus, the number of distinct paths is (boxed{dbinom{2n}{n}}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to prove that the number of distinct paths starting at (0,0) and ending on the line y=0 after n steps is equal to the binomial coefficient (2n choose n). Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A path here is a sequence of lattice points where each consecutive pair is one unit apart. So each step can be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. But since we start at (0,0) and after n steps we need to end on y=0, that means the path can move around, but the final y-coordinate must be 0. Wait, but how does that work? If each step is of length 1, then each move changes either the x or y coordinate by 1, right? So each step is like moving either horizontally or vertically. So, for example, moving right would be (x+1, y), left (x-1, y), up (x, y+1), or down (x, y-1). Now, starting at (0,0), after n steps, the path ends on the x-axis (y=0). The number of such paths is F(n), and the claim is that F(n) is equal to the central binomial coefficient, (2n choose n). That&#39;s the number of ways to choose n items out of 2n, which also counts things like the number of Dyck paths or the number of ways to arrange parentheses correctly, but here it&#39;s about lattice paths returning to the x-axis. Wait, but in the classic case, the number of paths that return to the origin after 2n steps when you can only move up/down or left/right is different. Wait, no, actually, if you consider only moving in two directions, say east and west, then the number of paths returning to the origin after 2n steps is (2n choose n). But here, the problem allows movement in four directions. So how does that affect the count?Wait, hold on. If we can move in four directions, each step has four choices. But we need to end on y=0. So the total number of paths of length n starting at (0,0) is 4^n. But F(n) is the number of those paths that end on y=0. So perhaps we can model this as a combinatorial problem where we have to balance the number of up and down steps? But in addition, left and right steps don&#39;t affect the y-coordinate. So let me think. Let&#39;s denote the steps as follows:- U: (0,1)- D: (0,-1)- R: (1,0)- L: (-1,0)Each step is one of U, D, L, R. To end up at y=0, the number of U steps must equal the number of D steps. Because each U increases y by 1, each D decreases y by 1. So if we have k U steps, we need k D steps. Then the remaining n - 2k steps must be either L or R, which don&#39;t affect the y-coordinate. Therefore, for each k from 0 to floor(n/2), the number of paths with exactly k U steps, k D steps, and (n - 2k) horizontal steps (L or R). Then the total number F(n) would be the sum over all k of [ (number of ways to choose positions for U, D, and horizontal steps) multiplied by (number of ways to choose horizontal steps) ].Let&#39;s formalize this. For a given k, the number of ways to arrange k U&#39;s, k D&#39;s, and (n - 2k) horizontal steps (H) is the multinomial coefficient:(n choose k, k, n - 2k) = n! / (k! k! (n - 2k)! )And for the horizontal steps, each can be either L or R, so for each of the (n - 2k) horizontal steps, there are 2 choices. Therefore, the total number of paths for each k is:[ n! / (k! k! (n - 2k)! ) ] * 2^{n - 2k}Therefore, F(n) = sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} [ n! / (k! k! (n - 2k)! ) ] * 2^{n - 2k}But the problem states that F(n) = binomial(2n, n). So we need to show that this sum equals (2n choose n). Hmm, that seems non-trivial. How can we show that?Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a generating function approach. Let me think. The generating function for the number of U and D steps that cancel out would involve terms like (x + y + z + w)^n, but with constraints on the exponents. Maybe not straightforward.Wait, another approach: reflection principle? But the reflection principle is usually used for paths that stay above a certain line or return to the origin, but in the case of one dimension. Maybe we can model the y-coordinate as a symmetric simple random walk, and the x-coordinate as another independent walk? Because the steps in x and y directions are independent. But since the problem allows moving in any of the four directions, each step can affect either x or y. So the movement in the x and y directions are dependent. For example, if you move right, the x-coordinate increases by 1 and y stays the same. If you move up, y increases by 1 and x stays the same, etc. So actually, each step is either a horizontal move (left or right) or a vertical move (up or down). So each step has two choices for direction in x or y. Wait, but in the problem statement, is each step exactly one unit in one of the four directions? So each step is either horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal. So each step has four possibilities: left, right, up, down. So each step is in one of the four cardinal directions. So in effect, the walk is on the 2D lattice, with steps in four directions. Then, the x and y coordinates are each simple symmetric random walks, but only one of them changes at each step. So they are not independent because at each step, you decide whether to move in x or y direction.Wait, but maybe we can think of this as two independent processes: the choice of direction (x or y) and then the choice of sign (left/right or up/down). For each step, first, you decide whether to move in the x or y direction (2 choices), and then you choose the direction (left/right or up/down, each with 2 choices). So total 2*2=4 choices per step. Therefore, the number of paths is 4^n. But we need the number of paths that end at y=0, regardless of the x-coordinate. So, to model this, perhaps we can think of each step as either affecting the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate. For steps affecting the x-coordinate, they can be left or right; for steps affecting y-coordinate, up or down. But since the total number of steps is n, we can separate the steps into those that are horizontal (left/right) and vertical (up/down). Let me denote the number of vertical steps as k, then the number of horizontal steps is n - k. For the path to end at y=0, the number of up steps must equal the number of down steps. So if there are k vertical steps, we must have k even, and the number of up steps is k/2, and down steps is k/2. Wait, actually, if there are k vertical steps, to return to y=0, the number of up steps must equal the number of down steps, so k must be even. Let k = 2m, then the number of ways to choose the vertical steps is C(k, m) = C(2m, m). Then, the horizontal steps can be any combination of left and right steps, which is 2^{n - k} possibilities. But how does this fit into the total count? So first, choose how many vertical steps there are (k), which must be even. Then, for each k = 2m, the number of paths is C(n, k) * C(k, m) * 2^{n - k}. Here, C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose which steps are vertical, then C(k, m) is the number of ways to choose how many up and down steps (since they must be equal), and 2^{n - k} is the number of ways to choose left and right steps. Therefore, the total number of paths is sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m}But the problem states that this sum equals C(2n, n). So we need to prove that sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m} = C(2n, n)Hmm, this seems like a combinatorial identity. Maybe we can find a generating function for both sides and show they are equal.Let me compute the generating function for F(n). Let&#39;s denote the generating function as G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty F(n) x^nBut F(n) is the number of paths of length n ending on y=0. Each step can be in four directions. Alternatively, since we need to end on y=0, maybe we can model the generating function by considering the generating function for the y-coordinate and the x-coordinate separately.Wait, but the movement in x and y are dependent since each step is either horizontal or vertical. So they are not independent. Hmm, perhaps not straightforward.Alternatively, note that the problem resembles a 2-dimensional walk where we want the projection onto the y-axis to return to 0 after n steps. But steps can only affect one coordinate at a time.Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of generating functions in two variables. Let me consider the generating function where we track both the x and y displacements. But since we only care about the y=0 at the end, perhaps we can set y=0 in the generating function.Alternatively, think of the generating function for the y-coordinate. For each step, when you move vertically, it contributes a factor of (z + z^{-1}), where z tracks the y-coordinate. When you move horizontally, it doesn&#39;t affect y, so it contributes a factor of 2 (since left and right steps don&#39;t affect y). Similarly, the x-coordinate&#39;s generating function would involve steps that are (w + w^{-1}) for vertical moves and 2 for horizontal moves. But since we only need the total number of paths ending at y=0, regardless of x, perhaps we can set z=1 (to ignore the x-coordinate) and look for the constant term in z?Wait, this might be getting too complicated. Let me think of another approach.Suppose we consider that each step is either horizontal or vertical. For each step, with probability 1/2, it&#39;s horizontal (left or right), and with probability 1/2, it&#39;s vertical (up or down). But actually, the exact probabilities might not matter here; we just need the count.Wait, but in terms of generating functions, perhaps the generating function for vertical steps is ( (z + z^{-1}) )^k, and horizontal steps is (2)^{n - k}. But we need the coefficient of z^0 in the product, summed over all k.Wait, let&#39;s see. The total generating function would be sum_{n=0}^infty F(n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) * [coefficient of z^0 in (z + z^{-1})^k] * 2^{n - k}] x^nBecause for each path of length n, we choose k steps to be vertical, which contribute (z + z^{-1})^k, and the remaining n - k steps are horizontal, contributing 2^{n - k} (since each horizontal step can be left or right). Then, the coefficient of z^0 in (z + z^{-1})^k is the number of ways to have equal numbers of up and down steps, which is C(k, k/2) if k is even, else 0. Therefore, F(n) = sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m}So the generating function G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m}] x^nBut we need to show that this generating function is equal to sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n, n) x^nBecause the right-hand side is the generating function for the central binomial coefficients, which is 1/sqrt(1 - 4x). Wait, actually, the generating function for C(2n, n) is sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n, n) x^n = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)So if we can show that G(x) = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x), then it would follow that F(n) = C(2n, n)Alternatively, compute G(x):G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m}] x^nLet me try to switch the order of summation:G(x) = sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) 2^{-2m} sum_{n=2m}^infty C(n, 2m) (2x)^nWait, not sure. Alternatively, note that for each m, the term C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m} C(n, 2m) can be thought of as first choosing 2m positions out of n, then arranging the vertical steps (with C(2m, m) ways) and the horizontal steps (2^{n - 2m} ways). So the generating function would be:sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) (x^2)^m * sum_{k=0}^infty 2^{k} x^k } where k = n - 2m. Because n = 2m + k, so:G(x) = [sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) (x^2)^m] * [sum_{k=0}^infty (2x)^k] The second sum is a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^infty (2x)^k = 1/(1 - 2x) for |x| &lt; 1/2The first sum is sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) x^{2m} = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)} Because the generating function for the central binomial coefficients is 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}. Wait, if we let z = x^2, then sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) z^m = 1/sqrt(1 - 4z)}, so substituting z = x^2, we get sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) x^{2m} = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)}Therefore, G(x) = [1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)} ] * [1/(1 - 2x)} ] But we need to compute this product:G(x) = 1 / [ (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 - 4x^2) ) ]Hmm, but this doesn&#39;t seem to simplify to 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}. So perhaps my approach is wrong.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Let me check again.Wait, the original generating function:G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty F(n) x^n = sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m}] x^nBut when I switch the order of summation:For each m, sum over n &gt;= 2m:G(x) = sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) 2^{-2m} sum_{n=2m}^infty C(n, 2m) (2x)^nWait, this might not be the right way. Alternatively, consider that for each vertical step pair (up and down), we have a certain structure.Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as a product of two independent walks: one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. But since each step is either x or y, they aren&#39;t independent. However, maybe we can use generating functions where each step is either x or y. Wait, another idea: if we ignore the x-coordinate entirely, the problem reduces to counting walks on the y-axis that return to 0 after n steps, with each step being +1, -1, or staying put (since horizontal steps don&#39;t affect y). But no, in this problem, each step must be either horizontal or vertical. So there&#39;s no staying put; every step changes either x or y by 1. So, the walk on the y-axis is a sequence of steps where each step is either +1, -1, or a &quot;pause&quot; (i.e., a horizontal step which doesn&#39;t change y). But in our case, there are no pauses; each step is either changing x or y. So in the y-axis, it&#39;s a walk where at each step, with probability 1/2, you move +1 or -1, and with probability 1/2, you stay put. But no, in our problem, exactly half of the steps might be vertical? Wait, no. The total number of vertical steps can vary.Wait, perhaps not. Let me re-express the problem. Each step is either horizontal (left/right) or vertical (up/down). The choice is made at each step. So, over n steps, some number k of them are vertical, and n - k are horizontal. For each vertical step, it&#39;s either up or down, and for horizontal, left or right. To end at y=0, the number of up steps must equal the number of down steps. So for each k (number of vertical steps), which must be even, say k = 2m, the number of such paths is C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m}Then, F(n) = sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m}But how to show that this sum equals C(2n, n)?Alternatively, consider that C(2n, n) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (n, n) moving only right and up. Wait, no. Alternatively, in a 1D walk, the number of paths returning to the origin after 2n steps is C(2n, n). But here, it&#39;s a 2D walk with more possibilities. Wait, maybe a bijection exists between these paths and some other structure counted by C(2n, n). For instance, if we can map each path of length n ending on y=0 to a Dyck path or a balanced parenthesis expression, but I don&#39;t see an immediate connection.Alternatively, consider that each step can be encoded as two bits: one bit decides whether it&#39;s horizontal or vertical, and the other bit decides the direction (left/right or up/down). So each step has 2 choices for axis and 2 choices for direction, totaling 4. If we think of each step as two binary choices, axis (x or y) and direction (positive or negative), then the entire path can be represented as a sequence of n axis choices and n direction choices. But how does that help?Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Suppose we interleave the steps in the x and y directions. For each step, if it&#39;s a horizontal move, record it in a separate &quot;x&quot; sequence, and if it&#39;s a vertical move, record it in a &quot;y&quot; sequence. Then, the total number of paths ending at y=0 is equal to the number of ways to interleave a sequence of x moves (left/right) and a sequence of y moves (up/down) where the number of up and down moves are equal. But this seems similar to the original problem. Alternatively, if we consider all possible interleavings, then for each path, the y component forms a Dyck path (if we consider up and down as +1 and -1) of some length k (even), and the x component forms a free path (left and right) of length n - k. But Dyck paths of length 2m have C(2m, m)/(m + 1) number of paths, but here we don&#39;t require the Dyck path condition (non-negative), we just require that the total number of up and down steps are equal, regardless of order. So the number of such y-paths is C(2m, m). Then, the total number of paths is sum_{m} C(n, 2m) C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m}, as before. But we need to show that this sum is equal to C(2n, n). Maybe using generating functions or combinatorial identities.Alternatively, think of the problem as a 2n-step walk where each step is either in x or y direction. Wait, but the original problem has n steps. Maybe there&#39;s a correspondence between n-step four-directional walks ending at y=0 and 2n-step two-directional walks ending at (something). Alternatively, consider that each step in the x direction can be considered as two steps in a different space. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, encoding the path as a combination of x and y moves. Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Consider that each step is either horizontal or vertical. For the entire path, the number of vertical steps must be even (since up and down cancel out). Let&#39;s denote that the number of vertical steps is 2m, so the number of horizontal steps is n - 2m. Now, the total number of such paths is C(n, 2m) * C(2m, m) * 2^{n - 2m} (choose which steps are vertical, then choose how many ups and downs, then choose lefts and rights). So F(n) is the sum over m of these terms. But how does this sum relate to (2n choose n)? Let&#39;s test for small n.Let’s test n=1: F(1) should be the number of paths of length 1 starting at (0,0) and ending on y=0. Since after one step, to end on y=0, the step must be horizontal (left or right). There are 2 such paths. But (2*1 choose 1) = 2, which matches.n=2: F(2) is the number of paths of length 2 starting at (0,0) and ending on y=0. The possibilities are:- Two horizontal steps: each can be left or right. So 2^2 = 4 paths.- One horizontal and one vertical step: but the vertical steps must be up and down. So choose the order of horizontal and vertical steps: C(2,1)=2. For the vertical steps, one up and one down: 2 possibilities (up then down or down then up). For the horizontal steps, left or right: 2 possibilities. So total for this case: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.Wait, but wait, if one horizontal and one vertical step, the vertical steps must be one up and one down. But in two steps, the vertical steps would have to be one up and one down. So the number is C(2,1) [choose which step is vertical] * 2 [up/down or down/up] * 2^{1} [left or right for the horizontal step]. So 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. Then total F(2) = 4 + 8 = 12. But (2*2 choose 2) = 6. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. So this contradicts the original assertion? Wait, no. Wait, for n=2, the problem states F(n) = (2n choose n) = 6, but according to our calculation, F(2) is 12. So either I made a mistake or the original problem is different.Wait, hold on. The problem says &quot;ending in any point P_n on line y = 0&quot;. So F(n) counts the number of paths of length n starting at (0,0) and ending anywhere on the x-axis. So for n=2, the possible endpoints are (-2,0), (-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) if all steps are horizontal. If there&#39;s one horizontal and one vertical step (which cancels out), then the horizontal displacement can be -1, 0, +1. Wait, no. Wait, each horizontal step is either left or right. So with two horizontal steps, you can end at -2, 0, +2. Wait, no. If you take two horizontal steps: each step is left or right. So possible displacements: (-2,0), (-1,0) [left then right], (0,0) [left and right or right and left], (1,0) [right then left], (2,0). Wait, no: two horizontal steps:Each horizontal step is either L or R. The total displacement is the sum of the steps. So for example, LL: (-2,0), LR: 0, RL: 0, RR: +2. So possible x-displacements: -2, 0, +2. So for two horizontal steps, there are 2^2=4 paths, with displacements -2 (1 path), 0 (2 paths), +2 (1 path).Then, for paths with one horizontal and one vertical step: the vertical steps must be U and D, so they cancel. The horizontal step can be L or R. So the displacement in x is either -1 or +1. So the endpoints are (-1,0) and (1,0). For each such path:First, choose the order of steps: horizontal then vertical, or vertical then horizontal. For each order:- If horizontal first: choose L or R, then U then D or D then U. Wait, no. Wait, the vertical steps must total zero. So if you have one horizontal and one vertical step, but vertical steps are two (up and down). Wait, no: if n=2, and you have one horizontal step and one vertical step, but in two steps. Wait, that would require two vertical steps. Wait, I&#39;m confused.Wait, no. For n=2, the total number of steps is 2. If you want to end at y=0, you need the number of up steps equal to down steps. So possible scenarios:- All steps are horizontal: 0 up and 0 down. Then displacement in y is 0, and displacement in x is the sum of left/right steps.- One up and one down step, and 0 horizontal steps. So two vertical steps: one up and one down. Then displacement in y is 0, and displacement in x is 0.Wait, but in two steps, you can have:- Two horizontal steps: displacement in y=0, x can be -2, 0, +2.- Two vertical steps: one up and one down (in any order), displacement x=0, y=0.- One horizontal and one vertical step: but then the y-coordinate would be +1 or -1, which doesn&#39;t end on y=0. So these paths would not be counted.Therefore, for n=2, the valid paths are:- Two horizontal steps: 4 paths (LL, LR, RL, RR). But wait, LR and RL end at (0,0). So endpoints: LL at (-2,0), LR at (0,0), RL at (0,0), RR at (2,0). So total 4 paths, but two of them end at (0,0). However, the problem counts all paths ending on y=0, regardless of x. So all 4 paths of two horizontal steps (LL, LR, RL, RR) end on y=0. Then, the two vertical steps (UD and DU) also end on y=0. So total F(2) = 4 + 2 = 6, which is equal to (4 choose 2) = 6. So my previous calculation was incorrect because I mistakenly considered one horizontal and one vertical step, which actually don&#39;t end on y=0. Therefore, F(2) = 6, which matches (4 choose 2). So my previous mistake was assuming that a single horizontal and single vertical step would end on y=0, but actually, that&#39;s not the case. The vertical step would leave y=1 or -1. So for n=2, only the paths with two horizontal steps or two vertical steps (balanced) end on y=0. So total number is 4 (from two horizontal) + 2 (from two vertical) = 6, which matches the binomial coefficient. So my earlier calculation was wrong, but the correct count for n=2 is indeed 6.So maybe the formula is correct. Let&#39;s check n=3. For n=3, F(3) should be (6 choose 3) = 20.Possible paths ending on y=0:Case 1: All three steps are horizontal. Each step is L or R. The number of such paths is 2^3 = 8. The x-displacements would be -3, -1, +1, +3. But since we just need the path to end on y=0, all 8 paths are valid.Case 2: Two vertical steps and one horizontal step. However, to end on y=0, the vertical steps must be one up and one down. But with three steps, if we have two vertical steps (one up, one down) and one horizontal step. The horizontal step can be L or R. The number of such paths is C(3,2) [choose which two steps are vertical] * 2 [up/down or down/up] * 2 [L or R]. So C(3,2)=3, 3*2*2=12.Case 3: Three vertical steps. To end on y=0, we need three vertical steps with equal numbers of up and down, but 3 is odd, so this is impossible. So no paths here.Therefore, total F(3) = 8 + 12 = 20, which matches (6 choose 3)=20. Okay, so this seems to hold for n=1,2,3. So maybe the formula is correct. Then, how to prove it in general?Wait, the key insight here is that F(n) counts the number of walks of n steps starting at (0,0), ending anywhere on the x-axis, with each step in one of four directions. The number of such walks is equal to the central binomial coefficient (2n choose n). Alternatively, think of each step as having two components: one affecting x, one affecting y. But each step only affects one coordinate. However, since we need the final y-coordinate to be 0, we can think of this as a combination of movements in x and balanced movements in y.Alternatively, here&#39;s a bijection idea. Suppose we have a path of n steps that ends on y=0. Each such path can be associated with a sequence of moves where some steps are vertical (up/down) and the rest are horizontal (left/right), with the vertical steps forming a balanced parenthesis-like structure. However, connecting this to (2n choose n) is not straightforward.Another idea: use generating functions and show that the generating function for F(n) is indeed the generating function for the central binomial coefficients.We saw earlier that:G(x) = sum_{n=0}^infty F(n) x^n = [1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)} ] * [1/(1 - 2x)} ]But we need to show that this is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}, which is the generating function for C(2n, n).Wait, let&#39;s compute [1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)} ] * [1/(1 - 2x)} ].Let me write 1/(1 - 2x) = sum_{k=0}^infty (2x)^kAnd 1/sqrt(1 - 4x^2)} = sum_{m=0}^infty C(2m, m) x^{2m}Then the product G(x) is the convolution:sum_{n=0}^infty [sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m} } ] x^nBut this is exactly the generating function for F(n). Therefore, G(x) = 1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 - 4x^2) ) )But the generating function for C(2n, n) is 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}. These two expressions are not the same. So my previous approach must be wrong.Wait, but according to the small n examples, F(n) = C(2n, n). So the generating functions must be equal. Therefore, there must be an identity that [1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 - 4x^2) ) ) ] = 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}.Let me check this algebraically.Let’s compute:1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt(1 - 4x^2) ) = 1/( (1 - 2x) sqrt( (1 - 2x)(1 + 2x) )) ) = 1/( (1 - 2x)^{3/2} (1 + 2x)^{1/2} ) )Hmm, but 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)} = 1/( (1 - 4x)^{1/2} )So unless (1 - 2x)^{3/2} (1 + 2x)^{1/2} = (1 - 4x)^{1/2}}, which is not true.For example, expand both sides as power series. Let&#39;s compute for x near 0.Left side: (1 - 2x)^{3/2} (1 + 2x)^{1/2} ≈ [1 - 3x - (3/4)(2x)^2 + ... ] * [1 + x - (1/4)(2x)^2 + ... ] ≈ (1 - 3x - 3x^2) * (1 + x - x^2) ≈ 1 - 3x - 3x^2 + x - 3x^2 - 3x^3 - x^2 + 3x^3 + ... ≈ 1 - 2x - 7x^2 + ...Right side: (1 - 4x)^{1/2} ≈ 1 - 2x - 2x^2 + ...They are not the same. Therefore, there must be an error in my generating function approach.But since F(n) = C(2n, n) for n=1,2,3, and the problem statement says to prove it in general, there must be a different way.Wait, another idea: interpret the problem in terms of the number of ways to interleave two independent walks: one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The walk in the y-direction must return to 0 after n steps, while the walk in the x-direction can be any path. However, since each step is either x or y, the walks are interleaved. But in the y-direction, the number of steps must be even (2m), and the walk must return to 0, which is C(2m, m). The remaining n - 2m steps are in the x-direction, which can be any combination of left/right, so 2^{n - 2m}. The interleaving is accounted for by the C(n, 2m) term. Therefore, F(n) = sum_{m=0}^{floor(n/2)} C(n, 2m) C(2m, m) 2^{n - 2m}But we need to show that this sum is equal to C(2n, n). Let&#39;s consider that C(2n, n) is the coefficient of x^n y^n in (x + y)^{2n}, but maybe that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, think of 2n steps where each step is either x or y direction. Wait, no. Alternatively, note that (2n choose n) is the number of binary strings of length 2n with exactly n ones and n zeros. But how does this relate?Wait, here&#39;s a possible combinatorial interpretation. Suppose we have 2n steps, each labeled as either &quot;horizontal&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot;. But wait, no. Alternatively, think of each of the n steps in the original problem as corresponding to two steps in a new problem. For example, each horizontal move (left/right) could correspond to a step in one direction, and each vertical move (up/down) could correspond to a step in another direction. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use generating functions again, but this time with exponential generating functions. Wait, not sure.Wait, here&#39;s an identity from combinatorial literature: sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) C(2k, k) C(2(n - k), n - k) = C(2n, n)^2. But this is different.Wait, let&#39;s consider the generating function squared:[ sum_{n=0}^infty C(2n, n) x^n ]^2 = 1/(1 - 4x)But the generating function for F(n) is supposed to be 1/sqrt(1 - 4x)}, so [sum F(n) x^n]^2 = 1/(1 - 4x), which implies that F(n) is the convolution of C(2n, n) with itself. But this might not be helpful.Alternatively, think of F(n) as the number of walks on the x-axis with stepsize ±1 or ±2? No, perhaps not.Wait, maybe use a reflection argument in 2D. But I don&#39;t see how.Alternatively, use the fact that the number of walks ending at y=0 is equal to the coefficient of (y^0) in the generating function considering y. The generating function for the y-coordinate is ( (y + 1/y) + 2 )^n, since each step can be up (y), down (1/y), left, or right (which don&#39;t affect y, hence the 2). The coefficient of y^0 in this expansion would give the number of walks ending at y=0. So F(n) = [y^0] ( (y + 1/y) + 2 )^n = [y^0] ( (y + 1/y + 2 )^n )Simplify the expression inside:y + 1/y + 2 = (y + 1/y) + 2 = (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^2 = (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^2Wait, actually, (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^2 = y + 2 + 1/y. So, yes, y + 1/y + 2 = (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^2.Therefore, F(n) = [y^0] ( (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^2 )^n = [y^0] (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^{2n}But (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^{2n} is equal to sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n, k) (sqrt(y))^{2n - 2k} }Wait, expanding (sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(y))^{2n} gives sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n, k) (sqrt(y))^{k} (1/sqrt(y))^{2n -k} } = sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n, k) y^{(k - (2n - k))/2 } = sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n, k) y^{(2k - 2n)/2} = sum_{k=0}^{2n} C(2n, k) y^{k - n}Therefore, the coefficient of y^0 is the term where k = n, which is C(2n, n). Therefore, F(n) = C(2n, n). Thus, the proof is complete.Final AnswerThe number of distinct paths is boxed{binom{2n}{n}}.&lt;/think&gt;To prove that ( F(n) = binom{2n}{n} ), we consider the number of distinct paths starting at ((0,0)) and ending on the line ( y = 0 ) after ( n ) steps. Each step can be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. Key steps:1. Understanding the Path Requirements:   - A path of length ( n ) must end on the line ( y = 0 ).   - To end on ( y = 0 ), the number of up steps must equal the number of down steps.2. Combinatorial Analysis:   - Let ( k ) be the number of up and down steps. Then ( k ) must be even, say ( k = 2m ).   - The remaining ( n - 2m ) steps are horizontal (left or right).   - The number of ways to choose ( 2m ) vertical steps out of ( n ) is ( binom{n}{2m} ).   - The number of ways to arrange ( m ) up steps and ( m ) down steps is ( binom{2m}{m} ).   - The number of ways to choose left or right for the remaining ( n - 2m ) steps is ( 2^{n - 2m} ).3. Summing Over All Possible ( m ):   - The total number of paths is given by:     [     F(n) = sum_{m=0}^{lfloor n/2 rfloor} binom{n}{2m} binom{2m}{m} 2^{n - 2m}     ]4. Generating Function Approach:   - Consider the generating function for the number of paths ending on ( y = 0 ).   - The generating function for the y-coordinate component is ( (y + 1/y + 2)^n ).   - The coefficient of ( y^0 ) in this expansion gives the number of paths ending on ( y = 0 ).5. Simplifying the Generating Function:   - Recognize that ( y + 1/y + 2 = (sqrt{y} + 1/sqrt{y})^2 ).   - The generating function becomes ( (sqrt{y} + 1/sqrt{y})^{2n} ).   - The coefficient of ( y^0 ) in this expansion is ( binom{2n}{n} ).Thus, the number of distinct paths ( F(n) ) is indeed given by the central binomial coefficient:[boxed{binom{2n}{n}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>1. Representation of Moves:   Each move in the path can be represented by a complex number: (1, -1, i, -i). Therefore, every path can be represented by a sequence of (n) numbers ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) where (a_i in {1, -1, i, -i}).2. Condition for Ending on (y = 0):   For the path to end on the line (y = 0), the imaginary parts of the complex numbers must sum to zero. This means there must be an equal number of (i) and (-i) in the sequence.3. Counting the Sequences:   Let (k) be the number of (i) and (-i) in the sequence. Then, there are (k) places for (i) and (k) places for (-i). The remaining (n - 2k) places can be filled with (1) and (-1) in (2^{n-2k}) ways.4. Combinatorial Counting:   The number of ways to choose (k) positions for (i) out of (n) is (binom{n}{k}). Similarly, the number of ways to choose (k) positions for (-i) out of the remaining (n-k) positions is (binom{n-k}{k}). Therefore, the total number of sequences is:   [   sum_{k=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} 2^{n-2k}   ]5. Simplifying the Sum:   We can change the sum to:   [   sum_{k=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} binom{n}{2k} binom{2k}{k} 2^{n-2k}   ]6. Proving the Sum Equals (binom{2n}{n}):   We need to show that:   [   sum_{k=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} binom{n}{2k} binom{2k}{k} 2^{n-2k} = binom{2n}{n}   ]   This can be understood combinatorially by considering the problem of choosing (n) people from (n) girls and (n) boys. Each girl has exactly one boyfriend and each boy has exactly one girlfriend, forming (n) pairs. We can choose (2k) boys and then choose (k) boys from them, taking their girlfriends as well. The remaining (n-2k) people can be chosen in (2^{n-2k}) ways. Summing this from (k=0) to (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) gives us the desired result.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ binom{2n}{n} } )</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-ccc77b65 data-v-22911720><div class="review" data-v-22911720><div class="review-title" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>❓:</span>The graph of the function y=x^{2} (x &gt; 0) has a tangent line at the point (a_{k},a_{k}^{2}) that intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}, where k is a positive integer, and a_{1}=16.

The question is about finding the sum a₁ + a₃ + a₅ where each a_{k+1} is the x-intercept of the tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²). They tell me that a₁ is 16, and I need to compute the sum of the first, third, and fifth terms of this sequence. The answer choices are A through D, with numbers 18, 21, 24, and 30. Let me try to work through this step by step.First, let me recall that the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a point (a, f(a)) is given by y = f(a) + f’(a)(x - a). In this case, the function is f(x) = x², so f’(x) = 2x. Therefore, the tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²) will have the equation y = a_k² + 2a_k(x - a_k). Let me write that down:y = a_k² + 2a_k(x - a_k)Now, this tangent line intersects the x-axis where y = 0. So to find the x-intercept a_{k+1}, we set y = 0 and solve for x:0 = a_k² + 2a_k(x - a_k)Let me solve this equation for x. Expanding the right side:0 = a_k² + 2a_k x - 2a_k²Simplify that:0 = -a_k² + 2a_k xThen, bring the -a_k² to the other side:a_k² = 2a_k xDivide both sides by 2a_k (assuming a_k ≠ 0, which it isn&#39;t since x &gt; 0 and a₁ = 16):x = (a_k²) / (2a_k) = a_k / 2So the x-intercept a_{k+1} is equal to a_k / 2. Wait, that seems straightforward. So each subsequent term is half of the previous term. That means the sequence is a geometric sequence where each term is half the previous one. Starting from a₁ = 16, then a₂ = 8, a₃ = 4, a₄ = 2, a₅ = 1, and so on. Then, the sum a₁ + a₃ + a₅ would be 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. Hmm, that&#39;s answer B. But wait, let me verify this because the answer seems too straightforward, and maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me double-check. The tangent line equation at (a_k, a_k²) is y = a_k² + 2a_k(x - a_k). Setting y = 0 to find x-intercept:0 = a_k² + 2a_k x - 2a_k²0 = -a_k² + 2a_k x2a_k x = a_k²x = a_k² / (2a_k) = a_k / 2. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So each a_{k+1} is indeed half of a_k. So the sequence is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, etc. Therefore, a₁ is 16, a₃ is 4, a₅ is 1. Adding them up: 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. Which is option B. Hmm, but let me check again because maybe the problem says x &gt; 0, so the terms are positive, but if we follow the sequence, each term is half the previous, so there&#39;s no issue here.But wait, let me visualize the graph. The tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) for the parabola y = x². The slope of the tangent line is 2a_k, so the equation is y = 2a_k(x - a_k) + a_k². That simplifies to y = 2a_k x - 2a_k² + a_k² = 2a_k x - a_k². Setting y = 0, 0 = 2a_k x - a_k² =&gt; x = a_k² / (2a_k) = a_k / 2. So yes, the x-intercept is a_k / 2. So each term is indeed half the previous one. Therefore, the sequence is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, etc. So the sum a₁ + a₃ + a₅ is 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. Therefore, the answer is B.Wait, but let me check the answer choices again. The options are A:18, B:21, C:24, D:30. So 21 is B. That seems correct. Hmm, but maybe the problem is a bit trickier? Let me make sure I didn&#39;t misinterpret the problem.Wait, the problem says &quot;the tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²) intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}&quot;. Abscissa means the x-coordinate. So yes, the x-intercept is a_{k+1}. Therefore, my calculation is correct. So starting from a₁=16, then a₂=8, a₃=4, a₄=2, a₅=1. Therefore, a₁ + a₃ + a₅ = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. So the answer is B. That seems right.But maybe there&#39;s a different approach here? Let me think again. Suppose I didn&#39;t recognize the pattern, how would I approach it? For example, maybe if I compute the first few terms manually to verify.Starting with a₁ = 16. Then, the tangent at (16, 256). The slope is 2*16 = 32. The equation of the tangent line is y - 256 = 32(x - 16). To find where this line intersects the x-axis, set y = 0:0 - 256 = 32(x - 16)-256 = 32x - 51232x = -256 + 512 = 256x = 256 / 32 = 8. So a₂ = 8. Correct.Next, tangent at (8, 64). The slope is 16. Equation: y - 64 = 16(x - 8). Set y = 0:-64 = 16(x - 8)x - 8 = -64 /16 = -4x = 8 -4 = 4. So a₃ = 4.Then tangent at (4, 16). Slope 8. Equation: y - 16 = 8(x -4). Set y=0:-16 = 8(x -4)x -4 = -16 /8 = -2x = 4 -2 =2. a₄ =2.Then tangent at (2,4). Slope 4. Equation: y -4=4(x -2). Set y=0:-4 =4(x -2)x -2 = -1x=1. So a₅=1.Thus, a₁=16, a₃=4, a₅=1. Sum is 16+4+1=21. Answer B. So that&#39;s correct.Wait, but why does this happen? Each time, the x-intercept is half the previous x-coordinate. Is that a general result for the tangent to y=x²? Let&#39;s check for a general point (a, a²). The tangent line is y = 2a(x - a) + a² = 2a x -2a² +a²=2a x -a². The x-intercept is when 0=2a x -a², so x =a²/(2a)=a/2. So yes, in general, for any point (a, a²) on y=x², the tangent line intersects the x-axis at a/2. Therefore, this sequence is a geometric sequence with ratio 1/2. So starting at 16, each term is half the prior. Therefore, a₁=16, a₂=8, a₃=4, a₄=2, a₅=1, etc. Therefore, the sum a₁+a₃+a₅ is 16+4+1=21. So answer is B.But just to ensure that there isn&#39;t a trick or a misunderstanding, let me check the problem statement once again:&quot;The graph of the function y=x² (x &gt; 0) has a tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²) that intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}, where k is a positive integer, and a₁=16. Then, the value of a₁ +a₃ +a₅ is (　　).&quot;Yes, so each tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) meets the x-axis at a_{k+1}, and starting from a₁=16. Then compute the sum of a₁, a₃, a₅.Therefore, my calculation is correct, and the answer should be B:21. So I think the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves finding the sum (a_1 + a_3 + a_5) where each (a_{k+1}) is the x-intercept of the tangent line to the graph (y = x^2) at the point ((a_k, a_k^2)). Given (a_1 = 16), we need to determine the subsequent terms and their sum.1. Equation of the Tangent Line:   The tangent line at ((a_k, a_k^2)) has the equation:   [   y = a_k^2 + 2a_k(x - a_k)   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   y = 2a_k x - a_k^2   ]2. Finding the x-intercept:   Setting (y = 0) to find the x-intercept (a_{k+1}):   [   0 = 2a_k x - a_k^2   ]   Solving for (x):   [   x = frac{a_k^2}{2a_k} = frac{a_k}{2}   ]   Thus, (a_{k+1} = frac{a_k}{2}).3. Sequence Calculation:   The sequence is a geometric sequence where each term is half of the previous term:   [   a_1 = 16, quad a_2 = 8, quad a_3 = 4, quad a_4 = 2, quad a_5 = 1   ]4. Sum Calculation:   Summing (a_1), (a_3), and (a_5):   [   a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21   ]Thus, the value of (a_1 + a_3 + a_5) is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. So, the problem is about the graph of the function y = x² for x &gt; 0. At the point (a_k, a_k²), there&#39;s a tangent line, and this tangent line intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}. We start with a_1 = 16, and we need to find the value of a₁ + a₃ + a₅. The options are A:18, B:21, C:24, D:30.First, let me visualize the problem. We have the parabola y = x² in the first quadrant (since x &gt; 0). At each point (a_k, a_k²), we draw the tangent line to the parabola. This tangent line will intersect the x-axis at some point a_{k+1}. So, starting from a₁ = 16, we need to find a₂, then a₃, and so on up to a₅, and sum a₁, a₃, a₅.I need to figure out the relationship between a_k and a_{k+1}. To do that, I should find the equation of the tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) and then find its x-intercept, which is a_{k+1}.Let me recall that the derivative of y = x² is y&#39; = 2x. So, the slope of the tangent line at x = a_k is 2a_k.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) is:y - a_k² = 2a_k(x - a_k)Simplifying this equation:y = 2a_k x - 2a_k² + a_k²y = 2a_k x - a_k²Now, this tangent line intersects the x-axis where y = 0. So, setting y = 0:0 = 2a_k x - a_k²Solving for x:2a_k x = a_k²x = a_k² / (2a_k) = a_k / 2Wait, that seems too straightforward. If the x-intercept of the tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) is a_k / 2, then a_{k+1} = a_k / 2.But if that&#39;s the case, then each term is half of the previous one. So starting from a₁ = 16, a₂ = 8, a₃ = 4, a₄ = 2, a₅ = 1, etc. Then, a₁ + a₃ + a₅ would be 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. Which is option B. But before I jump to conclusions, let me verify my calculations because the answer seems too easy, and the options include 24 and 30 as well. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let&#39;s check the tangent line equation again. At point (a_k, a_k²), derivative is 2a_k, so slope is 2a_k. The equation is y - a_k² = 2a_k(x - a_k). When y=0,0 - a_k² = 2a_k(x - a_k)=&gt; -a_k² = 2a_k x - 2a_k²Bring all terms to one side:2a_k x - 2a_k² + a_k² = 02a_k x - a_k² = 02a_k x = a_k²x = a_k² / (2a_k) = a_k / 2Hmm, that still seems correct. So a_{k+1} = a_k / 2. So the sequence is a geometric sequence with ratio 1/2. Starting from 16: 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, etc. Then, a₁ + a₃ + a₅ is 16 + 4 + 1 = 21, which is answer B.But why does the problem mention &quot;where k is a positive integer&quot;? Maybe there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing here. Let me check the problem statement again.&quot;The graph of the function y = x² (x &gt; 0) has a tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²) that intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}, where k is a positive integer, and a₁ = 16.&quot;So, seems like my initial reasoning is correct. Then why is the answer not B? Wait, but maybe my mistake is in the tangent line equation. Let me check once again.Given point (a, a²) on the parabola y = x². The derivative here is 2a, so the slope is 2a. The tangent line equation is:y = 2a(x - a) + a²Which simplifies to y = 2a x - 2a² + a² = 2a x - a². Correct. Then, when y = 0,0 = 2a x - a² =&gt; x = a² / (2a) = a / 2. So yes, the x-intercept is at (a/2, 0). Therefore, a_{k+1} = a_k / 2.Therefore, each term is half the previous term, so the sequence is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, etc. Then, a₁ = 16, a₂ = 8, a₃ = 4, a₄ = 2, a₅ = 1. Therefore, a₁ + a₃ + a₅ = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. So answer B.But the problem is presented in a Chinese exam or competition? Maybe I need to verify again.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a misunderstanding in the problem. The tangent line at (a_k, a_k²) intersects the x-axis at (a_{k+1}, 0). Therefore, the abscissa (x-coordinate) is a_{k+1}. So, according to the calculation, a_{k+1} = a_k / 2. So, yes, the sequence is 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, etc. Therefore, the sum is 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. The answer is B.But wait, the options given are A:18, B:21, C:24, D:30. So 21 is there. So why is this a problem? Maybe the mistake is in assuming that the tangent line&#39;s x-intercept is a_{k+1} = a_k / 2. Wait, let&#39;s take a specific example. Let me take a_k =16, compute the tangent line at (16, 256). The slope is 32. The tangent line equation: y - 256 = 32(x - 16). When y=0, 0 -256 =32(x -16) =&gt; -256 =32x -512 =&gt; 32x = 256 =&gt; x=8. So a₂=8. Then tangent at (8,64): slope 16. Equation: y -64=16(x-8). When y=0, -64=16x -128 =&gt; 16x=64 =&gt; x=4. So a₃=4. Then tangent at (4,16): slope 8. Equation y-16=8(x-4). When y=0: -16=8x-32 =&gt;8x=16 =&gt;x=2. So a₄=2. Then tangent at (2,4): slope 4. Equation y-4=4(x-2). When y=0: -4=4x-8 =&gt;4x=4 =&gt;x=1. So a₅=1. Therefore, a₁+a₃+a₅=16+4+1=21. So B is correct. Therefore, answer is B.But let me check again the problem statement once more to be sure. Because sometimes in such problems, there might be a different interpretation.Wait, the problem says &quot;the graph of the function y = x² (x &gt; 0) has a tangent line at the point (a_k, a_k²) that intersects the x-axis at the abscissa a_{k+1}&quot;. So, starting from (a_k, a_k²), the tangent line intersects x-axis at a_{k+1}. So the x-intercept is a_{k+1}. So yes, according to the calculation, it&#39;s a_k/2. Therefore, the sequence is geometric with ratio 1/2, starting from 16. So, the terms are 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, etc. Therefore, the sum a₁ + a₃ + a₅ is 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. So answer B. So the correct answer is B:21.But since the options include 24 and 30, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the tangent line equation.For example, take a general point (c, c²). The derivative is 2c, so the tangent line at this point is y = 2c(x - c) + c² = 2c x - 2c² + c² = 2c x - c². The x-intercept is found by setting y=0:0 = 2c x - c² =&gt; 2c x = c² =&gt; x = c/2. So yes, x-intercept is at c/2. Therefore, if the tangent at (c, c²) intersects x-axis at c/2. So, indeed, a_{k+1} = a_k / 2. So the sequence is a geometric sequence with first term 16 and ratio 1/2. Then, the terms are 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, etc. Therefore, the sum a₁ + a₃ + a₅ = 16 + 4 + 1 =21. So answer is B.Therefore, I think the correct answer is B:21.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( y = x^2 ) for ( x &gt; 0 ), we need to find the value of ( a_1 + a_3 + a_5 ) where the tangent line at the point ( (a_k, a_k^2) ) intersects the x-axis at ( a_{k+1} ) and ( a_1 = 16 ).1. Equation of the Tangent Line:   - The derivative of ( y = x^2 ) is ( y&#39; = 2x ). At ( x = a_k ), the slope of the tangent line is ( 2a_k ).   - The equation of the tangent line at ( (a_k, a_k^2) ) is:     [     y - a_k^2 = 2a_k (x - a_k)     ]   - Simplifying this equation:     [     y = 2a_k x - a_k^2     ]2. Finding the x-intercept:   - Setting ( y = 0 ) to find the x-intercept:     [     0 = 2a_k x - a_k^2     ]   - Solving for ( x ):     [     x = frac{a_k^2}{2a_k} = frac{a_k}{2}     ]   - Therefore, ( a_{k+1} = frac{a_k}{2} ).3. Sequence of Terms:   - The sequence ( {a_k} ) is a geometric sequence with the first term ( a_1 = 16 ) and common ratio ( frac{1}{2} ).   - Calculating the terms:     [     a_1 = 16, quad a_2 = 8, quad a_3 = 4, quad a_4 = 2, quad a_5 = 1     ]4. Sum of Terms:   - Summing ( a_1 ), ( a_3 ), and ( a_5 ):     [     a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21     ]Thus, the value of ( a_1 + a_3 + a_5 ) is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-22911720></div><p class="review-content" data-v-22911720><span class="icon" data-v-22911720>🔑:</span>According to the problem, y&#39;=2x,  thus, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function y=x^{2} (x &gt; 0) at the point (a_{k},a_{k}^{2}) is y-a_{k}^{2}=2a_{k}(x-a_{k}).  Setting y=0, we get x= dfrac {1}{2}a_{k}, which means a_{k+1}= dfrac {1}{2}a_{k},  therefore, the sequence {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence with a_{n}=16×( dfrac {1}{2})^{n-1}. Thus, a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}=16+4+1=21.  Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}.  By utilizing the geometric meaning of the derivative, first, we find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function y=x^{2} (x &gt; 0) at the point (a_{k},a_{k}^{2}), and then find the abscissa where it intersects the x-axis, which allows us to derive the recursive formula for the sequence {a_{n}}. Solving for the general formula of the sequence and substituting the values gives the solution.  This problem comprehensively examines the geometric meaning of the derivative, the definition of a geometric sequence, and its general formula.

The problem says that EC is twice AE, and FC is twice BF. The area of triangle BEF is 90, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. First, let me sketch a parallelogram in my mind. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, AB is parallel and equal to CD, and AD is parallel and equal to BC. Now, points E and F are mentioned. Let me figure out where they are. The problem says EC = 2 AE, so point E must be on a line segment where EC is twice as long as AE. Since we&#39;re dealing with a parallelogram, maybe E is on diagonal AC? Because diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, but here the ratio is 2:1 instead of 1:1. Wait, EC = 2 AE, so that would mean if we consider diagonal AC, then point E divides AC into segments AE and EC with EC being twice as long as AE. So, AE : EC = 1:2. That makes sense. So E is a point on diagonal AC such that AE is one-third of AC and EC is two-thirds of AC.Similarly, FC = 2 BF. So point F is on another line segment. Let&#39;s see, in the parallelogram, maybe FC is on side BC? Wait, FC and BF. If FC is twice BF, then BF : FC = 1:2. So F divides BC into BF and FC with FC being twice as long as BF. Therefore, BF is one-third of BC, and FC is two-thirds. So F is closer to B than to C. But BC is a side of the parallelogram, so if BC is, say, length L, then BF = L/3 and FC = 2L/3.So, in summary, E divides diagonal AC in a 1:2 ratio, and F divides side BC in a 1:2 ratio. Then, the area of triangle BEF is given as 90, and we need to find the area of triangle ACD.Wait, triangle ACD? But in a parallelogram ABCD, the diagonal AC divides it into two congruent triangles, ABC and ADC. So the area of triangle ACD should be half the area of the parallelogram. If I can find the area of the parallelogram, then dividing by 2 will give the area of triangle ACD. So maybe I need to relate the given area of triangle BEF to the area of the parallelogram.Let me try to figure out how triangle BEF is situated in the parallelogram. Points B, E, and F. So point B is a vertex of the parallelogram. Point E is on diagonal AC, one-third from A. Point F is on BC, one-third from B. So connecting these three points forms triangle BEF. To find the area of triangle BEF, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let&#39;s assign coordinates to the parallelogram to make calculations easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since it&#39;s a parallelogram, let me assume vector AB is along the x-axis, and vector AD is along the y-axis. Wait, but in a general parallelogram, the sides don&#39;t have to be axis-aligned. Maybe it&#39;s better to assign coordinates in such a way that calculations are manageable. Alternatively, use vectors.Alternatively, let&#39;s suppose that the base AB is of length &#39;a&#39; and the height is &#39;h&#39;, so the area of the parallelogram is a*h. But maybe coordinates are easier. Let me set coordinates as follows: Let’s place point A at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point B can be at (b,0), point D at (0,d), so point C would be at (b,d). Then diagonal AC goes from (0,0) to (b,d). Point E divides AC in the ratio AE:EC = 1:2, so coordinates of E can be found by section formula. So E is [(2*0 + 1*b)/(1+2), (2*0 + 1*d)/(1+2)] = (b/3, d/3).Similarly, point F is on BC. Since BC goes from (b,0) to (b,d). Wait, no, point B is at (b,0), point C is at (b,d). So BC is a vertical line segment from (b,0) to (b,d). Wait, but FC = 2 BF. So BF : FC = 1:2. Therefore, BF is one-third of BC. Since BC is length d, then BF = d/3, FC = 2d/3. Therefore, coordinates of F are (b, BF) = (b, d/3). Wait, BC is from (b,0) to (b,d), so moving up from B, which is at (b,0), by d/3, so F is at (b, d/3).Therefore, coordinates:A: (0,0)B: (b,0)C: (b,d)D: (0,d)E: (b/3, d/3)F: (b, d/3)Now, triangle BEF is formed by points B (b,0), E (b/3, d/3), and F (b, d/3). Let me confirm:Point B is (b,0)Point E is (b/3, d/3)Point F is (b, d/3)So connecting these three points. Let&#39;s compute the area of triangle BEF.To compute the area of triangle given three coordinates, we can use the shoelace formula.Coordinates:B: (b, 0)E: (b/3, d/3)F: (b, d/3)Using the shoelace formula:Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Plugging in:x1 = b, y1 = 0x2 = b/3, y2 = d/3x3 = b, y3 = d/3Compute:1/2 | b*(d/3 - d/3) + (b/3)*(d/3 - 0) + b*(0 - d/3) |Simplify term by term:First term: b*(0) = 0Second term: (b/3)*(d/3) = b d / 9Third term: b*(-d/3) = -b d /3Sum: 0 + b d /9 - b d /3 = (b d /9 - 3 b d /9) = (-2 b d)/9Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:Area = (1/2)*| -2 b d /9 | = (1/2)*(2 b d /9) = b d /9Given that the area of triangle BEF is 90, so:b d /9 = 90 =&gt; b d = 810But the area of the parallelogram ABCD is base * height. If we consider AB as the base, which is length b, and the height is d (since AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,d)), then the area of the parallelogram is b*d = 810. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is half of that, which is 810 /2 = 405.Wait, so is it 405? Let me verify.But wait, in my coordinate system, the area of the parallelogram is indeed b*d. Then triangle ACD is half of the parallelogram, so yes, 810 /2 = 405. Therefore, the answer should be 405. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me check my calculations again to make sure.First, coordinates:A(0,0), B(b,0), C(b,d), D(0,d). E divides AC in ratio 1:2, so E is (b/3, d/3). F is on BC, 1/3 from B, so since BC is vertical from (b,0) to (b,d), moving up d/3 gives F at (b, d/3). Then area of triangle BEF:Using coordinates: B(b,0), E(b/3, d/3), F(b, d/3).Using shoelace formula:Compute the area as 1/2 |sum|So:List the coordinates:B: (b,0)E: (b/3, d/3)F: (b, d/3)Back to B: (b,0)Compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i:First term: x_B y_E - x_E y_B = b*(d/3) - (b/3)*0 = b d /3Second term: x_E y_F - x_F y_E = (b/3)*(d/3) - b*(d/3) = (b d /9) - (b d /3) = -2 b d /9Third term: x_F y_B - x_B y_F = b*0 - b*(d/3) = -b d /3Total sum: (b d /3) + (-2 b d /9) + (-b d /3) = (b d /3 - b d /3) + (-2 b d /9) = -2 b d /9Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2: | -2 b d /9 | *1/2 = (2 b d /9)*1/2 = b d /9. So yes, area is b d /9 =90, so b d=810.Therefore, area of parallelogram is 810, so area of triangle ACD is 810/2=405.Therefore, the answer is 405.But let me think again to make sure there&#39;s no mistake here. The key was assigning coordinates correctly and computing the area of triangle BEF. Let me see another way to compute the area of triangle BEF.Alternatively, since in coordinate system, points B, E, F.Looking at points B(b,0), E(b/3, d/3), F(b, d/3). So, from point B, we can see that E is located at (b/3, d/3), which is to the left b/3 - b = -2b/3 in x-direction and up d/3 in y-direction. Point F is straight up from B along BC to d/3. So, triangle BEF is a triangle with base BF along BC and something else.Wait, actually, looking at points B, E, F: since both E and F have the same y-coordinate, d/3. Wait, no. E has y-coordinate d/3, and F has y-coordinate d/3. Wait, no. Wait, E is (b/3, d/3), and F is (b, d/3). So points E and F are both at height d/3, so the line EF is horizontal? Yes, because they have the same y-coordinate. Therefore, triangle BEF is a triangle with base BF and height the horizontal distance from E to BF.Wait, BF is the vertical segment from B(b,0) to F(b, d/3). So BF is vertical, length d/3. Then, the base is BF, length d/3, and the height would be the horizontal distance from point E to the line BF. Since BF is vertical at x = b, the horizontal distance from E(b/3, d/3) to BF is |b - b/3| = 2b/3.Therefore, area of triangle BEF is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(d/3)*(2b/3) = (1/2)*(2b d /9) = b d /9, which matches the previous result. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, since the area is 90, b d = 810. Then the area of the parallelogram is 810, so triangle ACD is half of that, which is 405. That seems solid.Alternatively, if I didn&#39;t use coordinates, could I solve this with ratios?Let me try. In the parallelogram, since EC = 2 AE, so AE : EC = 1:2. So E divides AC into 1:2. Similarly, FC = 2 BF, so BF : FC =1:2. Therefore, F divides BC into 1:2.Now, let&#39;s consider the area of triangle BEF. To find this area, perhaps express it in terms of the areas of other triangles or the whole parallelogram.In a parallelogram, the area can also be related to the areas of triangles formed by various points.Alternatively, we can use mass point geometry or coordinate geometry as before.But since coordinate geometry worked well, and gave the answer 405, which seems consistent, I think that&#39;s the right approach.But just to be thorough, let&#39;s consider another method.Let’s consider the ratios. Since E divides AC in 1:2, then the coordinates approach showed that E is closer to A. Similarly, F is closer to B on BC. Then, triangle BEF is formed by connecting these points.Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors.Let’s take point A as the origin. Vector AB = vector u, and vector AD = vector v. Therefore, the coordinates in terms of vectors:A: 0B: uC: u + vD: vE is a point on AC such that AE : EC = 1:2. Therefore, E = (2*A + C)/3 = (2*0 + u + v)/3 = (u + v)/3Similarly, point F is on BC such that BF : FC = 1:2. Since BC is from B to C, which is vector u + v - u = v. Wait, no. Wait, BC is from point B to point C, which is vector (u + v) - u = v. But actually, in coordinates, from point B(u) to C(u + v), so vector BC is v. So point F divides BC into BF : FC =1:2. Therefore, F = B + (1/3)BC = u + (1/3)vTherefore, coordinates:E = (u + v)/3F = u + (1/3)vPoint B is u.So vectors BE = E - B = (u + v)/3 - u = (-2u + v)/3Vectors BF = F - B = (u + (1/3)v) - u = (1/3)vThe area of triangle BEF is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors BE and BF.So cross product BE × BF = [(-2u + v)/3] × [(1/3)v] = (-2u × v + v × v)/9But cross product of a vector with itself is zero, so this simplifies to (-2u × v)/9Therefore, the magnitude is | -2u × v | /9 = 2|u × v| /9Therefore, area of triangle BEF is (1/2)*(2|u × v| /9) = |u × v| /9Given that this area is 90, so |u × v| /9 = 90 =&gt; |u × v| = 810But |u × v| is the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors u and v, which is the area of ABCD. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 810, so the area of triangle ACD is half of that, which is 405. So again, same result. This confirms the answer.Therefore, regardless of the method—coordinate geometry or vector cross product—the area of triangle ACD is 405.Final Answerboxed{405}&lt;/think&gt;Given a parallelogram (ABCD) with points (E) and (F) such that (EC = 2AE) and (FC = 2BF). The area of (triangle BEF) is 90, and we need to find the area of (triangle ACD).1. Coordinates Assignment:   - Assign coordinates: (A(0,0)), (B(b,0)), (C(b,d)), (D(0,d)).   - Point (E) divides (AC) in the ratio 1:2, so (Eleft(frac{b}{3}, frac{d}{3}right)).   - Point (F) divides (BC) in the ratio 1:2, so (Fleft(b, frac{d}{3}right)).2. Area Calculation of (triangle BEF):   - Using the shoelace formula for points (B(b,0)), (Eleft(frac{b}{3}, frac{d}{3}right)), and (Fleft(b, frac{d}{3}right)):     [     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| b left(frac{d}{3} - frac{d}{3}right) + frac{b}{3} left(frac{d}{3} - 0right) + b left(0 - frac{d}{3}right) right|     ]     Simplifying:     [     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + frac{bd}{9} - frac{bd}{3} right| = frac{1}{2} left| -frac{2bd}{9} right| = frac{bd}{9}     ]   - Given area is 90, so (frac{bd}{9} = 90 implies bd = 810).3. Area of Parallelogram and (triangle ACD):   - The area of parallelogram (ABCD) is (bd = 810).   - The area of (triangle ACD) is half the area of the parallelogram:     [     text{Area of } triangle ACD = frac{810}{2} = 405     ]Thus, the area of (triangle ACD) is (boxed{405}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the area of triangle ACD in this parallelogram ABCD. They told me the area of triangle BEF is 90. Hmm, first, I should probably sketch the parallelogram to visualize where points E and F are. But since I don&#39;t have the figure, I need to figure out their positions based on the given ratios: EC = 2AE and FC = 2BF. So, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Let&#39;s assume ABCD is a standard parallelogram with AB parallel to CD and AD parallel to BC. Let me label the vertices: A at the bottom-left, B at the bottom-right, C at the top-right, and D at the top-left. Then diagonals would intersect at some point, but maybe E and F are on sides?Wait, EC = 2AE. So E must be a point on side AC such that the length from E to C is twice the length from A to E. Similarly, FC = 2BF means F is a point on side BC such that the length from F to C is twice the length from B to F. So E is dividing AC in the ratio AE:EC = 1:2, and F is dividing BC in the ratio BF:FC = 1:2. That makes sense. So E is closer to A, and F is closer to B. Now, the area of triangle BEF is 90. We need to relate this to the area of the entire parallelogram or triangle ACD. Since ACD is a triangle formed by three vertices of the parallelogram, which is half the area of the parallelogram. So if I can find the area of the parallelogram, then the area of triangle ACD would be half of that.Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the area can be found by base times height. But since we have ratios of segments and areas of triangles, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Assign coordinates to the points and express the areas using coordinates.Let&#39;s assign coordinates. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since it&#39;s a parallelogram, let me denote vector AB as (b, 0) and vector AD as (d, h), where h is the height. So coordinates would be:A: (0, 0)B: (b, 0)D: (d, h)C: (b + d, h)But maybe to simplify, I can set coordinates such that A is (0,0), B is (1,0), D is (0,1), so C is (1,1). Wait, but in that case, the sides are all of length 1, but maybe that&#39;s too restrictive. Alternatively, let me assume that the base AB is of length 3 units, so that when we divide AE:EC = 1:2, the points can be at integer coordinates. Wait, maybe that&#39;s complicating. Let&#39;s use variables.Let me consider the coordinates as follows:Let’s set point A at (0,0). Let’s let AB be along the x-axis with length 3a (so point B is at (3a, 0)). Then AD is along the y-axis with length 3b (so point D is at (0, 3b)), making point C at (3a, 3b). Then, since E divides AC into AE:EC = 1:2, the coordinates of E can be found by section formula. The coordinates of E would be [(2*0 + 1*3a)/(1+2), (2*0 + 1*3b)/(1+2)] = (a, b). Similarly, F is on BC such that BF:FC = 1:2. Wait, BC goes from B (3a,0) to C (3a,3b). So moving up from B to C. So F divides BC in the ratio BF:FC = 1:2. So coordinates of F would be [(2*3a + 1*3a)/3, (2*0 + 1*3b)/3]? Wait, no. Wait, the section formula is: if a point divides the line segment joining (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates are [(m x2 + n x1)/(m + n), (m y2 + n y1)/(m + n)].So for point F, which divides BC in the ratio BF:FC = 1:2. So B is (3a,0), C is (3a, 3b). So m:n = 1:2, so coordinates of F are [(1*3a + 2*3a)/(1+2), (1*3b + 2*0)/(1+2)] = [(3a + 6a)/3, (3b + 0)/3] = (9a/3, 3b/3) = (3a, b). Wait, but that&#39;s moving from B to C, so starting at B (3a,0), moving up to C (3a, 3b). If BF:FC = 1:2, then F is 1/3 of the way from B to C. So coordinates would be (3a, 0 + 1/3*(3b - 0)) = (3a, b). Yes, so F is (3a, b).Similarly, E is on AC, which goes from A (0,0) to C (3a, 3b), divided in the ratio AE:EC = 1:2. So using section formula, coordinates of E are [(1*3a + 2*0)/3, (1*3b + 2*0)/3] = (a, b).So E is (a, b), F is (3a, b). Now, triangle BEF is formed by points B (3a, 0), E (a, b), and F (3a, b).Let me confirm the coordinates:- B: (3a, 0)- E: (a, b)- F: (3a, b)Yes. So triangle BEF has vertices at (3a,0), (a,b), (3a,b). Let&#39;s compute its area.The area can be found using the shoelace formula. The coordinates are (3a,0), (a,b), (3a,b).Calculating area:Area = (1/2)| (3a*(b - b) + a*(b - 0) + 3a*(0 - b)) |  = (1/2)| 0 + a*b + 3a*(-b) |  = (1/2)| ab - 3ab |  = (1/2)| -2ab |  = (1/2)(2ab)  = abBut they told us the area of triangle BEF is 90. Therefore, ab = 90.So ab = 90. Now, we need to find the area of triangle ACD. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, the area of triangle ACD is half the area of the parallelogram.The area of the parallelogram is base times height. If AB is the base, length AB is 3a, and the height is the distance from D to AB, which is 3b (since AD is vertical in our coordinate system). Wait, in our coordinate system, the height would be 3b because point D is at (0, 3b). But actually, since we assigned coordinates with AD along the y-axis, the base AB is 3a and the height is 3b. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is 3a * 3b = 9ab. Then the area of triangle ACD would be half of that, which is (9ab)/2.But we already found that ab = 90. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is (9 * 90)/2 = 810/2 = 405.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.Wait, in my coordinate system, the parallelogram has vertices at A(0,0), B(3a,0), D(0,3b), C(3a,3b). The area of the parallelogram is indeed base * height. The base AB has length 3a, and the height is the vertical distance from AB to CD, which is 3b. So area is 3a * 3b = 9ab. Then triangle ACD is formed by points A, C, D. The area of triangle ACD should be half the area of the parallelogram, which is (9ab)/2. Since ab = 90, then (9 * 90)/2 = 810/2 = 405. So the answer is 405.But let me confirm the coordinates again. Triangle BEF is formed by (3a,0), (a,b), (3a,b). The area calculation via shoelace formula gives ab, which is 90. So ab = 90, correct. Therefore, substituting into the area of ACD gives 405. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this without coordinates.In a parallelogram, the area is twice the area of triangle ABC or twice the area of triangle ADC. Since triangle ADC is half the parallelogram. So if we can relate the area of BEF to the area of the parallelogram, then we can find the area of ADC.But how?Alternatively, since E divides AC in ratio 1:2, then AE:AC = 1:3. Similarly, F divides BC in ratio 1:2, so BF:BC = 1:3.But BC is equal to AD in a parallelogram, so BF is 1/3 of BC.Wait, maybe using area ratios.Let’s denote the area of the parallelogram as S. Then area of triangle ABC is S/2.Point E divides AC into 1:2, so AE is 1/3 of AC. Point F divides BC into 1:2, so BF is 1/3 of BC.Now, triangle BEF. Let&#39;s consider triangle ABC first. In triangle ABC, points E and F are located such that AE = 1/3 AC and BF = 1/3 BC.Wait, in triangle ABC, line AC is a median? Wait, no, AC is a side. Wait, in triangle ABC, if we have point E on AC and point F on BC, then triangle BEF is inside triangle ABC.The area of triangle BEF can be found using ratios.But perhaps using coordinate geometry was clearer.But since in coordinate geometry we arrived at ab = 90, and area of ACD is 9ab/2, leading to 405.Alternatively, maybe mass point geometry or vectors.But since coordinate geometry gave a straightforward answer, and the steps check out, I think 405 is the correct answer.But just to make sure, let&#39;s go through the coordinate method again with different variables.Let’s assign coordinates as follows:Let’s set A at (0,0), B at (3,0), D at (0,3), so C is (3,3). Then AC is from (0,0) to (3,3). E divides AC in ratio 1:2, so E is at (1,1). BC is from (3,0) to (3,3). F divides BC in ratio 1:2, so F is at (3,1). Then triangle BEF has vertices at B(3,0), E(1,1), F(3,1). Calculating the area:Using shoelace formula:Coordinates: (3,0), (1,1), (3,1)Area = 1/2 | (3*(1 - 1) + 1*(1 - 0) + 3*(0 - 1)) |= 1/2 | 0 + 1*1 + 3*(-1) |= 1/2 | 0 + 1 - 3 |= 1/2 | -2 | = 1But in this case, the area of BEF is 1, and ab in this coordinate system would be a=1 (since AB is 3 units, so a=1), and b=1 (since AD is 3 units, so b=1). Then ab=1*1=1, which matches the area of BEF=1. Then area of ACD would be 9ab/2 = 9*1/2=4.5, which is indeed (3*3)/2=4.5. So this checks out.Therefore, scaling up, if in the actual problem the area of BEF is 90, which is ab=90, then the area of ACD is (9*90)/2=405.Therefore, the answer is 405.Final Answerboxed{405}&lt;/think&gt;Given a parallelogram (ABCD) with (EC = 2AE) and (FC = 2BF), and the area of (triangle BEF) is 90, we need to find the area of (triangle ACD).1.

So, the question is: If cotangent of x is 1/2, what is the value of this big fraction they&#39;ve given? The expression is [(cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x)] divided by [cos x - cos x sin x]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.First, let&#39;s recall that cotangent x is 1/2. Cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so that means tan x = 2. So, if tan x = 2, then we can think of a right triangle where the opposite side is 2 and the adjacent side is 1, which would make the hypotenuse sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5). Therefore, sin x would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is 2/sqrt(5), and cos x would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is 1/sqrt(5). But maybe it&#39;s better to keep them as fractions with sqrt(5) in the denominator for now.But before plugging in the values, maybe simplifying the expression algebraically first would be better. Let me look at the numerator: (cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x). This looks like a difference of squares if I group the terms properly. Let&#39;s see:Let me denote the first term as (A + B) and the second term as (A - B), where A and B are some expressions. The product would then be A^2 - B^2. Let me check if that works here.Looking at the first factor: (cos x - 1 + sin x). Let&#39;s rearrange terms: (cos x + sin x - 1). The second factor is (cos x + 1 - sin x). Let&#39;s rearrange that as (cos x - sin x + 1). Hmm, not sure if that&#39;s helpful. Alternatively, maybe group terms differently.Alternatively, let&#39;s expand the numerator:First, multiply (cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x). Let&#39;s use the distributive property (FOIL method).Let me write them as:First term: (cos x - 1 + sin x) = (cos x + sin x - 1)Second term: (cos x + 1 - sin x) = (cos x - sin x + 1)Multiply these two:= (cos x + sin x - 1)(cos x - sin x + 1)Let me consider this as [(cos x + sin x) - 1][(cos x - sin x) + 1]. Let&#39;s use the distributive property here.Multiply term by term:First, (cos x + sin x)(cos x - sin x) + (cos x + sin x)(1) - 1*(cos x - sin x) - 1*1Let&#39;s compute each part:1. (cos x + sin x)(cos x - sin x) = cos^2 x - sin^2 x (since it&#39;s a difference of squares)2. (cos x + sin x)(1) = cos x + sin x3. -1*(cos x - sin x) = -cos x + sin x4. -1*1 = -1Putting all together:cos^2 x - sin^2 x + cos x + sin x - cos x + sin x -1Simplify term by term:cos^2 x - sin^2 x remains.Then cos x - cos x cancels out.Then sin x + sin x = 2 sin xThen -1 at the end.So the numerator becomes:cos^2 x - sin^2 x + 2 sin x - 1Hmm, let&#39;s see if we can simplify this further. Remember that cos^2 x - sin^2 x is equal to cos(2x), but not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, we can use Pythagorean identities.Let me recall that cos^2 x + sin^2 x = 1. So cos^2 x = 1 - sin^2 x. Let me substitute that in:cos^2 x - sin^2 x = (1 - sin^2 x) - sin^2 x = 1 - 2 sin^2 xTherefore, the numerator becomes:1 - 2 sin^2 x + 2 sin x -1Simplify:1 -1 cancels out, so we have -2 sin^2 x + 2 sin xFactor out -2 sin x:-2 sin x (sin x - 1)Alternatively, factor out 2 sin x:Wait, let me write it as 2 sin x - 2 sin^2 x = 2 sin x (1 - sin x)But with a negative sign. Wait:Wait, original is -2 sin^2 x + 2 sin x = 2 sin x - 2 sin^2 x = 2 sin x (1 - sin x)Yes, exactly. So numerator simplifies to 2 sin x (1 - sin x)Okay, so numerator is 2 sin x (1 - sin x). Now, the denominator is [cos x - cos x sin x]. Let&#39;s factor out cos x from denominator:cos x (1 - sin x)Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[2 sin x (1 - sin x)] / [cos x (1 - sin x)]Notice that (1 - sin x) cancels out from numerator and denominator, assuming 1 - sin x ≠ 0. So we need to check if 1 - sin x is zero. If sin x = 1, then cotangent x would be cos x / sin x = 0 / 1 = 0, but in our problem, cot x = 1/2 ≠ 0, so sin x ≠ 1. Therefore, it&#39;s safe to cancel.So after cancellation, we have:2 sin x / cos xBut 2 sin x / cos x = 2 tan xSince tan x = sin x / cos x. So the expression simplifies to 2 tan x.Given that cot x = 1/2, tan x is the reciprocal, which is 2. Therefore, 2 tan x = 2 * 2 = 4Therefore, the value of the given expression is 4.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I did all steps correctly.First, expanding the numerator:(cos x + sin x -1)(cos x - sin x +1) = cos^2 x - sin^2 x + 2 sin x -1. Then substituting cos^2 x - sin^2 x as 1 - 2 sin^2 x, leading to 1 - 2 sin^2 x + 2 sin x -1 = -2 sin^2 x + 2 sin x = 2 sin x (1 - sin x). Then denominator is cos x (1 - sin x). Cancel 1 - sin x, get 2 sin x / cos x = 2 tan x. Since tan x = 2, answer is 4. Looks correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to do it. Let me see. Let&#39;s check with actual values.Given cot x = 1/2. So, tan x = 2. Let&#39;s compute sin x and cos x.If tan x = 2, then we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side 2, adjacent side 1, hypotenuse sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5). Therefore, sin x = 2/sqrt(5), cos x = 1/sqrt(5). Let&#39;s plug into the original expression:Numerator: (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x)First compute each term:cos x -1 + sin x = (1/sqrt(5) -1 + 2/sqrt(5)) = (3/sqrt(5) -1)cos x +1 - sin x = (1/sqrt(5) +1 - 2/sqrt(5)) = (-1/sqrt(5) +1)Multiply these two:(3/sqrt(5) -1)(-1/sqrt(5) +1)Let me compute this:First term: 3/sqrt(5) * (-1/sqrt(5)) = -3/5Second term: 3/sqrt(5) *1 = 3/sqrt(5)Third term: -1 * (-1/sqrt(5)) = 1/sqrt(5)Fourth term: -1 *1 = -1So altogether:-3/5 + 3/sqrt(5) +1/sqrt(5) -1Combine like terms:-3/5 -1 + (3/sqrt(5) +1/sqrt(5)) = (-8/5) + (4/sqrt(5))Hmm, this seems messy, but let&#39;s compute denominator as well.Denominator: cos x - cos x sin x = (1/sqrt(5)) - (1/sqrt(5))(2/sqrt(5)) = 1/sqrt(5) - 2/5So denominator is 1/sqrt(5) - 2/5. Let&#39;s compute numerator and denominator:Numerator: (-8/5) + (4/sqrt(5)) = (-8/5) + (4√5)/5 = [ -8 + 4√5 ] /5Denominator: 1/sqrt(5) - 2/5 = (√5/5 - 2/5) = (√5 -2)/5Therefore, the entire expression is [ (-8 +4√5)/5 ] divided by [ (√5 -2)/5 ] = [ (-8 +4√5)/5 ] * [5/(√5 -2) ] = (-8 +4√5)/(√5 -2)Multiply numerator and denominator by (√5 +2) to rationalize denominator:Numerator: (-8 +4√5)(√5 +2) = -8√5 -16 +4*5 +8√5 = (-8√5 +8√5) + (-16 +20) = 0 +4 =4Denominator: (√5 -2)(√5 +2) =5 -4=1Therefore, the expression simplifies to 4/1=4. So same answer as before. So that confirms the answer is indeed 4. Therefore, my initial algebraic approach was correct.So even when plugging in the actual values, after some calculation, we get 4. So that&#39;s reassuring.Alternatively, maybe another way to think about the numerator. Let&#39;s look again at the original numerator: (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x). Maybe there&#39;s a trigonometric identity that can be applied here.Alternatively, let me consider writing the numerator as [ (cos x + sin x) -1 ] [ (cos x - sin x) +1 ]But maybe another approach. Let&#39;s set A = cos x -1 + sin x and B = cos x +1 - sin x. Then the numerator is AB. Let me compute AB:AB = (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x)Let me write this as [(cos x + sin x) -1][(cos x - sin x) +1]. Let me expand this:= (cos x + sin x)(cos x - sin x) + (cos x + sin x)(1) -1*(cos x - sin x) -1*1Which is exactly what I did before. So yeah, same steps. Therefore, maybe that&#39;s the most straightforward way.Alternatively, maybe using (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². Wait, if I can write the numerator as (something)^2 - (something else)^2.Looking at the two factors:First factor: cos x -1 + sin xSecond factor: cos x +1 - sin xNotice that if we let a = cos x + sin x and b = 1, then the first factor is a - b and the second factor is (cos x - sin x) +1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider arranging terms differently.Alternatively, set u = cos x, v = sin x. Then numerator is (u -1 +v)(u +1 -v) = (u +v -1)(u -v +1). Let&#39;s expand:= u(u) + u(-v) + u(1) + v(u) + v(-v) + v(1) -1(u) -1(-v) -1(1)Wait, maybe this is too tedious. Alternatively, use algebra:(u + v -1)(u - v +1) = u^2 - uv + u + uv - v^2 + v - u + v -1Combine like terms:u^2 - v^2 + ( -uv + uv ) + (u - u) + (v + v) -1 = u² - v² + 0 + 0 + 2v -1So numerator becomes u² - v² + 2v -1. Since u = cos x, v = sin x, then u² - v² = cos²x - sin²x, which is the same as before. Then we have cos²x - sin²x + 2 sin x -1. Which is same as before. So yeah, same result.Therefore, this seems to be the correct path.So all in all, after simplifying, the expression reduces to 2 tan x. Since tan x =2, then answer is 4. And verifying with actual values also gives 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given (operatorname{ctg} x = frac{1}{2}), we know that (tan x = 2). We need to find the value of the expression (frac{(cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x)}{cos x - cos x sin x}).First, we simplify the numerator ((cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x)):1. Expand the product:   [   (cos x + sin x - 1)(cos x - sin x + 1)   ]2. Use the distributive property:   [   (cos x + sin x)(cos x - sin x) + (cos x + sin x) - (cos x - sin x) - 1   ]3. Simplify each term:   [   cos^2 x - sin^2 x + cos x + sin x - cos x + sin x - 1   ]4. Combine like terms:   [   cos^2 x - sin^2 x + 2 sin x - 1   ]5. Use the identity (cos^2 x = 1 - sin^2 x):   [   (1 - sin^2 x) - sin^2 x + 2 sin x - 1 = -2 sin^2 x + 2 sin x   ]6. Factor out common terms:   [   2 sin x (1 - sin x)   ]Next, we simplify the denominator (cos x - cos x sin x):1. Factor out (cos x):   [   cos x (1 - sin x)   ]Now, we divide the simplified numerator by the simplified denominator:1. Cancel the common factor ((1 - sin x)):   [   frac{2 sin x}{cos x}   ]2. Recognize that (frac{sin x}{cos x} = tan x):   [   2 tan x   ]Given (tan x = 2), we substitute:   [   2 times 2 = 4   ]Thus, the value of the given expression is (boxed{4}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this trigonometric expression given that ctg x is 1/2. First, let me recall that ctg x is the cotangent of x, which is the reciprocal of tangent. So if ctg x = 1/2, that means tan x = 2. Hmm, right. So maybe I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine, since cotangent is cosine over sine. So ctg x = cos x / sin x = 1/2, which implies that cos x = (1/2) sin x. Maybe that relationship will help later.The expression I need to simplify is [(cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x)] divided by [cos x - cos x sin x]. Let me write that out step by step.First, let me look at the numerator: (cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x). That seems like a product of two binomials. Maybe I can expand it. Let me try.Let me denote A = cos x - 1 + sin x and B = cos x + 1 - sin x. So the numerator is A * B. Let&#39;s multiply them out.A * B = (cos x - 1 + sin x)(cos x + 1 - sin x). Let me rearrange the terms for clarity: [(cos x + sin x) - 1][(cos x - sin x) + 1]. Hmm, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe expand it term by term.First, multiply cos x by (cos x + 1 - sin x): cos x * cos x + cos x * 1 - cos x * sin x.Then, multiply -1 by (cos x + 1 - sin x): -1 * cos x -1 * 1 +1 * sin x.Then, multiply sin x by (cos x + 1 - sin x): sin x * cos x + sin x * 1 - sin x * sin x.So combining all these terms:= cos²x + cos x - cos x sin x - cos x - 1 + sin x + sin x cos x + sin x - sin²x.Now let&#39;s combine like terms:cos²x - sin²x (from the first and last terms),cos x - cos x cancels out,-cos x sin x + sin x cos x cancels out,Then we have -1,and sin x + sin x = 2 sin x.So altogether, the numerator simplifies to cos²x - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x.Hmm, let&#39;s check that again. Wait:Original expansion:cos²x + cos x - cos x sin x - cos x - 1 + sin x + sin x cos x + sin x - sin²x.Combine terms:cos²x - sin²x (from cos²x and -sin²x),cos x - cos x cancels,-cos x sin x + sin x cos x cancels,-1 remains,sin x + sin x = 2 sin x.Yes, that&#39;s correct. So the numerator is cos²x - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x.Now, let me recall some trigonometric identities. cos²x - sin²x is equal to cos(2x). But maybe that&#39;s not helpful here. Alternatively, cos²x can be written as 1 - sin²x. Let me try substituting that.cos²x - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x = (1 - sin²x) - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x = 1 - sin²x - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x = -2 sin²x + 2 sin x.So the numerator simplifies to -2 sin²x + 2 sin x. Factor that, we get -2 sin x (sin x - 1). Alternatively, factor out 2 sin x: 2 sin x (-sin x +1 ) = 2 sin x (1 - sin x). Wait, but with a negative sign: Let me check:-2 sin²x + 2 sin x = -2 sin²x + 2 sin x = 2 sin x (1 - sin x) - 2 sin²x? Wait, no:Wait, factoring:-2 sin²x + 2 sin x = 2 sin x (-sin x +1 ) = 2 sin x (1 - sin x). Yes, correct. Because 2 sin x (1 - sin x) = 2 sin x - 2 sin²x. But in the numerator, it&#39;s -2 sin²x + 2 sin x, which is the same as 2 sin x - 2 sin²x. So yes, numerator is 2 sin x (1 - sin x).Wait, but earlier when substituting cos²x - sin²x, we had:cos²x - sin²x = (1 - sin²x) - sin²x = 1 - 2 sin²x. Then subtract 1 and add 2 sin x:1 - 2 sin²x -1 + 2 sin x = -2 sin²x + 2 sin x. So yes, that&#39;s correct.So numerator simplifies to 2 sin x (1 - sin x).Now, the denominator is cos x - cos x sin x. Let&#39;s factor cos x:cos x (1 - sin x).Therefore, the entire expression becomes [2 sin x (1 - sin x)] / [cos x (1 - sin x)]. Notice that (1 - sin x) cancels out from numerator and denominator, provided that 1 - sin x ≠ 0. So assuming 1 - sin x ≠ 0, we can cancel those terms, leaving us with (2 sin x) / cos x.But 2 sin x / cos x is equal to 2 tan x. Since tan x = sin x / cos x. So the expression simplifies to 2 tan x.But we were given that ctg x = 1/2, which means tan x = 2. Therefore, substituting tan x = 2 into 2 tan x gives us 2 * 2 = 4.Wait, so the answer is 4? Let me check again.Wait, let me retrace:Numerator: (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x) simplifies to 2 sin x (1 - sin x).Denominator: cos x (1 - sin x).Cancel (1 - sin x), get 2 sin x / cos x = 2 tan x. Since tan x = 2, then 2 * 2 = 4. So yes, answer is 4.But let me verify all steps once again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting with the numerator:Expand (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x):= (cos x + sin x -1)(cos x - sin x +1). Let me use (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², but here it&#39;s a bit different. Wait, maybe arrange terms differently.Let me consider the two factors:First factor: (cos x + sin x) - 1Second factor: (cos x - sin x) + 1Let me denote u = cos x + sin x and v = cos x - sin x. Then first factor is u -1, second factor is v +1. Then product is (u -1)(v +1) = uv + u - v -1.But uv = (cos x + sin x)(cos x - sin x) = cos²x - sin²x.Then u - v = (cos x + sin x) - (cos x - sin x) = 2 sin x.Therefore, (u -1)(v +1) = uv + u - v -1 = (cos²x - sin²x) + 2 sin x -1.Which is the same as before. So that&#39;s cos²x - sin²x -1 + 2 sin x.So that&#39;s the same as before, leading to -2 sin²x + 2 sin x = 2 sin x (1 - sin x). Then denominator is cos x (1 - sin x). Then cancels 1 - sin x, gets 2 sin x / cos x = 2 tan x = 4.So that&#39;s correct.But let me check if there&#39;s any restrictions. When we cancel 1 - sin x, we have to make sure that 1 - sin x ≠ 0. So sin x ≠1. If sin x =1, then x = π/2 + 2πk. But ctg x = 1/2 at x where cos x / sin x =1/2. If sin x =1, then cos x =0, so ctg x =0, which contradicts ctg x=1/2. Therefore, sin x ≠1 in this case, so cancellation is valid.Therefore, answer is 4.Alternatively, another approach is to express everything in terms of sin x and cos x, then use the given ctg x =1/2 to find sin x and cos x, then substitute into the expression. Let me try that method to verify.Given ctg x =1/2, which is cos x / sin x =1/2. So cos x = (1/2) sin x.Also, we know that sin²x + cos²x =1. Substitute cos x = (1/2) sin x into that:sin²x + ( (1/2) sin x )² =1 =&gt; sin²x + (1/4) sin²x =1 =&gt; (5/4) sin²x =1 =&gt; sin²x =4/5 =&gt; sin x= ±2/√5.But we need to consider the sign. Since ctg x =1/2 is positive, that means cos x and sin x have the same sign. So sin x is positive if cos x is positive, and negative otherwise. However, unless specified, we can take both possibilities, but since the expression to compute involves squares and products, maybe the sign doesn&#39;t matter. Let&#39;s check.Compute the original expression:[(cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x)] / [cos x - cos x sin x]But let&#39;s compute sin x = 2/√5 and cos x =1/2 * sin x =1/2 *2/√5=1/√5. So cos x=1/√5, sin x=2/√5.Compute numerator: (cos x -1 + sin x)(cos x +1 - sin x)First compute cos x -1 + sin x: (1/√5 -1 +2/√5) = (3/√5 -1)Second factor: cos x +1 - sin x: (1/√5 +1 -2/√5) = (-1/√5 +1)Multiply them: (3/√5 -1)(-1/√5 +1). Let&#39;s compute this.= (3/√5)(-1/√5) + (3/√5)(1) + (-1)(-1/√5) + (-1)(1)= -3/5 + 3/√5 + 1/√5 -1= (-3/5 -1) + (3/√5 +1/√5)= (-8/5) + (4/√5)Now, compute denominator: cos x - cos x sin x = (1/√5) - (1/√5)(2/√5) = 1/√5 - 2/(5) = (1/√5) - (2/5)So the entire expression is [ -8/5 +4/√5 ] / [1/√5 -2/5 ]This seems messy, but let&#39;s compute it step by step.First, numerator: -8/5 +4/√5. Let&#39;s rationalize 4/√5 = 4√5 /5. So numerator: -8/5 +4√5/5 = ( -8 +4√5 ) /5Denominator:1/√5 -2/5. Rationalize 1/√5 = √5/5. So denominator: √5/5 -2/5 = (√5 -2)/5Thus, the entire expression becomes [ ( -8 +4√5 ) /5 ] / [ (√5 -2)/5 ] = ( -8 +4√5 ) / (√5 -2 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (√5 +2) to rationalize the denominator:Numerator: (-8 +4√5)(√5 +2 )Denominator: (√5 -2)(√5 +2 ) =5 -4=1So numerator:= -8√5 -16 +4√5 *√5 +8√5= -8√5 -16 +4*5 +8√5= (-8√5 +8√5 ) + (-16 +20 )= 0 +4 =4Therefore, the expression evaluates to4/1=4. Which matches the previous result. So this confirms that the answer is 4.So regardless of the method, the answer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given (operatorname{ctg} x = frac{1}{2}), we know (tan x = 2).

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that to find the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a particular point, I need two things: the derivative of the function at that point (which gives the slope of the tangent line) and the point itself. Then, using the point-slope form of a line, I can write the equation of the tangent line. Once I have the equation of the tangent line, I can find where it intersects the x-axis and y-axis. Those two intercepts and the origin will form a right triangle, and I need to find its area. Let me start by finding the derivative of y = x³. The derivative, dy/dx, is 3x². So, at the point where x = 3 (since the point given is (3, 27)), the slope of the tangent line will be 3*(3)² = 3*9 = 27. Therefore, the slope (m) of the tangent line is 27. Now, with the slope and the point (3, 27), I can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The point-slope formula is: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁). Plugging in the values we have: y - 27 = 27(x - 3). Let me simplify that. First, distribute the 27 on the right side: y - 27 = 27x - 81. Then, add 27 to both sides to solve for y: y = 27x - 81 + 27. That simplifies to y = 27x - 54. So, the equation of the tangent line is y = 27x - 54. Wait, let me verify that again. If I plug x = 3 into the tangent line equation, I should get y = 27. So, y = 27*3 - 54 = 81 - 54 = 27. That checks out. Good. Next, I need to find where this tangent line intersects the x-axis and y-axis. The y-intercept is straightforward. In the equation y = 27x - 54, the y-intercept is the constant term, which is -54. So, the line crosses the y-axis at (0, -54). Now, for the x-intercept, I need to set y = 0 and solve for x. Starting with 0 = 27x - 54. Adding 54 to both sides: 54 = 27x. Dividing both sides by 27: x = 54 / 27 = 2. So, the x-intercept is at (2, 0). Wait a minute, let me check that. If x is 2, then y = 27*2 - 54 = 54 - 54 = 0. Yes, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the tangent line intersects the x-axis at (2, 0) and the y-axis at (0, -54). Now, the triangle formed by these two intercepts and the origin (since the coordinate axes are the x-axis and y-axis) is a right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,0), and (0,-54). But wait, hold on. Actually, the triangle is formed by the tangent line and the two coordinate axes. So, the intercepts are (2,0) and (0,-54), and the two axes. So, the triangle is between those two intercepts and the origin. So, the vertices are (0,0), (2,0), and (0,-54). However, when I visualize this, the tangent line is crossing the x-axis at positive 2 and the y-axis at negative 54, which is below the origin. So, the triangle would actually be in the fourth and third quadrants? Wait, but the area is still a positive quantity, regardless of the direction. But wait, actually, the triangle formed by the tangent line and the two coordinate axes would have vertices at (2,0), (0,-54), and (0,0). So, it&#39;s a right triangle with legs along the x-axis and y-axis, but one leg is on the negative y-axis. However, since length can&#39;t be negative, the legs&#39; lengths are the absolute values of the intercepts. So, the base of the triangle is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is a length of 2 units. The height is from (0,0) to (0,-54), which is a length of 54 units. Therefore, the area of the triangle would be (base * height)/2 = (2 * 54)/2 = 54. Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I&#39;m not making a mistake here. Since the intercepts are at (2,0) and (0,-54), the triangle is formed with these two points and the origin. So, plotting these points: (0,0) is the origin, (2,0) is two units to the right on the x-axis, and (0,-54) is 54 units down on the y-axis. Connecting these points would form a triangle. The area of a triangle given by three vertices can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates. But in this case, since it&#39;s a right triangle, the area is just (1/2)*base*height, where base and height are the lengths of the legs. But here, the base is 2 units (distance from (0,0) to (2,0)), and the height is 54 units (distance from (0,0) to (0,-54)), even though the point is below the origin. Since area is a positive quantity, we take absolute values. So, the area is (1/2)*|2|*| -54 | = (1/2)*2*54 = 54. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 54. But let me double-check everything to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes. First, derivative of y = x³ is y’ = 3x². At x=3, the slope is 3*(9) = 27. Correct. Equation of tangent line: y - 27 = 27(x - 3). Expanding that: y = 27x - 81 + 27 =&gt; y = 27x - 54. Correct. Y-intercept is when x=0: y = -54. Correct. X-intercept is when y=0: 0 = 27x -54 =&gt; 27x =54 =&gt; x=2. Correct. So intercepts at (2,0) and (0,-54). Then the triangle vertices are (0,0), (2,0), (0,-54). Base is 2, height is 54, so area is (2*54)/2=54. Yes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let&#39;s use the formula for the area of a triangle given by intercepts. If a line intersects the x-axis at (a,0) and y-axis at (0,b), then the area of the triangle formed with the origin is |a*b|/2. In this case, a=2, b=-54. So, |2*(-54)|/2 = | -108 | /2 = 108/2=54. Yes, that confirms the area is 54. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{54}. Final Answerboxed{54}&lt;/think&gt;To find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line to the curve ( y = x^3 ) at the point ( (3, 27) ) and the two coordinate axes, we follow these steps:1. Find the derivative of ( y = x^3 ):   [   frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2   ]   At ( x = 3 ), the slope ( m ) of the tangent line is:   [   m = 3(3)^2 = 27   ]2. Write the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:   [   y - 27 = 27(x - 3)   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   y = 27x - 54   ]3. Find the intercepts of the tangent line:   - Y-intercept: When ( x = 0 ),     [     y = 27(0) - 54 = -54     ]     So, the y-intercept is ( (0, -54) ).   - X-intercept: When ( y = 0 ),     [     0 = 27x - 54 implies 27x = 54 implies x = 2     ]     So, the x-intercept is ( (2, 0) ).4. Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the intercepts and the origin. The vertices of the triangle are ( (0, 0) ), ( (2, 0) ), and ( (0, -54) ). The area is given by:   [   text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times |2| times |-54| = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 54 = 54   ]Thus, the area of the triangle is (boxed{54}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line to the curve y = x³ at the point (3, 27) and the two coordinate axes. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I remember that to find the equation of a tangent line to a curve at a particular point, I need the derivative of the function at that point. The derivative gives the slope of the tangent line. The curve here is y = x³, so let&#39;s find its derivative.The derivative of y = x³ with respect to x is dy/dx = 3x². At the point (3, 27), the x-coordinate is 3, so plugging that into the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line. Let me calculate that:dy/dx at x = 3 is 3*(3)² = 3*9 = 27. So the slope of the tangent line is 27.Now that I have the slope, I can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent. The point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point. Plugging in m = 27, x1 = 3, and y1 = 27:y - 27 = 27(x - 3)Let me simplify this equation to get it into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) so it&#39;s easier to work with. Expanding the right side:y - 27 = 27x - 81Adding 27 to both sides:y = 27x - 81 + 27y = 27x - 54So the equation of the tangent line is y = 27x - 54.Next, I need to find where this tangent line intersects the coordinate axes. The coordinate axes are the x-axis (y = 0) and the y-axis (x = 0). Let&#39;s find those intercepts.Starting with the x-intercept: set y = 0 and solve for x.0 = 27x - 54Adding 54 to both sides:27x = 54Dividing both sides by 27:x = 54/27 = 2So the x-intercept is at (2, 0).Now for the y-intercept: set x = 0 and solve for y.y = 27*(0) - 54 = -54So the y-intercept is at (0, -54).Wait a minute, the y-intercept is negative? That seems odd because the original point (3, 27) is in the first quadrant, but maybe the tangent line is steep enough that it dips below the x-axis when x is 0. Let me check my calculations again.Equation of tangent line: y = 27x - 54. Plugging x = 0: y = -54. Yep, that&#39;s correct. The slope is positive, and since the point (3,27) is above the x-axis, but the line is quite steep, it makes sense that when moving left from (3,27), the line would cross the y-axis far below. Okay, that checks out.So now I have the intercepts at (2, 0) and (0, -54). These two points, along with the origin, form a triangle? Wait, actually, the triangle is formed by the tangent line and the two coordinate axes. So the three vertices of the triangle are the x-intercept (2,0), the y-intercept (0, -54), and the origin (0,0)? Wait, no. Wait, the axes themselves are the x-axis and y-axis, so the triangle is formed by the tangent line crossing the x-axis at (2,0) and the y-axis at (0, -54). So the three points of the triangle are (2, 0), (0, -54), and (0,0). But wait, (0,0) is where the axes intersect. Hmm, but actually, when a line crosses both axes, the triangle formed with the axes would have vertices at the intercepts and the origin. Let me visualize this.Imagine the tangent line crosses the x-axis at (2,0) and the y-axis at (0, -54). So those two intercepts and the origin (0,0) form a triangle. But wait, actually, the triangle is formed by the line and the parts of the axes between the intercepts. So the vertices are (2, 0), (0, -54), and the origin (0,0). But in that case, the triangle is in the fourth and third quadrants? Wait, but (2,0) is on the positive x-axis and (0, -54) is on the negative y-axis, so the triangle would be between the positive x-axis, negative y-axis, and the tangent line. But the area would still be a positive value.However, sometimes area is considered as absolute, so maybe the area is just the absolute value of the product of intercepts divided by 2. Wait, let me recall the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at (a,0), (0,b), and (0,0). The area is |(a*b)/2|. But here, the x-intercept is 2 and the y-intercept is -54. So the area would be |(2*(-54))/2| = |(-108)/2| = | -54 | = 54. So the area is 54.But let me make sure this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using coordinates.The three vertices of the triangle are (2,0), (0, -54), and (0,0). To find the area, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices: (1/2)|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|. Plugging in (x1,y1) = (2,0), (x2,y2) = (0,-54), (x3,y3) = (0,0):Area = (1/2)|2*(-54 - 0) + 0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - (-54))|= (1/2)|2*(-54) + 0 + 0|= (1/2)| -108 | = (1/2)*108 = 54.So that&#39;s the same result. Therefore, the area is 54. But let me just verify if there&#39;s another way to think about this.Alternatively, the length of the base along the x-axis is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is 2 units. The length along the y-axis is from (0,0) to (0, -54), which is 54 units, but since it&#39;s below the x-axis, the height would be the absolute value, 54. Then, the area is (base * height)/2 = (2 * 54)/2 = 54. Yep, same answer.Wait, but actually, in this case, since the triangle is formed between the intercepts and the origin, the base and height are along the axes. So even if one intercept is negative, the lengths are positive. So taking absolute values, the base is 2, the height is 54, so area is (2*54)/2 = 54. So that&#39;s consistent.Therefore, the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line at (3,27) and the coordinate axes is 54.But let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn&#39;t skip anything:1. Find derivative of y = x³, which is 3x². At x = 3, slope is 27.2. Use point-slope form to get the equation of the tangent line: y = 27x - 54.3. Find x-intercept by setting y=0: x = 2. Find y-intercept by setting x=0: y = -54.4. The triangle formed by these intercepts and the origin has area |(2*(-54))/2| = 54.Yes, that seems correct. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in the calculations. The key steps were computing the derivative correctly, plugging in the point to get the slope, forming the equation of the tangent line, finding the intercepts, and then applying the area formula. All steps check out. So the answer should be 54.Final AnswerThe area of the triangle is boxed{54}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line to the curve ( y = x^3 ) at the point ( (3, 27) ) and the two coordinate axes, follow these steps:1.

At the point (3,27), the slope of the tangent line is y&#39;(3) = 3 times 3^2 = 27.The equation of the tangent line can be written in the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Substituting the slope 27 and the point (3,27) into the equation, we get 27 = 27 times 3 + b, which simplifies to b = -54.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = 27x - 54.To find the intercepts with the axes, we set y = 0 to find the x-intercept, and x = 0 to find the y-intercept. Setting y = 0 gives 0 = 27x - 54, which solves to x = 2. Setting x = 0 gives y = -54.The triangle formed by the tangent line and the two coordinate axes has a base of 2 (the distance from the origin to the x-intercept) and a height of 54 (the absolute value of the y-intercept). The area of a triangle is given by frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}, which in this case is frac{1}{2} times 2 times 54 = 54.Therefore, the area of the triangle is boxed{54}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-ccc77b65><span data-v-ccc77b65>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
