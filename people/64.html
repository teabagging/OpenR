Hmm, this looks like a trigonometric expression. I remember there are some product-to-sum formulas or maybe some identities that could help simplify this. Let me think.First, the expression is sin75 sin15 + cos75 cos15. Wait a second, that structure seems familiar. Isn&#39;t there a cosine addition formula that looks like cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB? Let me check that. Yes, the formula for cos(A - B) is indeed cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So if I compare that to our expression, it&#39;s exactly the same structure. So here, A would be 75° and B would be 15°, right?So applying the identity, sin75° sin15° + cos75° cos15° should equal cos(75° - 15°) which is cos60°. That simplifies things a lot! Cos60° is a known value. I think cos60° is 0.5 or 1/2. Let me confirm. Yes, cos60° is 1/2. So then, the entire expression simplifies to 1/2.But wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t mix up the signs. The formula for cos(A - B) is cosA cosB + sinA sinB, which matches our expression. So positive signs. If it were cos(A + B), it&#39;s cosA cosB - sinA sinB. But here we have a plus sign between the products, so it&#39;s indeed the cosine of the difference. So 75° - 15° is 60°, whose cosine is 1/2. Therefore, the value is 1/2.Alternatively, if I didn&#39;t recall that identity, maybe I could use numerical values. Let&#39;s compute sin75°, sin15°, cos75°, cos15° and then compute the expression.First, sin75° is sin(45° + 30°). Using the sine addition formula, sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So sin75° = sin45 cos30 + cos45 sin30. Sin45 is √2/2, cos30 is √3/2, cos45 is √2/2, sin30 is 1/2. So sin75° = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ (2.449 + 1.414)/4 ≈ 3.863/4 ≈ 0.9659.Similarly, sin15° is sin(45° - 30°). Using sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. So sin15° = sin45 cos30 - cos45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ (2.449 - 1.414)/4 ≈ 1.035/4 ≈ 0.2588.Similarly, cos75° can be calculated using cos(45° + 30°). Cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So cos75° = cos45 cos30 - sin45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588.Wait, that&#39;s the same as sin15°. Interesting. Then cos15° is cos(45° - 30°) = cos45 cos30 + sin45 sin30. So that&#39;s (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659.So let&#39;s compute sin75 sin15 + cos75 cos15:sin75° ≈ 0.9659sin15° ≈ 0.2588cos75° ≈ 0.2588cos15° ≈ 0.9659So multiplying:0.9659 * 0.2588 ≈ 0.250.2588 * 0.9659 ≈ 0.25Adding them together: 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5, which is 1/2. So that confirms it numerically.Alternatively, another method if I didn&#39;t remember the identity is to use the formula for cos(A - B). But since I already verified using two methods, I think the answer is 1/2.Wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can use complex numbers or another identity. Let me think. Suppose I write both products as parts of the cosine addition formula. Alternatively, maybe convert the products into sums. Let&#39;s try the product-to-sum formulas.The product-to-sum formula for sinA sinB is [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2, and for cosA cosB is [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)] / 2. So let&#39;s apply that.First term: sin75 sin15 = [cos(75 - 15) - cos(75 + 15)] / 2 = [cos60° - cos90°]/2.Second term: cos75 cos15 = [cos(75 - 15) + cos(75 + 15)] / 2 = [cos60° + cos90°]/2.Adding both terms together:[cos60 - cos90]/2 + [cos60 + cos90]/2 = [cos60 - cos90 + cos60 + cos90]/2 = (2 cos60)/2 = cos60 = 1/2.Yes, that&#39;s another way to see it. The cos90° terms cancel out, leaving 2 cos60 over 2, which is cos60. So that gives the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 1/2.So, after all these checks, I&#39;m confident that the value is 1/2.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;The given problem is to calculate the value of (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}).We recognize that the expression (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}) matches the structure of the cosine addition formula for the difference of angles:[cos(A - B) = cos{A}cos{B} + sin{A}sin{B}]Here, (A = 75^circ) and (B = 15^circ). Applying the formula, we get:[cos(75^circ - 15^circ) = cos{60^circ}]We know that (cos{60^circ} = frac{1}{2}).To verify, we can use product-to-sum formulas:- For (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ}):  [  sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} = frac{cos(75^circ - 15^circ) - cos(75^circ + 15^circ)}{2} = frac{cos{60^circ} - cos{90^circ}}{2}  ]- For (cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}):  [  cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ} = frac{cos(75^circ - 15^circ) + cos(75^circ + 15^circ)}{2} = frac{cos{60^circ} + cos{90^circ}}{2}  ]Adding these results:[frac{cos{60^circ} - cos{90^circ}}{2} + frac{cos{60^circ} + cos{90^circ}}{2} = frac{2cos{60^circ}}{2} = cos{60^circ} = frac{1}{2}]Thus, the value of (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have to calculate the value of sin75° sin15° + cos75° cos15°. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember there are some trigonometric identities that involve products of sines and cosines. Maybe the product-to-sum formulas? Let me recall those. The product-to-sum identities are:sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2cos A cos B = [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)] / 2So, if I apply these formulas to each term in the expression sin75° sin15° + cos75° cos15°, maybe I can combine them somehow.Let me try that. Let&#39;s compute each part separately.First term: sin75° sin15°Using the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2Here, A is 75° and B is 15°, so:sin75° sin15° = [cos(75° - 15°) - cos(75° + 15°)] / 2That simplifies to [cos60° - cos90°] / 2Similarly, the second term: cos75° cos15°Using the identity cos A cos B = [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)] / 2Again, A is 75° and B is 15°, so:cos75° cos15° = [cos(75° - 15°) + cos(75° + 15°)] / 2Which simplifies to [cos60° + cos90°] / 2Now, let&#39;s substitute the known values of cos60° and cos90°.cos60° is 0.5, and cos90° is 0.So, substituting into the first term:[0.5 - 0] / 2 = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25And the second term:[0.5 + 0] / 2 = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25Therefore, adding both terms together:0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5Wait, so the value is 0.5? That&#39;s 1/2. Let me verify this another way to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Alternatively, I remember there is a cosine addition formula. The expression sin A sin B + cos A cos B looks familiar. Let me recall the formula for cos(A - B).Yes, cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So that&#39;s exactly the expression we have here! So, sin75° sin15° + cos75° cos15° is equal to cos(75° - 15°) = cos60°, which is 0.5. That matches the previous result. Oh, so there&#39;s a much simpler way to see this using the cosine of a difference identity. That makes sense. So instead of breaking it into product-to-sum formulas, recognizing the structure of the expression as the cosine of the difference of angles gives the answer directly.Therefore, the value is indeed 1/2. Just to be thorough, let me compute this numerically with the actual sine and cosine values.Compute sin75°, sin15°, cos75°, cos15°:First, convert degrees to radians because calculators often use radians, but maybe I can do this without a calculator.Alternatively, use exact values.But maybe approximate:sin75° ≈ sin(60° + 15°). Using sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinBsin75° = sin60° cos15° + cos60° sin15°Similarly, sin15° = sin(45° - 30°) = sin45° cos30° - cos45° sin30°But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, use known exact values:Wait, sin75° and sin15° can be expressed in exact forms.sin75° = sin(45° + 30°) = sin45° cos30° + cos45° sin30° = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659sin15° = sin(45° - 30°) = sin45° cos30° - cos45° sin30° = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588cos75° = cos(45° + 30°) = cos45° cos30° - sin45° sin30° = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588cos15° = cos(45° - 30°) = cos45° cos30° + sin45° sin30° = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 + √2/4 = (√6 + √2)/4 ≈ 0.9659So, plugging these exact values into the expression:sin75° sin15° + cos75° cos15° = [(√6 + √2)/4] * [(√6 - √2)/4] + [(√6 - √2)/4] * [(√6 + √2)/4]Notice that both products are of the form (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b².So first term:[(√6 + √2)/4] * [(√6 - √2)/4] = [(√6)² - (√2)²] / (4*4) = (6 - 2)/16 = 4/16 = 1/4Second term:[(√6 - √2)/4] * [(√6 + √2)/4] = same as above, [(√6)² - (√2)²]/16 = 4/16 = 1/4Therefore, adding both terms: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. So, the value is indeed 1/2. All three methods lead to the same result: 0.5 or 1/2. First method: product-to-sum formulas, resulting in 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.Second method: recognizing the cosine of difference identity, leading directly to cos60° = 0.5.Third method: expanding the sine and cosine terms with exact values and calculating the products, which gives 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.Thus, the answer should be 1/2. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in the reasoning, and all approaches confirm the result. Therefore, I&#39;m confident that the value is 1/2.Final AnswerThe value is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To calculate the value of (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}), we can use the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a difference:[cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B]Recognizing that the given expression matches the right-hand side of the identity, we let (A = 75^circ) and (B = 15^circ). Applying the identity:[sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ} = cos(75^circ - 15^circ)]Simplifying the angle difference:[cos(75^circ - 15^circ) = cos{60^circ}]We know that (cos{60^circ} = frac{1}{2}). Therefore, the value of (sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ}) is:[boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>To solve this problem, we can make use of the cosine angle addition formula: cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B Identifying A as 75^circ and B as 15^circ, we can write the given expression in terms of the cosine of the difference between two angles: sin{75^circ}sin{15^circ} + cos{75^circ}cos{15^circ} = cos(75^circ - 15^circ) Now, compute the difference of the angles and apply the cosine function: cos(75^circ - 15^circ) = cos(60^circ) We know that cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2}, so the given expression simplifies to: cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} Thus, the value of the original expression is: boxed{frac{1}{2}} </p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-01194480 data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review" data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review-title" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>❓:</span>Distribute 5 students into 3 dormitories, A, B, and C, with each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people.

Each dorm has to have at least 1 person and at most 2 people. Plus, student A can&#39;t go into dormitory A. The answer choices are 18, 36, 48, or 60. Let me break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s understand the problem. We have 5 students, including student A. We need to assign each student to one of the dorms A, B, or C. But each dorm must have at least 1 and at most 2 people. Also, student A cannot be in dorm A. So, the constraints are:1. Each dorm has 1 or 2 students.2. Student A is not in dorm A.Total dorms: 3 (A, B, C). Total students: 5. Since each dorm can have 1 or 2, the possible distribution of students per dorm must satisfy the total of 5. Let&#39;s think about how to split 5 students into 3 dorms with each having 1 or 2.Possible distributions:Since each dorm must have at least 1, the minimum total is 3 students (1 each). Since we have 5, which is 2 more than 3, we need to distribute those 2 extra students. Since each dorm can have at most 2, the only way is to have two dorms with 2 students and one dorm with 1. Because 1+2+2=5. Let&#39;s confirm: 1,1,3 is invalid (max is 2), 2,2,1 is valid. So the distribution must be two dorms with 2 students and one dorm with 1 student.So, first, we need to figure out the number of ways to assign 5 students into dorms A, B, C such that two dorms have 2 students each and one dorm has 1 student. But also, student A cannot be in dorm A.But before considering the restriction about student A, let&#39;s compute the total number of distributions without any restrictions, then subtract the ones where student A is in dorm A. Wait, but maybe it&#39;s better to directly compute the number of valid distributions where student A is not in dorm A.Alternatively, first compute the total number of distributions where each dorm has 1 or 2 students, then subtract those distributions where student A is in dorm A. However, we need to be careful with overlap. Maybe inclusion-exclusion, but perhaps it&#39;s easier to compute directly with the restriction.But let&#39;s first figure out the total number of distributions without considering the restriction, then adjust for student A&#39;s restriction.So, total distributions: First, determine which dorm has 1 student and which have 2. Since we have three dorms, the number of ways to choose which dorm has 1 student is C(3,1) = 3. So, there are 3 choices: either A has 1, B and C have 2; or B has 1, A and C have 2; or C has 1, A and B have 2.For each case, we can compute the number of assignments.Case 1: Dorm A has 1 student, B and C have 2 each.We need to choose 1 student out of 5 for A, then 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, and the last 2 go to C. The number of ways is C(5,1)*C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 5 * 6 * 1 = 30. But wait, since the dorms B and C are distinguishable, we don&#39;t need to divide by anything here. So total for this case is 30.Case 2: Dorm B has 1 student, A and C have 2 each.Similarly, choose 1 for B: C(5,1) = 5, then 2 for A: C(4,2) = 6, then 2 for C: C(2,2) = 1. So again, 5*6*1=30.Case 3: Dorm C has 1 student, A and B have 2 each.Same calculation: 5*6*1=30.Total distributions: 30 + 30 + 30 = 90.Wait, but hold on. Let me check this again. Because the problem states that each dorm must have at least 1 and at most 2. So each dorm is non-empty and has at most 2. But 5 students into 3 dorms, each 1 or 2, which only allows for two dorms with 2 and one dorm with 1. So total number of assignments is indeed 3*30=90. Hmm. But the answer choices are 18, 36, 48, 60. So 90 is not among them, which means that I must have overcounted. So where&#39;s the mistake?Wait, perhaps the problem is that when we choose students for each dorm, we are considering labeled students. However, are the students distinguishable? The problem says &quot;5 students&quot;, so yes, they are distinguishable. Each student is unique, so assigning different students to different dorms counts as different distributions.But perhaps in the answer choices, the answer is less than 90, so considering the restriction that student A cannot go to dorm A, so the answer is the total number of distributions (90) minus those distributions where student A is in dorm A. Let&#39;s compute that.But first, let me confirm that 90 is the total number of distributions. Let me think another way. The number of onto functions from 5 students to 3 dorms where each dorm has at most 2 students. But such functions must be counted with inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, since each dorm can have 1 or 2, and total is 5, which is 1+2+2. So the problem reduces to partitioning 5 distinguishable elements into 3 distinguishable subsets with sizes 1,2,2. The number of such partitions is equal to C(5,1)*C(4,2)*C(2,2) / 2! because the two subsets of size 2 are indistinct. Wait, but in our case, the dorms are distinct (A, B, C), so we need to multiply by the number of ways to assign the sizes to the dorms. So first, partition the students into groups of 1,2,2. The number of ways to partition is 5 * C(4,2) / 2! = (5 * 6)/2 = 15. Then, assign these groups to the dorms. Since the dorms are distinct, and one dorm will have the single student, the number of assignments is 3 (choosing which dorm gets the single). Then, the two groups of 2 can be assigned to the remaining two dorms in 2! ways. So total number is 15 * 3 * 2 = 90. Wait, but that&#39;s overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number is 3 * [C(5,1)*C(4,2)*C(2,2)] = 3*30=90. So same as before. Therefore, the total is 90. But answer choices are up to 60, so why?Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. It says &quot;distribute 5 students into 3 dormitories, A, B, and C, with each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people.&quot; So the total number is 90. But since student A cannot go into dormitory A, we need to subtract the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A.So total valid distributions = total distributions (90) minus distributions where student A is in dorm A.So let&#39;s compute the number of distributions where student A is in dorm A. Then subtract that from 90.So, how many distributions have student A in dorm A, with each dorm having 1 or 2 students.Again, the structure must be two dorms with 2 students and one dorm with 1. But since student A is in dorm A, let&#39;s consider cases based on whether dorm A has 1 or 2 students.Wait, dorm A can have either 1 or 2 students. But given that student A is in dorm A, we need to see if the dorm A can have 1 or 2, subject to the overall distribution.But in the problem, each dorm must have at least 1 and at most 2. So dorm A can have 1 or 2. However, the total number of students is 5, so if dorm A has 1 (student A), then the remaining 4 students must be split into dorms B and C, each with 2 each. Alternatively, if dorm A has 2 students (including student A), then the remaining 3 students must be split into dorms B and C, which would require one dorm with 1 and one dorm with 2. But wait, since dorms B and C each need at least 1 and at most 2, splitting 3 students into B and C would mean one has 1 and the other has 2. So total distributions where student A is in dorm A can be divided into two cases:Case 1: Dorm A has 1 student (student A). Then dorms B and C must each have 2 students. The number of ways is: since student A is alone in dorm A, we need to split the remaining 4 students into B and C, each with 2. The number of ways is C(4,2) = 6. Because choose 2 for B, the rest go to C. Since dorms B and C are distinguishable, it&#39;s 6 ways.Case 2: Dorm A has 2 students (including student A). Then we need to assign 1 more student to dorm A, and split the remaining 3 students into dorms B and C (with 1 and 2 students). The number of ways is:First, choose 1 student out of the remaining 4 to join student A in dorm A: C(4,1) = 4.Then, split the remaining 3 students into dorms B and C, which must have 1 and 2. The number of ways is C(3,1)*C(2,2) = 3*1=3. But since dorms B and C are distinct, assigning 1 to B and 2 to C is different from 1 to C and 2 to B. So actually, the number is 2 * [C(3,1)] = 2*3=6? Wait, let&#39;s clarify.If we have 3 students left, and we need to split them into B and C with sizes 1 and 2. The number of ways is:Choose 1 student for B and 2 for C: C(3,1) = 3.Alternatively, choose 2 students for B and 1 for C: C(3,2) = 3.Since B and C are different dorms, both are possible. Therefore, total ways are 3 + 3 = 6.Alternatively, since it&#39;s equivalent to assigning each of the 3 students to either B or C, with exactly 1 in one dorm and 2 in the other. The number is 2 * C(3,1) = 6.Therefore, for case 2: 4 (for choosing the second student in A) * 6 (for splitting the remaining 3 into B and C) = 24.Therefore, total number of distributions where student A is in dorm A is case1 + case2: 6 + 24 = 30.Therefore, the total number of distributions without student A in dorm A is total distributions (90) minus distributions with student A in dorm A (30) = 60. But 60 is option D. However, the answer choices are A:18, B:36, C:48, D:60. So is D the answer? But wait, the answer isn&#39;t 60. Wait, but according to this calculation, yes. But let me check again.Wait, let&#39;s recast the problem. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s first consider the possible distributions where student A is not in dorm A, and count them directly.Since student A can be in dorm B or C. So we can split into cases based on where student A is assigned.Case 1: Student A is in dorm B.Case 2: Student A is in dorm C.Let&#39;s compute each case.Case 1: Student A is in dorm B. Now, we need to distribute the remaining 4 students into dorms A, B, C, with each dorm having 1 or 2, and considering that dorm B already has student A. So dorm B can have 1 or 2 students in total.Similarly, the total number of students is 5: student A is in B, so remaining 4 students need to be assigned to A, B, C, with each dorm having at least 1 and at most 2.Wait, but dorm A must have at least 1. Let me structure this.Since student A is in dorm B, dorm B already has 1 student (A). The remaining 4 students need to be assigned to A, B, C, with each dorm having at least 1, at most 2.But dorm A must have at least 1, so we need to assign at least 1 of the remaining 4 to A. Dorms B and C can have up to 2 each (but dorm B already has 1, so it can have 1 more). Similarly, dorm C can have 1 or 2.Let me think of the possible distributions. Let me denote the number of students in each dorm as (A, B, C). Since student A is already in B, the total would be (a, b+1, c), where a + b + c = 4, with a ≥1, b ≤1 (since B can have at most 2, already has 1), c ≤2. Also, each dorm must have at least 1, so A ≥1, B ≥1 (already satisfied), C ≥1. Therefore:Constraints:- a: 1 or 2 (since a ≤2 and a ≥1)- b: 0 or 1 (since B can have at most 2, already has 1)- c: 1 or 2 (since c ≤2 and c ≥1)But a + b + c =4.Possible combinations:1. a=1, b=1, c=2 (1+1+2=4)2. a=1, b=0, c=3 → invalid (c=3 exceeds max)3. a=2, b=0, c=2 (2+0+2=4)4. a=2, b=1, c=1 (2+1+1=4)But wait:Wait, let&#39;s check all possibilities:Possible values for a:1,2For a=1:Then b + c = 3. But since b can be at most 1 (since dorm B can take at most 1 more), and c can be at most 2. So b=1, c=2 (1+2=3). That&#39;s valid.If b=0, then c=3, which is invalid.For a=2:Then b + c =2.Possible b=0, c=2.Or b=1, c=1.Both are valid.Therefore, possible distributions:1. (a=1, b=1, c=2)2. (a=2, b=0, c=2)3. (a=2, b=1, c=1)Therefore, three subcases.Subcase 1.1: a=1, b=1, c=2.In this case, dorm A has 1, dorm B has 2 (including student A), dorm C has 2.Number of ways:First, assign 1 student to A from the remaining 4: C(4,1)=4.Then, since dorm B already has student A, we need to assign 1 more student to dorm B: C(3,1)=3 (since 4-1=3 left after assigning A).Then, assign the remaining 2 students to dorm C: C(2,2)=1.Total ways: 4*3*1=12.Subcase 1.2: a=2, b=0, c=2.Dorm A has 2, dorm B has 1 (student A), dorm C has 2.Number of ways:Choose 2 students for A: C(4,2)=6.Then, dorm B remains with student A only, so no more students.Then, assign the remaining 2 students to dorm C: C(2,2)=1.Total ways: 6*1*1=6.Subcase 1.3: a=2, b=1, c=1.Dorm A has 2, dorm B has 2 (student A +1), dorm C has 1.Number of ways:Choose 2 students for A: C(4,2)=6.Then, choose 1 student for dorm B from the remaining 2: C(2,1)=2.Then, the last student goes to C: C(1,1)=1.Total ways: 6*2*1=12.Total for Case 1 (student A in B): 12 +6 +12=30.Case 2: Student A is in dorm C.By symmetry, this will be the same as Case 1, but swapping B and C. Therefore, the number of ways is also 30.Wait, but hold on, if student A is in C, then the constraints are similar. So, following the same logic, we would get 30. Therefore, total number of distributions where student A is not in dorm A is 30 (Case1) + 30 (Case2) = 60. Which is again 60, option D.But wait, but according to the previous method, total distributions are 90, subtract 30 where student A is in A, gives 60. So both methods agree. But the answer options include 60 as D. So why does the problem present 60 as an option, but the answer is different? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, let&#39;s check the problem again: &quot;the number of different ways to distribute them without student A going to dormitory A is ( ).&quot; So according to my calculation, it&#39;s 60. However, the answer choice D is 60. So why does the assistant think it&#39;s 60? But the options given are A:18, B:36, C:48, D:60. So D is 60. Therefore, unless my calculation is wrong, the answer should be D.Wait, but let me verify again. Maybe there is an error in considering the distributions.Wait, let&#39;s take a simple example. Suppose there are 3 students and 2 dorms, each dorm at least 1. The number of distributions is 2^3 - 2 = 6. But using the formula C(3,1)*C(2,2)=3, multiplied by number of ways to assign the group sizes. Wait, maybe my original method is overcounting? Wait, no, in the first problem, with 5 students and 3 dorms with sizes 1,2,2. The number of distributions is 90 as above. But if we restrict student A not to be in dorm A, then total is 60. However, the answer choices include 60. But maybe the answer is different.Alternatively, maybe the original total is different. Wait, is 90 the correct total? Let me think. Suppose we have 5 students. The number of ways to assign them to 3 dorms with sizes 1,2,2 is equal to:First, choose which dorm has 1 student: 3 choices.Then, choose 1 student for that dorm: 5 choices.Then, divide the remaining 4 into two groups of 2: the number of ways is C(4,2)/2! = 3, because choosing AB and CD is the same as CD and AB if the dorms are indistinct. But in this case, the dorms are distinct (B and C, for example, if the single dorm is A). So after choosing the single dorm and the student, we need to assign the two groups of 2 to the other two dorms. Since the dorms are distinct, the number of ways is C(4,2) * C(2,2) =6*1=6, and multiply by 1 (since the two groups are assigned to specific dorms). Therefore, total per single dorm is 5*6=30, times 3 choices for the single dorm: 90. So that seems correct.Therefore, total distributions are 90. Then, if we subtract the 30 cases where student A is in dorm A, we get 60. So 60 should be the answer, which is D. But perhaps the problem is that in some distributions where student A is in dorm A, those distributions might not satisfy the other constraints. But no, we already considered the constraints in the counting.Wait, but let me check with another approach. Let&#39;s use inclusion-exclusion.Total number of distributions where each dorm has 1 or 2 students: 90, as before.Number of distributions where student A is in dorm A: 30, as before.Therefore, the answer is 90 - 30 = 60, which is D.But the answer is one of the options. So why the hesitation? Maybe there is a miscalculation here.Wait, let&#39;s verify the count for student A in dorm A.Case 1: Dorm A has 1 student (student A). Then dorms B and C have 2 each. The remaining 4 students are split into B and C. The number of ways is C(4,2) =6. So 6 ways.Case 2: Dorm A has 2 students, one of whom is student A. Then we need to choose 1 more student for dorm A: C(4,1)=4. Then, remaining 3 students are split into B and C, which must be 1 and 2. The number of ways is 2*C(3,1)=6. So total for case 2: 4*6=24.Total:6+24=30. That&#39;s correct.Therefore, 90-30=60. So answer is D:60. However, the options are given as A:18, B:36, C:48, D:60. So D is an option, so unless there&#39;s a mistake in reasoning, the answer is D.But let me consider another approach. Maybe the problem is that when we computed the total distributions, we considered different assignments where the same group is assigned to different dorms. But perhaps there is a different way.Alternatively, maybe using multinomial coefficients.The number of ways to distribute 5 students into three dorms A,B,C with sizes 1,2,2 is (5 choose 1,2,2) = 5!/(1!2!2!) = 30. Then, multiplied by the number of ways to assign these groups to the three dorms. Since one group is size 1 and two are size 2, the number of assignments is 3 (which dorm is the single). So total 30*3=90. So same as before.Therefore, same result. So subtracting the cases where student A is in dorm A gives 60. So answer D.But wait, I think I must be missing something. The answer options are up to 60. Maybe the correct answer is 60. But maybe the problem is that when student A is in dorm B or C, the count is different.Wait, let&#39;s take a concrete example. Suppose we have 5 students: A, B, C, D, E.Case1: Student A is in dorm B.We need to distribute the remaining 4 into A, B, C with dorms having 1 or 2.As before, possible distributions:Subcase1: A:1, B:1+1=2, C:2. So assign 1 to A, 1 to B (plus A), 2 to C.Number of ways: C(4,1)*C(3,1)=4*3=12.Subcase2: A:2, B:1+0=1, C:2. Assign 2 to A, 0 more to B (just A), 2 to C. Number of ways: C(4,2)=6.Subcase3: A:2, B:1+1=2, C:1. Assign 2 to A, 1 to B (plus A), 1 to C. Number of ways: C(4,2)*C(2,1)=6*2=12.Total:12+6+12=30. Then same for student A in C:30. Total:60. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, seems correct. So answer is D:60. But the options are given, and D is 60. So unless the problem is different... Wait, wait. Wait the problem says &quot;each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people&quot;. So each dorm must have at least 1 and at most 2. So total distributions are indeed constrained to two dorms with 2 and one dorm with 1. So my calculations hold.Therefore, the answer should be D:60. But the options include D as 60. Therefore, the answer is D.But just to be sure, let me check with another method.Alternatively, think of assigning each student to a dorm, then subtracting the invalid ones. But since each dorm must have 1 or 2, the total number is 90 as above. So 90 total valid distributions. Number of distributions where student A is in dorm A:30. So 90-30=60. Therefore, the answer is D:60. So I think that&#39;s correct.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To distribute 5 students into 3 dormitories (A, B, and C) with each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people, and ensuring student A does not go to dormitory A, we can follow these steps:1. Total Distributions Without Restrictions:   - The possible distribution of students must be two dormitories with 2 students each and one dormitory with 1 student.   - The number of ways to choose which dormitory has 1 student is 3 (either A, B, or C).   - For each case, the number of ways to distribute the students is calculated as follows:     - If dormitory A has 1 student: ( binom{5}{1} times binom{4}{2} times binom{2}{2} = 5 times 6 times 1 = 30 )     - If dormitory B has 1 student: ( binom{5}{1} times binom{4}{2} times binom{2}{2} = 5 times 6 times 1 = 30 )     - If dormitory C has 1 student: ( binom{5}{1} times binom{4}{2} times binom{2}{2} = 5 times 6 times 1 = 30 )   - Total distributions: ( 30 + 30 + 30 = 90 )2. Distributions Where Student A is in Dormitory A:   - Case 1: Dormitory A has 1 student (student A). The remaining 4 students are distributed between B and C (2 each):     - Number of ways: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 )   - Case 2: Dormitory A has 2 students (including student A). The remaining 3 students are distributed between B and C (1 and 2):     - Choose 1 more student for A: ( binom{4}{1} = 4 )     - Distribute remaining 3 students: ( 2 times binom{3}{1} = 6 )     - Total ways: ( 4 times 6 = 24 )   - Total distributions with student A in A: ( 6 + 24 = 30 )3. Valid Distributions Without Student A in Dormitory A:   - Subtract the invalid distributions from the total: ( 90 - 30 = 60 )Thus, the number of different ways to distribute the students without student A going to dormitory A is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have 5 students that need to be distributed into 3 dormitories: A, B, and C. Each dorm must have at least 1 person and at most 2 people. Also, we need to find the number of different ways to distribute them with the condition that student A doesn&#39;t go to dormitory A. The options given are 18, 36, 48, or 60 ways. Hmm, let me think.First, without any restrictions, how many ways are there to distribute 5 students into 3 dorms with each dorm having between 1 and 2 people? Well, since each dorm can have 1 or 2 people, and the total number of students is 5, the only possible distribution is that two dorms have 2 students each and one dorm has 1 student. Because 2+2+1=5. So the first step is figuring out how to partition the students into groups of 2, 2, and 1.But then, each of these groups has to be assigned to a specific dormitory: A, B, or C. So, first, we need to count the number of ways to divide the students into groups, and then multiply by the number of ways to assign those groups to the dorms.Wait, but there&#39;s also the restriction that student A cannot go to dormitory A. So maybe we need to adjust for that. Hmm, maybe it&#39;s easier to calculate the total number of valid distributions (with each dorm having 1 or 2 people) and then subtract the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A. Let me try that approach.First, total number of distributions without any restrictions (except the dorm capacities). So, we have 5 students. The possible distribution is 2, 2, 1. So the number of ways to split the students into groups of 2, 2, and 1 is given by the multinomial coefficient. That would be 5! / (2! * 2! * 1!) = 120 / (2*2*1) = 30. But then, since the two groups of 2 are indistinct, we have to divide by 2! to account for that. So 30 / 2 = 15. Then, we need to assign these three groups to the three dorms. Since the dorms are distinct (A, B, C), the number of assignments is 3! = 6. Therefore, total number of distributions is 15 * 6 = 90. But wait, is that correct?Wait, maybe not. Let me verify. If we split the students into groups of sizes 2, 2, 1, the number of ways is calculated as follows: first, choose 2 students out of 5 for the first dorm, then 2 out of the remaining 3 for the second dorm, and the last student goes to the third dorm. But since two of the dorms have the same size, we have to divide by 2! to avoid overcounting. So, that would be (5 choose 2) * (3 choose 2) / 2! = (10 * 3) / 2 = 15. Then, assigning these groups to the three dorms A, B, C. Since the dorms are distinct, each group can be assigned to any dorm. However, the group of size 1 is different from the groups of size 2, so perhaps the number of assignments is 3! = 6, because we have three distinct groups (two of size 2 and one of size 1). Wait, but are the two groups of size 2 distinguishable? If the groups are considered the same except for their members, then swapping the two groups of size 2 would lead to the same assignment. Therefore, when assigning to the dorms, the number of distinct assignments is 3! / 2! = 3. Wait, this is conflicting with my previous thought.Hold on, maybe I need to clarify. The process of dividing the students into groups is separate from assigning them to dorms. When we divide into groups of 2, 2, 1, the two groups of 2 are indistinct. So the number of ways to divide is 15. Then, when assigning these groups to the three dorms, which are distinct (A, B, C), we can assign the single student to any of the three dorms, and the two groups of 2 to the remaining two dorms. So the number of assignments would be 3 (choices for the single student&#39;s dorm) multiplied by 2! (assigning the two groups of 2 to the other two dorms). Wait, but since the two groups of 2 are indistinct, swapping them doesn&#39;t create a new assignment. So maybe it&#39;s only 3 ways? Hmm, no. Wait, if we have three dorms, and we need to assign the single student to one dorm and the two groups of 2 to the other two dorms. So the number of assignments is 3 (for choosing which dorm gets the single student) multiplied by 1 (since the two groups of 2 are indistinct and go into the remaining two dorms). So total assignments would be 3. Therefore, total number of distributions is 15 * 3 = 45. But that contradicts my previous result. So which is correct?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider labeling the dorms. Let me think of the assignment as: first, choose which dorm gets 1 student, then assign the two groups of 2 to the remaining dorms. There are 3 choices for the dorm with 1 student. Then, once that&#39;s chosen, the two groups of 2 can be assigned to the other two dorms. However, since the two groups are indistinct, there&#39;s only 1 way to assign them. So total assignments are 3 * 1 = 3. Therefore, total distributions would be 15 * 3 = 45.But that seems low. Wait, another approach: if the dorms are labeled, then maybe each division into groups of 2,2,1 can be assigned to the dorms in 3! / 2! ways. Because the two groups of 2 are indistinct, so we divide by 2!. So 6 / 2 = 3. Therefore, same as before. So total distributions are 15 * 3 = 45. But then, the problem says &quot;each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people&quot;. So the answer would be 45. But the options given are 18, 36, 48, 60. So 45 isn&#39;t even an option. That means my approach is wrong.Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the groups as indistinct. Maybe in reality, when assigning to labeled dorms (A, B, C), the order matters. Let me try again. Let&#39;s not use the multinomial approach, but instead think step by step.First, choose how many people go to each dorm. The possible distribution is 2, 2, 1. So the question is, how many ways to assign 2, 2, 1 students to dorms A, B, C, with each dorm getting exactly that number. Then, for each such assignment, we need to count the number of ways to assign the students, considering the restriction.Wait, maybe the initial step is wrong. Maybe the problem is about distributing the students into the dorms, where each dorm can have 1 or 2 students, but the exact numbers aren&#39;t fixed. But no, the total is 5, and each dorm has to have at least 1. Since 3 dorms, each with at least 1, that&#39;s a total of 3 students, leaving 2 more students to distribute. Since each dorm can have at most 2, those 2 extra students have to go into two different dorms. So each of those two dorms will have 2 students, and the third dorm remains at 1. Therefore, the only possible distribution is 2, 2, 1. So all valid distributions must have two dorms with 2 students and one dorm with 1 student.Therefore, the total number of distributions is equal to the number of ways to choose which dorm has 1 student, and then assign the students accordingly. So first, choose which dorm gets 1 student: 3 choices (A, B, or C). Then, choose which student goes there: 5 choices. Then, distribute the remaining 4 students into the other two dorms, with each of those dorms getting exactly 2 students. The number of ways to distribute 4 students into two dorms, each with 2 students, is (4 choose 2) = 6. But since the two dorms are distinct (since we&#39;ve already fixed which dorms are which when we chose which dorm gets 1 student), we don&#39;t need to divide by anything. So total number of distributions would be 3 (choices for the dorm with 1 student) * 5 (choices for the single student) * 6 (ways to assign the remaining students) = 3 * 5 * 6 = 90. Hmm, but that&#39;s different from the previous result of 45. Which is right?Wait, here&#39;s the discrepancy. In the first approach, I considered splitting the students into groups first and then assigning to dorms, leading to 45. In the second approach, choosing the dorm first, then the single student, then distributing the rest, leading to 90. Which is correct?Wait, let&#39;s take a simple case. Suppose there are 3 students and 2 dorms, each dorm can have 1 or 2 students. Then total distributions would be: possible distributions are 2 and 1. So number of ways: choose the dorm with 2 students: 2 choices, then choose 2 students out of 3: 3 ways, the remaining student goes to the other dorm. So total 2 * 3 = 6. Alternatively, splitting into groups first: 3! / (2!1!) = 3, then assigning to two dorms: since the groups are different sizes, number of assignments is 2 (which dorm gets the 2 and which gets the 1). So total 3 * 2 = 6. That matches.But in our original problem, the first approach gives 45 and the second gives 90. So where is the mistake?Ah! Because in the second approach, when we choose the dorm with 1 student (3 choices), then choose the single student (5 choices), then distribute the remaining 4 students into the other two dorms (each with 2). But in this case, the two dorms are distinct (since we&#39;ve assigned specific dorms already: for example, if we chose dorm A to have 1 student, then dorms B and C each get 2 students). So when we split the remaining 4 students into two groups of 2, the assignment to B and C matters. So the number of ways is (4 choose 2) = 6, which is correct. So 3 * 5 * 6 = 90.However, in the first approach, splitting the students into groups of 2,2,1: the number of ways is 5! / (2!2!1!) = 30, but since the two groups of 2 are indistinct, divide by 2! to get 15. Then, assigning these groups to the three dorms: since the dorms are distinct, we can assign the single student group to any of the three dorms, and the two groups of 2 to the remaining two dorms. The number of assignments is 3 (for the single student&#39;s dorm) multiplied by the number of ways to assign the two groups of 2 to the two dorms. Since the two groups of 2 are indistinct, there&#39;s only 1 way to assign them. So 3 * 1 = 3. Therefore, total distributions are 15 * 3 = 45.But these two approaches give different results. So which is correct? Hmm. Let me test with a smaller case.Suppose 3 students, 2 dorms, each dorm can have 1 or 2. So total distributions: 2+1. First approach: split into groups of 2 and 1: 3 ways. Assign to two dorms: the single student can go to either dorm, and the group of 2 to the other. So for each group split, 2 assignments. Total 3 * 2 = 6. Which matches reality.But if I use the second approach: choose the dorm with 1 student: 2 choices. Then choose the student: 3 choices. Then assign the remaining 2 students to the other dorm: 1 way. So total 2 * 3 * 1 = 6. Correct.But in the original problem, the second approach gives 90, and the first gives 45. So why?Ah! Because in the original problem, when we split into groups of 2,2,1 and then assign to dorms, we have to consider that when we assign the two groups of 2 to the two dorms, if the dorms are distinct (like B and C), then swapping the two groups would result in different distributions. However, in the first approach, we considered the groups of 2 as indistinct, so when assigning to the dorms, we don&#39;t differentiate between them. But in reality, since the dorms are distinct (A, B, C), assigning different groups to different dorms does create distinct distributions.Wait, so maybe in the first approach, when we split into groups of 2,2,1, and then assign to the dorms, even though the groups of 2 are indistinct, the dorms are distinct, so we should multiply by the number of permutations of the groups. So if we have three groups: size 2, 2, 1. The single group is unique, so we can assign it to any of the three dorms (3 choices). Then, the two groups of 2 can be assigned to the remaining two dorms in 2! ways. But since the groups are indistinct, swapping them doesn&#39;t matter. Wait, but the dorms are distinct. For example, if we have two groups of 2, group X and group Y. Assigning group X to dorm B and group Y to dorm C is different from assigning group Y to dorm B and group X to dorm C. But if the groups are indistinct, then those two assignments are the same. But actually, the groups are different because they contain different students, even if they are the same size.Wait, this is the key point. If the groups are considered different because they have different members, even if they are the same size, then assigning them to different dorms would result in different distributions. Therefore, when we split the students into groups of 2, 2, 1, the two groups of 2 are actually distinct because they contain different students. Therefore, when we assign them to dorms, swapping them would result in different distributions.Therefore, in the first approach, the number of ways to split the students into groups is 5! / (2!2!1!) = 30, and then assign these three distinct groups to the three dorms, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Therefore, total distributions would be 30 * 6 = 180. But that&#39;s way too high. Wait, that can&#39;t be.Wait, no. If the two groups of 2 are considered distinct, then the number of ways to split the students is (5 choose 2) * (3 choose 2) = 10 * 3 = 30. Then, assigning these three groups (two of size 2 and one of size 1) to the three dorms, which are distinct. So each group is assigned to a dorm, so 3! = 6 ways. Therefore, total distributions are 30 * 6 = 180. But this contradicts the second approach.Alternatively, perhaps the groups are considered indistinct if they have the same size but different members. Wait, this is a common point of confusion in combinatorics. When we use multinomial coefficients, we have to be careful about whether the groups are labeled or not.In this problem, the dorms are labeled (A, B, C), so the assignment is to labeled boxes. Therefore, the order matters. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is:First, decide which dorm gets 1 student. There are 3 choices (A, B, or C). Then, choose 1 student out of 5 to put there. Then, divide the remaining 4 students into two groups of 2, each going to the remaining two dorms. Since the dorms are labeled, the order in which we assign the two groups matters. So the number of ways to split 4 students into two groups of 2 is (4 choose 2) = 6, and since the two dorms are distinct, we don&#39;t divide by anything. Therefore, total ways: 3 * 5 * 6 = 90. However, this is the same as the second approach. So why does the first approach give 45? Because in the first approach, when splitting into groups first, we considered the two groups of 2 as indistinct, leading to division by 2!, but since they are assigned to labeled dorms, they should be considered distinct. Therefore, the first approach was wrong because it treated the groups as indistinct when they should be distinct.Therefore, the correct total number of distributions is 90. But the problem has options up to 60. So 90 is not even among the options. That suggests that either my reasoning is wrong or I misinterpret the problem.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the number of different ways to distribute them without student A going to dormitory A&quot;. So maybe the total number is 90, and then we subtract the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A. But let me check.Wait, actually, the problem states that student A (one of the five students) cannot go to dormitory A. So we need to compute the number of distributions where dormitory A doesn&#39;t contain student A, with the constraints on the number of students per dorm.So perhaps first, compute the total number of valid distributions (with each dorm having 1 or 2 students), then subtract the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A.But if the total number is 90, then we need to compute how many of those have student A in dormitory A, and subtract that from 90. But maybe 90 is not the correct total.Wait, let me think again. Let&#39;s use the correct approach. Since the dorms are labeled, the total number of distributions is:First, choose the number of students in each dorm. The only possible distribution is 2, 2, 1. So for each dorm, we can assign the number of students, but since the total is fixed, we just need to assign which dorm has 1 student, and the others have 2.Number of ways to choose which dorm has 1 student: 3 (A, B, or C).Then, for each case:Case 1: Dorm A has 1 student.Then, we need to choose 1 student out of 5 to put in A, then split the remaining 4 into B and C, each with 2 students. The number of ways is 5 * (4 choose 2) = 5 * 6 = 30.Similarly, if dorm B has 1 student: 5 * 6 = 30.If dorm C has 1 student: 5 * 6 = 30.Total distributions: 30 + 30 + 30 = 90. So yes, total is 90.But the problem says &quot;each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people&quot;, which matches. So total distributions are 90.Now, we need to compute the number of distributions where student A is not in dormitory A. So total distributions minus the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A.Number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A: Let&#39;s compute this.If student A is in dormitory A, then we have two cases based on how many students are in dormitory A. Since dormitory A can have 1 or 2 students.Wait, in the total distributions, each dorm has either 1 or 2 students, with exactly one dorm having 1 and the others having 2. So if student A is in dormitory A, then dormitory A can either be the one with 1 student or one of the ones with 2 students. Wait, but in our total distributions, each dorm can only have 1 or 2 students, but the specific distribution is fixed as 2,2,1. Therefore, dormitory A can be either the one with 1 student or one of the two with 2 students. Wait, no. Actually, in each distribution, exactly one dorm has 1 student and the other two have 2. So, depending on whether dorm A is the one with 1 student or not.So to compute the number of distributions where student A is in dormitory A, we have two scenarios:1. Dormitory A is the one with 1 student, and student A is in it.2. Dormitory A is one of the dorms with 2 students, and student A is in it.So let&#39;s compute both.First scenario: Dorm A has 1 student, and that student is A. Then, we need to distribute the remaining 4 students into dorms B and C, each getting 2 students. The number of ways is 1 (choosing student A for dorm A) multiplied by (4 choose 2) = 6 ways to split the remaining students. So total for this scenario: 1 * 6 = 6.Second scenario: Dorm A has 2 students, one of whom is student A. Then, we need to choose which dorm has 1 student (either B or C). Let&#39;s see:Wait, in total distributions, exactly one dorm has 1 student. If dorm A has 2 students, then either B or C has 1 student. So first, choose whether dorm B or C has 1 student: 2 choices.Then, choose the single student for that dorm (B or C) from the remaining 4 students (excluding student A, who is already in dorm A). Then, distribute the remaining 3 students into the remaining two dorms (one of which has 2 students and the other has 1 already). Wait, no. Let me rephrase.If dorm A has 2 students (including student A), then one of the other dorms (B or C) must have 1 student, and the other has 2. So:First, decide which of B or C has 1 student: 2 choices.Then, choose 1 student out of the remaining 4 to put in that dorm (say B). Then, the remaining 3 students (4 total minus 1 in B) must go to the remaining dorm C, but dorm C needs to have 2 students. Wait, hold on. If dorm A has 2, and one of B/C has 1, then the other must have 2. But 2 (A) + 1 (B) + 2 (C) = 5. Wait, 2+1+2=5. But we have 5 students. So:Wait, total students: student A is in dorm A. Then, we have 4 students left. If we put 1 student in dorm B, then dorm C must get 3 students. But dorm C can only have at most 2. Therefore, this is impossible. Wait, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, no. If dorm A has 2 students (including student A), then the remaining 4 students must be split into dorms B and C. But each dorm can have at most 2 students. So possible distributions for B and C: 2 and 2. But 2+2=4, which fits. But if we have to have exactly one dorm with 1 student in the entire distribution, then if dorm A has 2, the other two dorms must have 2 and 1. But 2+2+1=5. Wait, but 2 (A) + 2 (B) +1 (C)=5. Wait, but each dorm can have at most 2, which is satisfied here. Wait, but according to the problem statement, each dorm must have at least 1 and at most 2. So in this case, if dorm A has 2 students, then the other two dorms have 2 and 1. But how can we split the remaining 4 students into 2 and 1? Wait, 4 students can&#39;t be split into 2 and 1, because 2+1=3. Wait, but we have 4 students remaining. Wait, this seems conflicting.Wait, hold on. If dorm A has 2 students (including student A), then the total remaining students are 4. Since each of the other dorms must have at least 1 and at most 2. The only way to split 4 students into two dorms with each having at least 1 and at most 2 is 2 and 2. Because 1 and 3 is invalid (3 exceeds max), 2 and 2 is the only possibility. But in the total distribution, the original constraint was that each dorm has at least 1 and at most 2, and the total number of students is 5, which requires exactly one dorm with 1 and the others with 2. Therefore, if we fix dorm A to have 2 students, then the remaining two dorms must have 2 and 1 students. But this would require splitting 4 students into 2 and 1, which is impossible because 2+1=3 ≠4. Therefore, there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, this suggests that if dorm A has 2 students, the other two dorms can&#39;t satisfy the at least 1 and at most 2 constraint because we have 4 students left. Since 4 can&#39;t be split into two numbers each at most 2: 2+2=4, but that would mean both dorms have 2 students, leading to a total distribution of 2,2,2. But 2+2+2=6, which is more than 5. Wait, no. Wait, original total students is 5. If dorm A has 2, then the other two dorms must have a total of 3 students. Since each can have at most 2, the only possible split is 2 and1. But 2+1=3. So, for example, dorm B has 2 and dorm C has 1, or vice versa. So the remaining 4 students: wait, no. Wait, student A is in dorm A, so remaining students are 4. If we assign 2 to dorm B and 1 to dorm C, that&#39;s 3 students, but we have 4 left. That&#39;s a problem.Ah! Here&#39;s the mistake. If student A is in dorm A, which has 2 students, then we need to choose 1 more student for dorm A. So total in dorm A: 2 (student A and one more). Then, the remaining 3 students are distributed into dorms B and C, with each dorm having at least 1 and at most 2. So possible splits are 2 and1. So:Number of ways in this scenario:1. Choose which dorm (B or C) has 1 student: 2 choices.2. Choose 1 student out of the remaining 4 (since student A is already placed) to be in dorm A: 4 choices.3. Then, assign 1 student to the chosen dorm (B or C) with 1 student: 3 choices (since 4 -1 =3 students left after placing 1 in dorm A).Wait, no. Wait, step by step:If student A is in dorm A, and dorm A has 2 students, we need to choose 1 more student to join dorm A. There are 4 other students, so 4 choices.Then, the remaining 3 students (5 total - 2 in A = 3) need to be split into dorms B and C, each with at least 1 and at most 2. So possible distributions: 2 and 1. So:Choose which dorm gets 1 student (B or C): 2 choices.Choose 1 student out of the remaining 3 to put there: 3 choices.The remaining 2 students go to the other dorm: 1 way.Therefore, total number of distributions in this scenario: 4 (choices for dorm A&#39;s second student) * 2 (choices for which dorm has 1) * 3 (choices for the single student) = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24.Additionally, we have the scenario where dorm A has 1 student, which is student A. Then, the remaining 4 students need to be split into dorms B and C, each with 2 students. The number of ways is (4 choose 2) = 6. So total distributions where student A is in dorm A: 6 (from first scenario) + 24 (from second scenario) = 30.Therefore, total distributions where student A is not in dorm A: total distributions (90) minus 30 = 60. But 60 is option D. However, the answer options are A:18, B:36, C:48, D:60. So maybe 60 is the answer. But let me check my calculations again.Wait, total distributions: 90. Distributions with student A in dorm A: 30. So 90 - 30 = 60. So answer D:60. But let me confirm the 30 number.First scenario: dorm A has 1 student, which is student A. Then, remaining 4 students go to B and C, each with 2. The number of ways is 1 (student A in A) * (4 choose 2) = 6.Second scenario: dorm A has 2 students, one of whom is student A. Then:- Choose 1 more student for dorm A: 4 choices.- Then, remaining 3 students need to go to B and C, with one dorm getting 1 and the other 2.- Choose which dorm gets 1: 2 choices.- Choose 1 student out of 3 for that dorm: 3 choices.- The remaining 2 go to the other dorm.So total: 4 * 2 * 3 = 24.Total in both scenarios: 6 +24=30. So yes, 30. 90 -30=60. So answer is D:60.But the options are given, and D is 60. But let me check again if total distributions are indeed 90.Alternative approach: Assign each student to a dorm, with each dorm having 1 or 2 students. Since the only possible distribution is 2,2,1. The number of ways is equal to:First, choose which dorm gets 1 student: 3 choices.Then, choose 1 student for that dorm: 5 choices.Then, partition the remaining 4 students into two dorms of 2 each. The number of ways is (4 choose 2) =6. Since the two dorms are distinct, we don&#39;t need to divide by anything.Therefore, total ways: 3*5*6=90. Correct.Then, number of distributions with student A in dorm A:Case 1: dorm A has 1 student, which is student A. Then, remaining 4 students split into B and C: 6 ways.Case 2: dorm A has 2 students, including student A. Then:- Choose 1 more student for dorm A: 4 choices.- Remaining 3 students split into B and C: one dorm gets 1, the other gets 2. Number of ways:   - Choose which dorm gets 1 student: 2 choices.   - Choose 1 student out of 3: 3 choices.Total for case 2: 4*2*3=24.Total:6+24=30. So 90-30=60. So answer is D:60. But let me check with another approach.Alternatively, we can calculate directly the number of distributions where student A is not in dorm A. So:Each distribution must have dorm A containing either 1 or 2 students, none of which is student A.So two cases:Case 1: dorm A has 1 student, not student A.Case 2: dorm A has 2 students, none of whom is student A.Compute each case.Case 1: dorm A has 1 student, not student A. Then, student A must be in B or C. The total number of distributions here:- Choose the student for dorm A: 4 choices (excluding A).- Now, we have 4 students left, including A. These need to be split into dorms B and C, with each having at least 1 and at most 2. Since total students left are 4, and each dorm can have 1 or 2. However, since the overall distribution must have exactly one dorm with 1 student and the rest with 2, but dorm A already has 1. Therefore, dorms B and C must each have 2 students. So:The number of ways to split the remaining 4 students (including A) into B and C, each with 2. The number of ways is (4 choose 2)=6. But since dorms B and C are distinct, this is correct. So total for case 1:4*6=24.Case 2: dorm A has 2 students, none of whom is student A. Then, student A is in B or C. Now, we have:- Choose 2 students for dorm A: from 4 students (excluding A). So (4 choose 2)=6.- Remaining 3 students (including A) need to be split into dorms B and C, with exactly one of them having 1 student (since total distribution must be 2,2,1). So:Since dorm A has 2, the other two dorms must have 2 and1. So:Choose which dorm (B or C) has 1 student: 2 choices.Choose 1 student out of the remaining 3 (including A) to put there: 3 choices.The remaining 2 students go to the other dorm: 1 way.Therefore, total for case 2:6 *2 *3=36.Therefore, total distributions where student A is not in dorm A:24 +36=60. So again, 60. Therefore, the answer is D:60.Yes, this confirms it. So even with the direct approach, we get 60. Therefore, the correct answer is D:60.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of distributing 5 students into 3 dormitories A, B, and C, with each dormitory having at least 1 and at most 2 people, and ensuring that student A does not go to dormitory A, we can break down the solution as follows:1. Total Number of Distributions:   - The only possible distribution of students is 2, 2, 1.   - Choose which dormitory will have 1 student: 3 choices (A, B, or C).   - Choose 1 student for that dormitory: 5 choices.   - Distribute the remaining 4 students into the other two dormitories (each with 2 students): (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways.   - Total number of distributions: (3 times 5 times 6 = 90).2. Number of Distributions with Student A in Dormitory A:   - Case 1: Dormitory A has 1 student (student A).     - Distribute the remaining 4 students into B and C (each with 2 students): (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways.     - Total for this case: (6).   - Case 2: Dormitory A has 2 students (including student A).     - Choose 1 more student for dormitory A: 4 choices.     - Distribute the remaining 3 students into B and C (one with 1 student and the other with 2):       - Choose which dormitory gets 1 student: 2 choices.       - Choose 1 student for that dormitory: 3 choices.     - Total for this case: (4 times 2 times 3 = 24).   - Total number of distributions with student A in dormitory A: (6 + 24 = 30).3. Number of Distributions without Student A in Dormitory A:   - Subtract the number of distributions with student A in dormitory A from the total distributions: (90 - 30 = 60).Thus, the number of different ways to distribute the students without student A going to dormitory A is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>To solve this, we use the principle of counting by classification.

(1993, Shandong Province Junior High School Mathematics Competition)</div><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum and minimum values of د, which is defined as sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - y²), given that x² + y² = a² and a² &lt; 1. Alright, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem.First, the constraint is x² + y² = a², which is a circle of radius |a| centered at the origin. Since a² &lt; 1, the radius is less than 1. The function we&#39;re trying to maximize and minimize is the sum of two square roots: sqrt(1 - x²) and sqrt(1 - y²). Let me write that down:د = sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - y²)Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum of د given that x² + y² = a².Hmm, so this is an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like substitution or Lagrange multipliers can be useful. Since this is a junior high competition problem, maybe it doesn&#39;t require calculus? Maybe there&#39;s a way to use algebraic manipulations or inequalities?Let me first consider the domain of x and y. Since x² + y² = a² and a² &lt; 1, both |x| and |y| are less than or equal to a, which is less than 1. Therefore, both 1 - x² and 1 - y² are positive, so the square roots are real and defined.Now, let&#39;s think about how د behaves. Since sqrt(1 - x²) is a decreasing function of |x| (as x increases, the value inside the square root decreases), similarly for sqrt(1 - y²). Therefore, intuitively, if we want to maximize د, we might want to minimize |x| and |y|, but they are constrained by x² + y² = a². On the other hand, to minimize د, we might need to maximize |x| or |y|, but they are linked through the equation.Wait, but since x² + y² is fixed, there&#39;s a trade-off between x² and y². If x² is larger, y² must be smaller, and vice versa. So, maybe the maximum of د occurs when x² and y² are as small as possible? But since their sum is fixed, perhaps distributing the &quot;sizes&quot; of x² and y² in some way affects the sum of the square roots.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider symmetry. If x² = y², then x² = y² = a²/2. Then د would be 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2). Is this a maximum or a minimum? Maybe we can compare this with other cases.Suppose, for example, that x is maximum possible, which would be x = a, y = 0. Then د would be sqrt(1 - a²) + sqrt(1 - 0) = sqrt(1 - a²) + 1. Similarly, if y is maximum, y = a, x = 0, then د is the same. Similarly, if x is minimized, but since x² + y² is fixed, the minimum |x| is zero.Wait, so if we set x = 0, then y² = a², so د = sqrt(1 - 0) + sqrt(1 - a²) = 1 + sqrt(1 - a²). Similarly, if y = 0, then د is the same. On the other hand, when x² = y² = a²/2, د = 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2). Let&#39;s compute these two expressions to see which is larger.Compute 1 + sqrt(1 - a²) vs. 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2).Let me square both to compare:(1 + sqrt(1 - a²))² = 1 + 2*sqrt(1 - a²) + (1 - a²) = 2 + 2*sqrt(1 - a²) - a²(2*sqrt(1 - a²/2))² = 4*(1 - a²/2) = 4 - 2a²So, compare 2 + 2*sqrt(1 - a²) - a² vs. 4 - 2a².Subtract 2 from both: 2*sqrt(1 - a²) - a² vs. 2 - 2a²Hmm, 2*sqrt(1 - a²) - a² compared to 2 - 2a².Bring all terms to left side:2*sqrt(1 - a²) - a² - 2 + 2a² = 2*sqrt(1 - a²) + a² - 2So, is 2*sqrt(1 - a²) + a² - 2 positive or negative?Let me compute for a² &lt; 1. Let&#39;s take a specific value, say a² = 0. Then:2*sqrt(1) + 0 - 2 = 2 + 0 - 2 = 0. So, equal.If a² = 1, which is not allowed, but approaching 1:2*sqrt(0) + 1 - 2 = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1, which is less than zero. So, for a² approaching 1, 2*sqrt(1 - a²) + a² - 2 is negative, meaning that 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2) squared is larger than (1 + sqrt(1 - a²)) squared. Therefore, for a² close to 1, 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2) is larger.But at a² = 0, both expressions are 2*1 = 2, and (1 + 1)^2 = 4, but wait, wait, when a² = 0, x² + y² = 0, so x = y = 0. Then د = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1) = 2. So, in that case, both evaluations give 2. So, equality holds at a² = 0. But when a² approaches 1, the case where x and y are equal gives a larger د than when one is 0.Therefore, it seems that when variables are equal, we might have a maximum? Wait, but in the case when a² approaches 1, setting one variable to a and the other to 0 gives د = 1 + sqrt(1 - 1) = 1 + 0 = 1, whereas setting x² = y² = 0.5 gives د = 2*sqrt(1 - 0.5) = 2*sqrt(0.5) ≈ 1.414, which is larger. Therefore, it seems that when variables are spread out equally, the value is higher. So maybe the maximum occurs when x² = y², and the minimum occurs when one variable is 0.Wait, but when a² is small, like a² approaching 0, then setting x=0 gives د = 1 + sqrt(1 - 0) = 2, which is the same as when x and y are both zero. So in that case, both situations give the same value.Wait, but if a² is not zero, but small, say a² = 0.01. Then:If x=0.1, y=0, then د = sqrt(1 - 0.01) + sqrt(1 - 0) = sqrt(0.99) + 1 ≈ 0.99499 + 1 = 1.99499.If x² = y² = 0.005, so x = sqrt(0.005) ≈ 0.0707, y same. Then د = 2*sqrt(1 - 0.005) ≈ 2*sqrt(0.995) ≈ 2*0.99749 ≈ 1.99498. Hmm, so almost the same. So in this case, the maximum is approximately the same, but slightly higher when one variable is 0. Wait, but in this case, the two values are almost the same. So maybe my previous reasoning is not entirely accurate?Wait, but when a² is 0.01, x=0.1, y=0: د ≈ 1.99499.x² = y² = 0.005: د ≈ 1.99498. So actually, setting one variable to a and the other to 0 gives a slightly higher value. So maybe the maximum is achieved when one variable is a and the other is 0? But earlier when a² approaches 1, setting them equal gave a higher value.Wait, when a² approaches 1, x² + y² = 1. If x=1, y=0, then د = sqrt(0) + sqrt(1) = 1. If x and y are sqrt(0.5), then د = 2*sqrt(1 - 0.5) = 2*sqrt(0.5) ≈ 1.414, which is larger. But wait, if a² is approaching 1, but strictly less than 1, then x cannot be 1. So if a² = 0.99, then x can be sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.99499, and y = sqrt(0.01) ≈ 0.1. Then د = sqrt(1 - 0.99) + sqrt(1 - 0.01) = sqrt(0.01) + sqrt(0.99) ≈ 0.1 + 0.99499 ≈ 1.09499. Alternatively, if x² = y² = 0.495, so x ≈ 0.7036, then د = 2*sqrt(1 - 0.495) = 2*sqrt(0.505) ≈ 2*0.7106 ≈ 1.4212. So indeed, when variables are equal, د is larger. So in this case, when a² is close to 1, setting variables equal gives higher د, but when a² is small, setting one variable to maximum gives slightly higher د? Wait, but in the case of a² = 0.01, the difference between setting x=0.1 and x≈0.0707 is minimal, but the maximum is actually slightly higher when x=0.1. Wait, but when a² =0.01, sqrt(1 -0.01) +1 ≈ 1.99499, whereas 2*sqrt(1 -0.005) ≈ 1.99498. So actually, the case when x=0.1 gives a slightly higher د. So perhaps for all a² &lt;1, the maximum is when one variable is a and the other is 0, and the minimum is when x² = y²? But when a² approaches 1, the opposite seems true.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe there&#39;s a critical value of a where the maximum switches from being at the endpoints (x=0 or y=0) to being in the middle (x² = y²). Hmm. This might require calculus.Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize x and y. Since x² + y² = a², we can write x = a cos θ, y = a sin θ, where θ is in [0, 2π). Then د becomes sqrt(1 - a² cos² θ) + sqrt(1 - a² sin² θ). Then we can write د(θ) = sqrt(1 - a² cos² θ) + sqrt(1 - a² sin² θ). To find the maximum and minimum of this function over θ.Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in x and y, we can consider θ in [0, π/4] and extend by symmetry, but maybe not necessary.Alternatively, let&#39;s denote u = cos² θ and v = sin² θ, then u + v = 1. But since x² + y² = a², then u and v are scaled by a². Wait, maybe another substitution.Alternatively, let&#39;s set t = x², then y² = a² - t, so we can write د as sqrt(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - (a² - t)) = sqrt(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a² + t), where t ranges from 0 to a² (since x² can be between 0 and a², because y² = a² - t must be non-negative).Therefore, we can define f(t) = sqrt(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a² + t), with t ∈ [0, a²]. Then we need to find the maximum and minimum of f(t) over t ∈ [0, a²].This might be easier, reducing the problem to a single variable optimization. Let&#39;s try this approach.So f(t) = sqrt(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a² + t)To find the extrema, we can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t, set it to zero, and solve for t.First, compute f&#39;(t):f&#39;(t) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(1 - t)) + (1)/(2*sqrt(1 - a² + t))Set f&#39;(t) = 0:(-1)/(2*sqrt(1 - t)) + (1)/(2*sqrt(1 - a² + t)) = 0Multiply both sides by 2:-1/sqrt(1 - t) + 1/sqrt(1 - a² + t) = 0Therefore:1/sqrt(1 - a² + t) = 1/sqrt(1 - t)Take reciprocals (since both sides are positive):sqrt(1 - a² + t) = sqrt(1 - t)Square both sides:1 - a² + t = 1 - tSimplify:1 - a² + t = 1 - tSubtract 1 from both sides:-a² + t = -tBring t to the left:-a² + 2t = 0Thus:2t = a² =&gt; t = a²/2Therefore, the critical point occurs at t = a²/2. So this suggests that the extremum occurs when t = a²/2, which corresponds to x² = y² = a²/2. Therefore, this is the critical point.Now, we need to check the value of f(t) at t = 0, t = a², and t = a²/2 to determine which is maximum and minimum.Compute f(0) = sqrt(1 - 0) + sqrt(1 - a² + 0) = 1 + sqrt(1 - a²)Compute f(a²) = sqrt(1 - a²) + sqrt(1 - a² + a²) = sqrt(1 - a²) + 1, which is the same as f(0). So f(0) = f(a²)Compute f(a²/2) = sqrt(1 - a²/2) + sqrt(1 - a² + a²/2) = sqrt(1 - a²/2) + sqrt(1 - a²/2) = 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)Now, we need to compare 1 + sqrt(1 - a²) vs. 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2).Earlier, I tried squaring both expressions. Let me do that again more carefully.Let’s let’s compute [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]² = 1 + 2*sqrt(1 - a²) + (1 - a²) = 2 - a² + 2*sqrt(1 - a²)Compute [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² = 4*(1 - a²/2) = 4 - 2a²Now, compare 2 - a² + 2*sqrt(1 - a²) vs. 4 - 2a²Subtract the first expression from the second:(4 - 2a²) - (2 - a² + 2*sqrt(1 - a²)) = 4 - 2a² - 2 + a² - 2*sqrt(1 - a²) = 2 - a² - 2*sqrt(1 - a²)Let’s denote this difference as D = 2 - a² - 2*sqrt(1 - a²)We need to determine if D is positive or negative.Note that D = 2 - a² - 2*sqrt(1 - a²)Let’s factor out 2:D = 2[1 - sqrt(1 - a²)] - a²But maybe instead, let&#39;s substitute s = sqrt(1 - a²), so since a² &lt;1, s ∈ (0,1)Then, D = 2 - (1 - s²) - 2s = 2 -1 + s² - 2s = 1 + s² - 2s = (1 - s)^2Therefore, D = (1 - s)^2 = [1 - sqrt(1 - a²)]², which is always non-negative. Therefore, [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² ≥ [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]², with equality only when D=0, which occurs when 1 - sqrt(1 - a²) =0, i.e., sqrt(1 - a²) =1 =&gt; 1 - a² =1 =&gt; a²=0. So, when a²=0, both expressions are equal. For a² &gt;0, D is positive, so [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² &gt; [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]², hence 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2) &gt; 1 + sqrt(1 - a²).Therefore, the critical point at t = a²/2 gives a larger value than the endpoints. Therefore, the maximum of د is 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2), and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²).Wait, but earlier when a² was approaching 1, this made sense, but when a² was small, like 0.01, I saw numerically that the difference between f(0) and f(a²/2) was very small, but according to this, f(a²/2) should be larger. Let me check again with a²=0.01.Compute 2*sqrt(1 - 0.005) ≈ 2*0.99749 ≈1.99498Compute 1 + sqrt(0.99) ≈1 + 0.99499 ≈1.99499Wait, so actually, f(0) is slightly larger than f(a²/2). But according to the algebra, [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² is greater than [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]². But in this case, 1.99498 vs. 1.99499: f(0) is slightly larger. But according to the squared values, [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² =4 -2a²=4 -0.02=3.98[1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]²= (1 + sqrt(0.99))²≈(1 +0.99499)^2≈(1.99499)^2≈3.97998Wait, 3.98 vs. approx 3.97998. So actually, 4 - 2a² is slightly larger than [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]² when a²=0.01. Hence, 2*sqrt(1 - a²/2) is slightly larger than 1 + sqrt(1 - a²). But when I computed numerically, I saw f(a²/2)=1.99498 vs. f(0)=1.99499. But this can&#39;t be. There must be some error in the calculation.Wait, let me compute precisely.Let a²=0.01.Compute [2*sqrt(1 - a²/2)]² =4*(1 -0.005)=4*0.995=3.98Compute [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]²=(1 + sqrt(0.99))². sqrt(0.99)=approx0.994987437.Hence, 1 +0.994987437≈1.994987437. Squared: approx (1.994987437)^2.Compute 2 squared is 4. Subtract 0.005012563². Wait, (2 - 0.005012563)^2=4 -2*2*0.005012563 + (0.005012563)^2≈4 -0.020050252 +0.000025126≈≈3.97997487But 4*0.995=3.98. So 3.98 vs. approx3.97997487. So 4*0.995 is actually slightly larger. Therefore, sqrt(3.98)≈1.99499373, whereas sqrt(3.97997487)≈1.99498743. So, 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2)≈1.99499373 vs.1 + sqrt(1 -a²)=1.99498743. Therefore, indeed, 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2) is slightly larger. The difference is in the fifth decimal place. So in reality, f(a²/2) is slightly larger than f(0). My previous numerical calculation was mistaken due to rounding errors.Therefore, in all cases where a² &gt;0, the maximum of د is achieved when x² = y² =a²/2, and the minimum is achieved when x or y is 0. So, the maximum value is 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2), and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 -a²).But let me check the derivative&#39;s conclusion. The critical point at t =a²/2 is a maximum or a minimum?Wait, when we found t =a²/2 is a critical point, we need to check if it&#39;s a maximum or minimum. Since the endpoints have the same value, and the critical point is higher than the endpoints (as per previous calculation), then it&#39;s a maximum. Therefore, the function f(t) has maximum at t =a²/2 and minima at t=0 and t=a².Hence, د_max = 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2), and د_min =1 + sqrt(1 -a²).But let me confirm with another test case. Take a² =0.5.Compute د_max =2*sqrt(1 -0.25)=2*sqrt(0.75)=2*(√3/2)=√3≈1.732.Compute د_min=1 + sqrt(1 -0.5)=1 + sqrt(0.5)≈1 +0.707≈1.707.Indeed, 1.732 &gt;1.707, so maximum is higher. So yes, in this case, the critical point is the maximum, endpoints are the minima.Alternatively, take a²=0.25.د_max=2*sqrt(1 -0.125)=2*sqrt(0.875)=2*0.9354≈1.8708د_min=1 + sqrt(0.75)≈1 +0.866≈1.866. So again, maximum is higher.Wait, but here the difference is smaller. 1.8708 vs. 1.866. So the critical point is still higher.Hence, based on the calculus approach, the maximum occurs at t=a²/2 and minimum at t=0 or t=a².Therefore, the answer is:Maximum value is 2*sqrt(1 - (a²)/2)Minimum value is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²)But let me check if there&#39;s another approach, maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz or AM ≥ GM or something.Let me think.We need to maximize and minimize sqrt(1 -x²) + sqrt(1 - y²) with x² + y² =a².Let me denote u = sqrt(1 -x²), v = sqrt(1 - y²). Then, د = u + v.Note that u² + x² =1, v² + y²=1. Therefore, we have:u² + v² +x² + y²=2But x² + y² =a², so u² + v² =2 -a².Therefore, we have u + v to be maximized/minimized given that u² + v² =2 -a².Ah, this is a standard problem: maximize and minimize u + v given that u² + v² = constant.In this case, the constant is 2 -a², and u, v are positive real numbers since x² &lt;1 and y² &lt;1.The maximum of u + v given u² + v² = C is when u = v, i.e., at u = v = sqrt(C/2), so maximum is 2*sqrt(C/2) = sqrt(2C). Similarly, the minimum is when one variable is as large as possible and the other as small as possible. Wait, but given that u and v are both positive and subject to u² + v² = C, the minimum of u + v occurs when one variable is sqrt(C) and the other is 0? Wait, but that would be if we allow one variable to be zero, but in our original problem, u and v are sqrt(1 -x²) and sqrt(1 - y²), and since x² + y² =a² &lt;1, so x² &lt;1 and y² &lt;1, so u and v are both positive. Therefore, the minimum of u + v occurs when one variable is maximized and the other is minimized, but under the constraint u² + v² =2 -a².Wait, but in the problem of minimizing u + v given u² + v² = C, the minimum occurs when one variable is as large as possible and the other as small as possible. However, with u, v &gt;0.But in this case, the minimal value of u + v occurs when one variable is sqrt(C) and the other approaches zero. But in our original variables, this would correspond to x approaches sqrt(1 -C), but need to check.Wait, perhaps this approach can help. Let me clarify.Given u² + v² =2 -a², find the maximum and minimum of u + v.The maximum is sqrt(2*(2 -a²)) by Cauchy-Schwarz: (u + v)² ≤2(u² +v²)=2*(2 -a²), so u +v ≤sqrt(4 -2a²). Wait, but sqrt(4 -2a²)=2*sqrt(1 -a²/2), which matches our previous result for the maximum.For the minimum, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the other direction? Or perhaps use the fact that the minimal value occurs when the variables are as &quot;unequal&quot; as possible. Since u and v are positive, the minimum of u + v given u² +v² =C is achieved when one variable is as large as possible and the other as small as possible.But since u and v are related to x and y through u = sqrt(1 -x²), v = sqrt(1 - y²), and x² + y² =a², when one of x or y is 0, then the other is a. So, if x =a, y=0, then u = sqrt(1 -a²), v =1. Therefore, د=1 + sqrt(1 -a²). Similarly, if y=a, x=0, same result. So in this case, د=1 + sqrt(1 -a²). But according to the previous problem of minimizing u + v with u² +v²=2 -a², does 1 + sqrt(1 -a²) correspond to the minimum?Wait, let&#39;s compute u² +v² in this case. If u=1, v=sqrt(1 -a²), then u² +v²=1 + (1 -a²)=2 -a², which matches. So, in this case, the minimum of u +v is achieved when one variable is 1 and the other is sqrt(1 -a²). Therefore, the minimum is indeed 1 + sqrt(1 -a²), and the maximum is 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2).Hence, this approach via Cauchy-Schwarz also leads to the same conclusion.Therefore, the maximum value of د is 2*sqrt(1 -a²/2), and the minimum value is 1 + sqrt(1 -a²).So, the answer should be:Maximum: 2√(1 - a²/2)Minimum: 1 + √(1 - a²)Expressed in LaTeX:Maximum: boxed{2sqrt{1 - dfrac{a^2}{2}}}Minimum: boxed{1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}}Final AnswerThe maximum value is boxed{2sqrt{1 - dfrac{a^2}{2}}} and the minimum value is boxed{1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of finding the maximum and minimum values of ( د = sqrt{1 - x^2} + sqrt{1 - y^2} ) given ( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 ) with ( a^2 &lt; 1 ):1. Parametrization and Substitution:   - We use the constraint ( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 ) to parametrize ( x ) and ( y ) as ( x = a cos theta ) and ( y = a sin theta ).   - This transforms the function into ( د = sqrt{1 - a^2 cos^2 theta} + sqrt{1 - a^2 sin^2 theta ).2. Single Variable Optimization:   - Substitute ( t = x^2 ), then ( y^2 = a^2 - t ).   - The function becomes ( د = sqrt{1 - t} + sqrt{1 - (a^2 - t)} ).   - This simplifies to ( د = sqrt{1 - t} + sqrt{1 - a^2 + t} ) where ( t in [0, a^2] ).3. Critical Points and Endpoints:   - Find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:     [     f&#39;(t) = frac{-1}{2sqrt{1 - t}} + frac{1}{2sqrt{1 - a^2 + t}} = 0     ]   - Solving this gives ( t = frac{a^2}{2} ), leading to ( x^2 = y^2 = frac{a^2}{2} ).4. Evaluating Extrema:   - Evaluate ( د ) at critical point and endpoints:     - At ( t = frac{a^2}{2} ): ( د = 2sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}} ).     - At endpoints ( t = 0 ) and ( t = a^2 ): ( د = 1 + sqrt{1 - a^2} ).5. Verification Using Inequalities:   - Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the maximum value of ( u + v ) given ( u^2 + v^2 = 2 - a^2 ) is ( sqrt{2(2 - a^2)} = 2sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}} ).   - The minimum value is found when one variable is maximized and the other minimized, leading to ( 1 + sqrt{1 - a^2} ).Final Answer:The maximum value is (boxed{2sqrt{1 - dfrac{a^2}{2}}}) and the minimum value is (boxed{1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the maximum and minimum values of د, which is defined as sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - y²), given that x² + y² = a² where a² &lt; 1. Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem.First, the variables x and y are constrained by the equation x² + y² = a². Since a² is less than 1, this means that both x² and y² are each less than or equal to a², so both |x| and |y| are less than or equal to a, which is less than 1. Therefore, the expressions under the square roots, 1 - x² and 1 - y², are both positive, so we don&#39;t have to worry about taking square roots of negative numbers here.So, د is the sum of two square roots: sqrt(1 - x²) and sqrt(1 - y²). Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum of this sum given the constraint x² + y² = a².Let me think about possible approaches. Since there&#39;s a constraint involving x and y, maybe using Lagrange multipliers could work? But this is a junior high competition problem, so perhaps there&#39;s a simpler method, maybe using trigonometry or algebraic manipulation.Alternatively, since x² + y² = a² is a circle, perhaps we can parameterize x and y in terms of trigonometric functions. Let me try that.Let’s set x = a cos θ and y = a sin θ, since x² + y² = a². Then, substituting into د, we get:د = sqrt(1 - (a cos θ)²) + sqrt(1 - (a sin θ)²)= sqrt(1 - a² cos² θ) + sqrt(1 - a² sin² θ)Hmm, so we need to find the maximum and minimum of this expression with respect to θ. This might be a way to convert the problem into a single-variable calculus problem. Let&#39;s see if we can compute the derivative and find critical points.But before jumping into calculus, maybe there&#39;s a trigonometric identity or inequality that can help simplify this. Let&#39;s consider squaring د to see if that helps:د² = [sqrt(1 - a² cos² θ) + sqrt(1 - a² sin² θ)]²= (1 - a² cos² θ) + (1 - a² sin² θ) + 2 sqrt{(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ)}= 2 - a² (cos² θ + sin² θ) + 2 sqrt{(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ)}= 2 - a² (1) + 2 sqrt{(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ)}= 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ)}So, د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ)}Hmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe we can analyze the product inside the square root. Let&#39;s compute that:(1 - a² cos² θ)(1 - a² sin² θ) = 1 - a² cos² θ - a² sin² θ + a^4 cos² θ sin² θ= 1 - a² (cos² θ + sin² θ) + a^4 cos² θ sin² θ= 1 - a² (1) + a^4 cos² θ sin² θ= 1 - a² + a^4 cos² θ sin² θTherefore, substituting back into د²:د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a² + a^4 cos² θ sin² θ}This is still a bit messy, but maybe we can analyze the term inside the square root. Let&#39;s denote:B = 1 - a² + a^4 cos² θ sin² θSo, we have:د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{B}Now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum and minimum of sqrt{B}, which in turn depends on cos² θ sin² θ. Let&#39;s recall that cos² θ sin² θ can be written as (1/4) sin² 2θ. So:B = 1 - a² + a^4 (1/4) sin² 2θThus, B = 1 - a² + (a^4 / 4) sin² 2θTherefore, B varies between:Minimum when sin² 2θ is minimum (which is 0):B_min = 1 - a²Maximum when sin² 2θ is maximum (which is 1):B_max = 1 - a² + (a^4 / 4)Therefore, sqrt{B} varies between sqrt{1 - a²} and sqrt{1 - a² + a^4 / 4}Therefore, د² varies between:Minimum: 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a²}Maximum: 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a² + a^4 / 4}But we need to check if this actually corresponds to the maximum and minimum of د. Wait, but the relationship between د² and د is monotonic if د is non-negative, which it is here since both square roots are non-negative. Therefore, the maximum of د occurs when د² is maximum, and the minimum of د occurs when د² is minimum.Therefore, the minimum of د is sqrt{2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a²}}? Wait, hold on, no. Wait, wait. Let&#39;s backtrack.Wait, we had:د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{B}Where B is between 1 - a² and 1 - a² + a^4 / 4. Therefore:When B is minimum (1 - a²), then د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a²}When B is maximum (1 - a² + a^4 / 4), then د² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a² + a^4 / 4}Therefore, the minimum value of د² is 2 - a² + 2(1 - a²)^{1/2}And the maximum value is 2 - a² + 2 sqrt{1 - a² + a^4 / 4}But wait, but since د itself is sqrt{1 - x²} + sqrt{1 - y²}, which is a sum of two non-negative terms, perhaps there&#39;s a smarter way to find max and min.Alternatively, maybe we can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-QM or something similar.Alternatively, since x² + y² = a², perhaps we can set variables such that y² = a² - x², so substituting into د, we have:د = sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - (a² - x²)) = sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - a² + x²)So, now د is expressed as a function of x². Let me denote t = x², then t can vary from 0 to a², since x² + y² = a² and x², y² &gt;= 0.Therefore, د(t) = sqrt(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a² + t)Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum of د(t) for t in [0, a²].This is a single-variable function now. Maybe we can compute its derivative with respect to t and find critical points.Let&#39;s compute د&#39;(t):First, let me write د(t) = (1 - t)^{1/2} + (1 - a² + t)^{1/2}Then, derivative is:د’(t) = (-1/2)(1 - t)^{-1/2} + (1/2)(1 - a² + t)^{-1/2}Set derivative equal to zero for critical points:(-1/2)(1 - t)^{-1/2} + (1/2)(1 - a² + t)^{-1/2} = 0Multiply both sides by 2:- (1 - t)^{-1/2} + (1 - a² + t)^{-1/2} = 0Move one term to the other side:(1 - a² + t)^{-1/2} = (1 - t)^{-1/2}Take reciprocals of both sides (since both sides are positive):sqrt(1 - a² + t) = sqrt(1 - t)Square both sides:1 - a² + t = 1 - tSimplify:1 - a² + t = 1 - tSubtract 1 from both sides:-a² + t = -tBring terms together:t + t = a²2t = a²t = a² / 2So, the critical point occurs at t = a² / 2. Since t must be between 0 and a², this critical point is valid.Now, we need to check the value of د(t) at t = 0, t = a², and t = a²/2.Compute د(0):= sqrt(1 - 0) + sqrt(1 - a² + 0) = 1 + sqrt(1 - a²)Compute د(a²):= sqrt(1 - a²) + sqrt(1 - a² + a²) = sqrt(1 - a²) + sqrt(1) = sqrt(1 - a²) + 1Wait, so د(0) and د(a²) are both equal to 1 + sqrt(1 - a²). So, the endpoints give the same value.Compute د(a²/2):= sqrt(1 - a²/2) + sqrt(1 - a² + a²/2)= sqrt(1 - a²/2) + sqrt(1 - a²/2)= 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2)So, at the critical point t = a²/2, د(t) = 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2)Now, to determine whether this critical point is a maximum or a minimum, we can check the second derivative or analyze the behavior.Alternatively, compare the values:Compare 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) with 1 + sqrt(1 - a²)Let me compute both:Let’s denote S = 1 + sqrt(1 - a²)And C = 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2)We need to see which is larger.Compute C² = 4(1 - a²/2) = 4 - 2a²Compute S² = [1 + sqrt(1 - a²)]² = 1 + 2 sqrt(1 - a²) + (1 - a²) = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt(1 - a²)Compare C² and S²:C² = 4 - 2a²S² = 2 - a² + 2 sqrt(1 - a²)We need to see if 4 - 2a² &gt; 2 - a² + 2 sqrt(1 - a²)Simplify:Left side: 4 - 2a²Right side: 2 - a² + 2 sqrt(1 - a²)Subtract right side from left side:4 - 2a² - 2 + a² - 2 sqrt(1 - a²) = 2 - a² - 2 sqrt(1 - a²)Now, let&#39;s see if 2 - a² - 2 sqrt(1 - a²) is positive.Let me denote k = sqrt(1 - a²). Then, since a² &lt; 1, k is between 0 and 1.Then, 2 - a² = 2 - (1 - k²) = 1 + k²So, 2 - a² - 2k = 1 + k² - 2k = (k - 1)^2Which is always non-negative, and equals zero when k = 1, which would require a² = 0.Therefore, 2 - a² - 2 sqrt(1 - a²) = (sqrt(1 - a²) - 1)^2 &gt;= 0Therefore, C² &gt;= S² with equality only when sqrt(1 - a²) = 1, i.e., when a² = 0. But since a² &lt; 1 and presumably a is real, then unless a = 0, this is strictly greater.Thus, C² &gt; S² when a ≠ 0, so C &gt; S. Therefore, the critical point at t = a²/2 gives a larger value than the endpoints.Therefore, the maximum of د is 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2), and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²).But let me verify with a concrete example. Let&#39;s take a specific value of a, say a = 0. Then the constraint is x² + y² = 0, which implies x = y = 0. Then د = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1) = 2. According to the formulas, maximum and minimum would both be 2, since if a=0, then 2 sqrt(1 - 0) = 2 and 1 + sqrt(1 - 0) = 2. So that works.Another example: let a = 1/√2. Then a² = 1/2. Then, maximum would be 2 sqrt(1 - (1/2)/2) = 2 sqrt(1 - 1/4) = 2 sqrt(3/4) = 2*(√3)/2 = √3 ≈ 1.732. The minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - 1/2) = 1 + sqrt(1/2) ≈ 1 + 0.707 ≈ 1.707. Wait, but here the maximum is larger than the minimum, which makes sense.Wait, but according to our previous conclusion, when a is not zero, the maximum is 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²). Let&#39;s check if these are correct.Alternatively, let me take a = 1/2. Then a² = 1/4. Then maximum is 2 sqrt(1 - (1/4)/2) = 2 sqrt(1 - 1/8) = 2 sqrt(7/8) ≈ 2 * 0.935 ≈ 1.87. Minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - 1/4) = 1 + sqrt(3/4) ≈ 1 + 0.866 ≈ 1.866. Wait, so in this case, the maximum is slightly larger than the minimum. But in reality, when a is small, the difference between max and min should be small, perhaps?But let me check with specific x and y. Suppose a = 1/2, and take t = a²/2 = 1/8. Then x² = 1/8, so x = ±1/(2√2), and y² = a² - x² = 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8, so y = ±1/(2√2). Then د = sqrt(1 - 1/8) + sqrt(1 - 1/8) = 2 sqrt(7/8) ≈ 1.87, which matches the maximum. For the minimum, suppose x² = 0, then y² = 1/4, so د = sqrt(1) + sqrt(1 - 1/4) = 1 + sqrt(3/4) ≈ 1.866. So indeed, the maximum is slightly larger than the minimum.But when a approaches 1, say a = 0.9, then a² = 0.81. Then maximum is 2 sqrt(1 - 0.81/2) = 2 sqrt(1 - 0.405) = 2 sqrt(0.595) ≈ 2 * 0.772 ≈ 1.544. Minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - 0.81) = 1 + sqrt(0.19) ≈ 1 + 0.436 ≈ 1.436. So the difference becomes more noticeable as a increases.Therefore, the conclusion is that the maximum of د is 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²).Alternatively, perhaps these expressions can be simplified further.For the maximum, 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) can be written as 2 sqrt{(2 - a²)/2} = 2 * sqrt{(2 - a²)/2} = 2 * [sqrt(2 - a²)/sqrt(2)] ) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 - a²)/sqrt(2))... Wait, no.Wait:sqrt{(2 - a²)/2} = sqrt(2 - a²)/sqrt(2). Then multiplied by 2:2 * sqrt(2 - a²)/sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 - a²) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2 - a²) = sqrt{2(2 - a²)}.Wait, 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) = 2 sqrt{(2 - a²)/2} = sqrt{4*(2 - a²)/2} = sqrt{2*(2 - a²)}. Yes, correct. So 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) = sqrt{2(2 - a²)}. Not sure if that&#39;s simpler, but maybe.Similarly, the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²). Perhaps that&#39;s already simple enough.Therefore, the maximum value is 2 sqrt(1 - a²/2) and the minimum is 1 + sqrt(1 - a²).Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a way to express these in terms of trigonometric identities. Wait, but maybe not necessary. Since the problem is from a competition, they might expect the answers in terms of radicals as we have here.Therefore, the final answer should be:Maximum value: 2√(1 - (a²)/2)Minimum value: 1 + √(1 - a²)But let me check if these are correct with another approach.Alternative approach using symmetry.Suppose we consider x and y such that x² + y² = a². We need to maximize and minimize sqrt(1 - x²) + sqrt(1 - y²).Note that sqrt(1 - x²) is the expression for the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle, but maybe that&#39;s not helpful here.Alternatively, since the function is symmetric in x and y, perhaps the maximum occurs when x = y? Because symmetry often gives extrema in such problems.If x = y, then 2x² = a² =&gt; x² = a² / 2 =&gt; x = y = ±a / sqrt(2). Then, substituting into د:sqrt(1 - a² / 2) + sqrt(1 - a² / 2) = 2 sqrt(1 - a² / 2). So this gives the maximum value we found earlier.For the minimum, perhaps when one variable is as large as possible, and the other is zero. Since x² + y² = a², the maximum value for x² is a², when y² = 0. Then, substituting into د, we get sqrt(1 - a²) + sqrt(1 - 0) = sqrt(1 - a²) + 1, which is the minimum we found. Similarly, if y² is a² and x² is 0, we get the same value.Therefore, this corroborates our earlier results.Therefore, the maximum is achieved when x² = y² = a² / 2, and the minimum is achieved when one variable is ±a and the other is 0.Therefore, the answer should be:Maximum: 2√(1 - a²/2)Minimum: 1 + √(1 - a²)So converting this into boxed notation as per the problem&#39;s instruction.Final AnswerThe maximum value is boxed{2sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}}} and the minimum value is boxed{1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 ) with ( a^2 &lt; 1 ), we need to find the maximum and minimum values of ( sqrt{1 - x^2} + sqrt{1 - y^2} ).First, we parameterize ( x ) and ( y ) using trigonometric functions: ( x = a cos theta ) and ( y = a sin theta ). Substituting these into the expression, we get:[sqrt{1 - (a cos theta)^2} + sqrt{1 - (a sin theta)^2} = sqrt{1 - a^2 cos^2 theta} + sqrt{1 - a^2 sin^2 theta}]To simplify the problem, we consider substituting ( y^2 = a^2 - x^2 ) into the expression, converting it into a single-variable function:[sqrt{1 - x^2} + sqrt{1 - (a^2 - x^2)} = sqrt{1 - x^2} + sqrt{1 - a^2 + x^2}]Let ( t = x^2 ), where ( t ) ranges from 0 to ( a^2 ). The function becomes:[sqrt{1 - t} + sqrt{1 - a^2 + t}]We find the critical points by taking the derivative with respect to ( t ):[frac{d}{dt} left( sqrt{1 - t} + sqrt{1 - a^2 + t} right) = -frac{1}{2sqrt{1 - t}} + frac{1}{2sqrt{1 - a^2 + t}}]Setting the derivative to zero, we solve:[-frac{1}{2sqrt{1 - t}} + frac{1}{2sqrt{1 - a^2 + t}} = 0 implies sqrt{1 - a^2 + t} = sqrt{1 - t}]Squaring both sides, we get:[1 - a^2 + t = 1 - t implies 2t = a^2 implies t = frac{a^2}{2}]Evaluating the function at the critical point and endpoints:- At ( t = frac{a^2}{2} ):  [  sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}} + sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}} = 2sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}}  ]- At ( t = 0 ) and ( t = a^2 ):  [  sqrt{1 - 0} + sqrt{1 - a^2} = 1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}  ]Thus, the maximum value is achieved when ( x^2 = y^2 = frac{a^2}{2} ), and the minimum value is achieved when one variable is ( pm a ) and the other is 0.The maximum value is (boxed{2sqrt{1 - frac{a^2}{2}}}) and the minimum value is (boxed{1 + sqrt{1 - a^2}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>begin{aligned}text { Solution: } s &amp; =sqrt{1-x^{2}}+sqrt{1-y^{2}} &amp; =sqrt{left(sqrt{1-x^{2}}+sqrt{1-y^{2}}right)^{2}} &amp; =sqrt{2-left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)+2 sqrt{1-left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)+x^{2} y^{2}}} . because x^{2} &amp; +y^{2}=a^{2}, therefore s &amp; =sqrt{2-a^{2}+2 sqrt{1-a^{2}+a^{2} x^{2}-x^{4}}} &amp; =sqrt{2-a^{2}+2 sqrt{1-a^{2}+frac{a^{4}}{4}-left(frac{a^{2}}{2}-x^{2}right)^{2}} .}end{aligned}To find the maximum and minimum values of s, we only need to consider the minimum and maximum values of left(frac{a^{2}}{2}-x^{2}right)^{2}.When frac{a^{2}}{2}-x^{2}=0, i.e., x^{2}=frac{a^{2}}{2}, then y^{2}=frac{a^{2}}{2}.

Condition:On the International Space Station, there were electronic clocks displaying time in the format HH : MM. Due to an electromagnetic storm, the device started malfunctioning, and each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. What was the actual time when the storm occurred, if immediately after it the clocks showed 09:09?</div><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the actual time before the electromagnetic storm messed up the clocks on the International Space Station. The clocks showed 09:09 after each digit either increased or decreased by 1. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down.First, the time is displayed in the format HH:MM. Each digit individually either went up by 1 or down by 1. So, each digit we see now (which is 0, 9, 0, 9) is actually the result of a previous digit that was either one more or one less. But since digits can&#39;t go beyond their usual limits (like 0 becoming 9 or something), I need to consider the possible valid digits before the change.Let&#39;s start with the first digit of the hour, which is currently showing 0. The original digit could have been either 0 + 1 = 1 or 0 - 1 = 9 (but since digits are 0-9, 0 -1 would wrap around to 9, right?). Wait, but on a clock, the hours are from 00 to 23. So the first hour digit can be 0, 1, or 2. So if the first digit is now 0, the original could have been 1 (since 0 +1 is not possible because adding 1 to 0 gives 1, but subtracting 1 would be 9, which isn&#39;t valid for the first hour digit). Wait, hold on.Wait, the first digit of the hour can be 0, 1, or 2. If after the storm it&#39;s 0, then the original digit must have been either 1 (since 1 -1 = 0) or 9 (0 +1 = 1, but 0 -1 would be 9, but 9 isn&#39;t a valid first hour digit). So the only possible original digit is 1. Wait, no. Wait, if the original digit was 1, then subtracting 1 would make it 0. If the original digit was 9, adding 1 would make it 0 (since 9 +1 is 10, but that&#39;s two digits). Wait, no, each digit is individual. So if the first digit was 9, adding 1 would make it 0? But in reality, on a digital clock, each digit is separate. So, for example, if the digit is 9, adding 1 would make it 0, and subtracting 1 would make it 8. But in the context of an hour digit, the first digit can&#39;t be 9. So maybe the original digit can&#39;t be 9. So the first digit was either 1 (if it decreased by 1 to become 0) or maybe 0 (if it increased by 1 to become 1, but that would conflict because the current digit is 0). Wait, this is confusing.Let me think again. Each digit after the storm is either original digit +1 or original digit -1. So for the current digit 0, possible original digits are:- Original digit +1 = 0 → original digit = -1 (invalid)- Original digit -1 = 0 → original digit = 1But since digits can&#39;t be negative, the only possibility is original digit = 1. Wait, but maybe wrap-around is allowed? Like, 0 -1 = 9? But in the context of hours, 0 is the first digit, so 0 can&#39;t wrap to 9 because that would make the hour 90-something, which is invalid. Therefore, wrap-around isn&#39;t allowed for the first digit. So the original digit must have been 1. So first digit of the hour is 1.Similarly, the second digit of the hour is currently 9. So original digit could be 8 (if it increased by 1) or 0 (if it decreased by 1, since 9 -1 = 8, but wait, 9 -1 is 8, but maybe wrap-around 9 -1 = 8, but 0? Wait, 9 -1 is 8. So if the current digit is 9, original digit is either 8 or 0. Wait, no, because original digit +1 or -1 equals current digit. So original digit could be 8 (8 +1 =9) or 0 (0 -1 = 9 with wrap-around). But again, considering the hour digits, the second digit can be 0-9, but wrap-around might be allowed here. Wait, but if original digit was 0, decreasing by 1 would make it 9 (if wrap-around is allowed). But in the context of the clock, is wrap-around allowed? Because on a digital clock, typically digits don&#39;t wrap around when they malfunction, but the problem says each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. If the digit was 0 and it decreased by 1, then it becomes 9. Similarly, if it was 9 and increased by 1, it becomes 0. So the problem might allow wrap-around. So the second hour digit is 9. So original digit could be 8 (if it increased) or 0 (if it decreased). So possible original digits: 8 or 0.Similarly, the first minute digit is 0, so original digit is 1 (if it decreased by 1) or 9 (if it increased by 1). But again, 9 is possible here because minute digits can be 0-5? Wait, no. Wait, minutes are from 00 to 59, so the first minute digit can be 0-5. So if the original first minute digit was 9, that would be invalid. Therefore, original first minute digit must have been 1 (since 1 -1 =0). Because 9 is not a valid first minute digit (since minutes can&#39;t be 90-99). So original first minute digit is 1.The second minute digit is 9. So original digit could be 8 or 0. But again, minutes can be 0-59, so the second minute digit can be 0-9. So 8 is valid (if original digit was 8, increased to 9) or 0 (original digit was 0, decreased to 9). So possible original digits: 8 or 0.Putting this together:First hour digit: must be 1 (since 0 can&#39;t wrap to 9 because first hour digit can&#39;t be 9)Second hour digit: 8 or 0First minute digit: 1 (since 9 is invalid)Second minute digit: 8 or 0So possible original times:1 (8 or 0) : 1 (8 or 0)But hours can be from 00 to 23. So first hour digit is 1, so possible hours are 10-19. Wait, but if the original first hour digit was 1, then the original hour is 1X, where X is the second digit. But wait, after the storm, the first digit is 0. Wait, no. Wait, the original first hour digit was 1, and then it decreased by 1 to become 0. So original hour was 1X, and after decreasing the first digit by 1, it becomes 0X. But the original hour would be 10-19, but after the storm, it&#39;s 00-09? Wait, no, the entire hour would be 0 followed by the second digit. Wait, but if the original first digit was 1, decreasing by 1 makes it 0. Then the second digit is either 8 or 0. So original hour could be 18 or 10. Then after the storm, the first digit becomes 0, and the second digit becomes 9 (if original was 8, which became 9) or 0 (if original was 0, which became 9? Wait, no. Wait, let&#39;s be precise.Original first hour digit: 1 (since it decreased by 1 to become 0)Original second hour digit: let&#39;s say original digit was A, then A +/-1 = current digit (9). So A could be 8 or 0. So original second hour digit is 8 or 0.Therefore, original hour is 18 or 10.Then, original minutes:First minute digit: 1 (since it decreased by 1 to 0)Second minute digit: original digit could be 8 or 0 (since 8 +1 =9 or 0 -1 =9)Therefore, original minutes are 18 or 10.But original minutes must be between 00 and 59. So 18 is okay, 10 is okay. Wait, original minutes would be 1 followed by 8 or 0. So 18 or 10. So possible original times:18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10.Wait, but wait, original hour is either 18 or 10. Original minutes are either 18 or 10. So combinations are:18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10.But we need to check if these times, when each digit is changed by +/-1, result in 09:09.Let&#39;s check each possibility.First candidate: 18:18.First hour digit: 1 -&gt; 1 -1 =0 (correct)Second hour digit: 8 -&gt; 8 +1 =9 (correct)First minute digit: 1 -&gt;1 -1 =0 (correct)Second minute digit:8 -&gt;8 +1=9 (correct)So 18:18 becomes 09:09. This works.Second candidate:18:10.First hour digit:1 -&gt;0 (correct)Second hour digit:8-&gt;9 (correct)First minute digit:1-&gt;0 (correct)Second minute digit:0 -&gt;0 -1=9 (with wrap-around). But does the problem allow wrap-around? If so, 0 -1 =9, so yes. So 18:10 becomes 09:09. This also works.Third candidate:10:18.First hour digit:1-&gt;0 (correct)Second hour digit:0-&gt;0 -1=9 (with wrap-around). But original hour is 10. After changing first digit from 1 to 0, and second digit from 0 to 9, the hour becomes 09. Then minutes:1-&gt;0 (correct), 8-&gt;9 (correct). So 10:18 becomes 09:09. This works.Fourth candidate:10:10.First hour digit:1-&gt;0 (correct)Second hour digit:0-&gt;9 (wrap-around)First minute digit:1-&gt;0 (correct)Second minute digit:0-&gt;9 (wrap-around). So 10:10 becomes 09:09. This works.Wait, so all four possibilities are valid? But that&#39;s conflicting. How can there be multiple possible original times?Wait, but the problem states &quot;What was the actual time when the storm occurred&quot;. So maybe there&#39;s only one correct answer. But according to this, there are four possibilities. But maybe some of these times are invalid because of wrap-around not being allowed for certain digits.Wait, let&#39;s check the hour digits. Original hour 10: the second hour digit is 0. If that 0 is decreased by 1 to become 9, but does the problem allow wrap-around? The problem states each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. If a digit is 0 and it&#39;s decreased by 1, does it wrap to 9? If yes, then 10 is a possible original hour. If not, then 0 decreased by 1 would be invalid, so original second digit can&#39;t be 0. Similarly for the minutes.But the problem says &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;. It doesn&#39;t specify whether it wraps around or just stops at 0 or 9. This is ambiguous. If we assume that decreasing 0 gives 9 and increasing 9 gives 0, then wrap-around is allowed, so all four possibilities are valid. But maybe the problem expects wrap-around is allowed, so all four are possible. But that would mean there are multiple correct answers, which is not typical for such problems. So perhaps I made a mistake.Wait, but the problem is from a competition or something, where there&#39;s a unique answer. So maybe there is only one possible time that is valid in all digits without needing to wrap around? Let&#39;s check.Original time candidates:18:18: all digits are within 1-8, so decreasing or increasing doesn&#39;t require wrap-around except for the second hour digit (8 -&gt;9 is allowed by increasing, and the second minute digit (8-&gt;9). No wrap-around needed here except maybe for the 8s turning into 9s. But 8+1=9 is allowed. So no wrap-around except if a digit was 0.18:10: original second minute digit is 0. If it was decreased by 1 to become 9, that&#39;s a wrap-around. So that requires wrap-around. Similarly, 10:18 has the original second hour digit 0, which was decreased to 9 (wrap-around). And 10:10 has both 0s being decreased to 9s. So maybe the problem doesn&#39;t allow wrap-around? If wrap-around isn&#39;t allowed, then decreasing 0 would stay at 0 or be invalid, but the problem says each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. So if you decrease 0, you get -1, which is invalid, so the only possibility is that the digit was increased. Wait, but that contradicts. Hmmm.Wait, maybe the problem assumes that when you decrease a digit by 1, it can&#39;t go below 0, and when you increase, it can&#39;t go above 9. But in that case, if a digit is 0, it can only be increased by 1 (to 1), not decreased. Similarly, a digit 9 can only be decreased by 1 (to 8), not increased. So in that case, let&#39;s re-examine the digits.If digits can&#39;t wrap around, then:Current first hour digit: 0. Possible original digits: only 1 (since 0 can&#39;t be decreased, so original digit must be 0 +1 =1, but wait, original digit +1=0? No, wait. Wait, if the current digit is 0, then the original digit must have been 0 +1=1 (if the original digit was increased to 0? Wait, no. Wait, confusion here.Wait, the current digit is the result of original digit +/-1. So if current digit is 0, original digit could be 1 (if original was 1 and decreased by 1) or 9 (if original was 9 and increased by 1). But if we can&#39;t wrap around, then original digit can&#39;t be 9 because increasing 9 would go to 10, which is invalid. Wait, but each digit is individual. So if it&#39;s a single digit, 9 increased by 1 would be 0 (if wrap-around is allowed). But if wrap-around is not allowed, then 9 can&#39;t be increased. So, assuming wrap-around is not allowed, then:For current digit 0:Original digit must have been 1 (since 1 -1 =0). 9 is invalid because 9 +1 would be 10, which is not a single digit. Wait, but how is the operation defined? If it&#39;s modulo 10, then 9 +1 =0. If it&#39;s not, then 9 +1 is invalid. The problem statement says &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;. It doesn&#39;t mention wrapping, so maybe we should assume that digits cannot wrap around. Therefore, if a digit is 0, it can&#39;t be decreased (since that would go to -1), and if it&#39;s 9, it can&#39;t be increased (since that would go to 10). Therefore:For current digit 0, possible original digits: only 1 (since original digit decreased by 1).For current digit 9, possible original digits: only 8 (original digit increased by 1).Similarly, current digit 1: original could be 0 or 2.But in our problem, the current digits are 0,9,0,9.So applying this:First hour digit (current 0): original must be 1.Second hour digit (current 9): original must be 8.First minute digit (current 0): original must be 1.Second minute digit (current 9): original must be 8.Therefore, the only possible original time is 18:18.Because:Original first hour digit:1 (1-1=0)Original second hour digit:8 (8+1=9)Original first minute digit:1 (1-1=0)Original second minute digit:8 (8+1=9)So 18:18 becomes 09:09 when each digit is changed accordingly. This doesn&#39;t require any wrapping, so no digits go below 0 or above 9. Therefore, this must be the correct answer.But wait, why did I earlier think there were four possibilities? Because I considered wrap-around. If the problem allows wrap-around, there are four possibilities. But if it doesn&#39;t, only one. So the key is whether the problem allows digits to wrap around. The problem statement says &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;. Since it&#39;s a digital clock, each digit is a separate segment display. So, for example, if a digit is 9 and it increases by 1, it would become 0 (as in a seven-segment display rolling over). Similarly, 0 decreased by 1 would become 9. Therefore, it&#39;s likely that wrap-around is allowed.However, in the context of hours and minutes on the ISS, which uses a 24-hour format from 00:00 to 23:59, certain wrap-arounds would result in invalid times. For example, if the original hour was 23 and a digit increases, it might become 34, which is invalid, but the problem states that after the storm, the clock showed 09:09, which is valid. So the original time must have been such that after each digit is changed, the result is a valid time. However, the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about invalid times being displayed, so it&#39;s possible that the clock can display any combination, even if it&#39;s not a valid time. But the result is 09:09, which is valid.But to find the original time, we need to consider all possibilities where each digit is changed by +/-1 (with wrap-around), leading to 09:09. However, since the ISS uses 24-hour time, the original hour must be a valid hour (00-23). So even if wrap-around is allowed for digits, the original hour must be valid.So let&#39;s re-examine the four possibilities:1. 18:18 → valid, becomes 09:092. 18:10 → valid, becomes 09:09 (with minute digit 0→9 via wrap-around)3. 10:18 → valid, becomes 09:09 (with hour digit 0→9 via wrap-around)4. 10:10 → valid, becomes 09:09 (both 0→9 in hour and minute)But original hours:- 18 and 10 are both valid (18:00 is 6 PM, 10:00 is 10 AM).Original minutes:- 18 and 10 are both valid (18 minutes and 10 minutes).So all four original times are valid. But the problem asks &quot;What was the actual time&quot;, implying a unique answer. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my reasoning.Wait, but maybe the ISS uses a 24-hour format where the hour is from 00 to 23. So let&#39;s check the original hours:1. 18: valid2. 18: valid3. 10: valid4. 10: validAll are valid. Original minutes:1. 18: valid2. 10: valid3. 18: valid4. 10: validSo all four are possible. But the problem states &quot;the clocks showed 09:09&quot; after the storm. Is there any way to determine which of the four is the actual time?Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a unique solution if we consider that each digit was either increased or decreased, but not a mix. Wait, no, each digit individually could have been increased or decreased. The problem doesn&#39;t state that all digits were increased or all decreased. Each digit independently changed.But if all four are possible, then the answer is not unique. However, the problem seems to expect a single answer. Maybe I missed something.Wait, let&#39;s check each original time:1. 18:18After changing each digit: first hour 1→0 (decrease), second hour 8→9 (increase), first minute 1→0 (decrease), second minute 8→9 (increase). So two increases and two decreases.2. 18:10After changing: 1→0 (decrease), 8→9 (increase), 1→0 (decrease), 0→9 (decrease). Wait, 0→9 is a decrease (since 0-1=9). So three decreases and one increase.3. 10:18After changing: 1→0 (decrease), 0→9 (decrease), 1→0 (decrease), 8→9 (increase). So three decreases and one increase.4. 10:10After changing: 1→0 (decrease), 0→9 (decrease), 1→0 (decrease), 0→9 (decrease). Four decreases.All these scenarios are possible since each digit is changed independently. So all four original times are possible. However, the problem asks for &quot;the actual time&quot;. Maybe there&#39;s a convention or something else.Wait, perhaps the problem comes from a culture or context where 24-hour time is used, but leading zeros are not used. For example, maybe 18:18 is written as 18:18, but 10:10 is written as 10:10, both valid. I don&#39;t see how that would affect it.Alternatively, maybe the electronic clocks on the ISS display hours as two digits always, so 00 to 23. All original times are within this.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in considering wrap-around for the first digit of the hour. For example, if the first digit of the hour is 0, and it was decreased by 1 to become 9, but 9 is not a valid first digit for the hour (since hours go up to 23). Therefore, if wrap-around is not allowed for the first digit of the hour, then certain possibilities are invalid.For example, in the original time 10:10, changing the second hour digit from 0 to 9 would make the hour 09, which is valid. But changing the first hour digit from 1 to 0 is allowed. However, if the original hour is 10, and we change the second digit from 0 to 9 via decreasing (0-1=9), but since the first digit is 1, the hour becomes 09, which is valid. So it&#39;s allowed.Wait, but if the original hour was 10, and we decrease the second digit from 0 to 9, making it 19? Wait, no. Wait, original hour is 10. The first digit is 1, which decreases to 0. The second digit is 0, which decreases to 9. So the new hour is 09. That&#39;s valid. So even though 09 is a valid hour, the original hour was 10.But the problem doesn&#39;t restrict the original time&#39;s validity beyond what&#39;s necessary to produce the displayed time. So all four are possible.But since the problem is presented as having a unique answer, likely I made a mistake in considering wrap-around. Maybe the problem does not allow wrap-around, so the only possible original time is 18:18.If wrap-around is not allowed, then:Current first hour digit 0: original must be 1 (1-1=0).Current second hour digit 9: original must be 8 (8+1=9).Current first minute digit 0: original must be 1 (1-1=0).Current second minute digit 9: original must be 8 (8+1=9).Therefore, the original time is 18:18.This doesn&#39;t require any wrapping, so it&#39;s the only valid answer if wrap-around is disallowed. Since the problem might be intended for no wrap-around, this is likely the expected answer.Alternatively, in some contexts, decreasing a digit below 0 or increasing above 9 results in an invalid digit, so those changes are not possible. Therefore, the only valid original time is 18:18.So I think the answer is 18:18.&lt;/think&gt;The actual time before the malfunction was 18:18. Each digit of 18:18 either increased or decreased by 1 to result in 09:09:- First hour digit (1 → 0): Decreased by 1.- Second hour digit (8 → 9): Increased by 1.- First minute digit (1 → 0): Decreased by 1.- Second minute digit (8 → 9): Increased by 1.All changes respect valid digit ranges without requiring wrap-around. Thus, the original time is boxed{18:18}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so there&#39;s this problem about the International Space Station&#39;s clocks malfunctioning due to an electromagnetic storm. The clocks were showing 09:09 after the storm, but each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. I need to figure out what the actual time was before the malfunction. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, the clock displays time in the format HH:MM. Each digit is affected individually—either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. So, for each digit in 09:09, I have to consider both possibilities (up or down) and see what original digits could have been there.Let me write down the digits of the displayed time after the storm: 0, 9, :, 0, 9. Wait, the colon is just a separator, so maybe only the numbers matter. So the digits are H1, H2, M1, M2. The original digits would have been each either +1 or -1 from the displayed digits. But since digits can only be 0-9, we have to make sure that when we add or subtract 1, the original digit is still a valid digit (i.e., between 0 and 9). Also, the original time has to be a valid time, so hours can&#39;t be more than 23, and minutes can&#39;t be more than 59.Let me start with the first digit of the hour, which is 0. If the malfunction caused this digit to either increase by 1 or decrease by 1, then the original digit could be:0 + 1 = 1, or 0 - 1 = 9 (since 0 -1 would wrap around, but maybe the digit just goes to 9? Wait, but digits are physical displays, like seven-segment displays. If a digit is 0, and it malfunctions by each segment either increasing or decreasing by 1, would that mean the digit changes to 9 or 1? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of what a seven-segment display would look like if each segment is either on or off. Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The problem says each digit either increases by 1 or decreases by 1. So, if the digit was originally x, after malfunction it&#39;s x+1 or x-1. But since the clock is digital, each digit is a single digit, so 0 decreasing by 1 would wrap to 9, and 9 increasing by 1 would wrap to 0? Wait, but the problem says &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1.&quot; So maybe it&#39;s not considering modulo 10, but just the actual digit. If the original digit was 1, then decreasing by 1 would result in 0, and increasing by 1 would result in 2. Similarly, if the original digit was 9, decreasing by 1 would be 8, increasing by 1 would be 0 (assuming it wraps around). Wait, but is that how digital clocks work? If you have a 9 and you increase it by 1, it becomes 0, right? But the problem says each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1. So, if the displayed digit is 9, the original digit could be 8 (if 9 was obtained by increasing 8 by 1) or 0 (if 9 was obtained by decreasing 0 by 1, which would wrap around). Similarly, if the displayed digit is 0, the original digit could be 1 (if 0 was obtained by decreasing 1 by 1) or 9 (if 0 was obtained by increasing 9 by 1). Wait, but does a digit increasing 9 by 1 wrap to 0, or is it impossible? The problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the digits can wrap around or not. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe we need to assume that when a digit is increased or decreased, it&#39;s done modulo 10. So, 0 decreased by 1 is 9, and 9 increased by 1 is 0. That seems like a reasonable assumption, especially in the context of digital clocks where the digits cycle.Okay, so assuming modulo 10 arithmetic, each displayed digit is either the original digit +1 or -1 modulo 10. So, for each digit in 09:09, the original digit could be (digit -1) mod 10 or (digit +1) mod 10. Then, the original time is some combination of these possibilities for each digit.Let me list the possibilities for each digit:First hour digit (displayed as 0): original could be (0 -1)=9 or (0 +1)=1Second hour digit (displayed as 9): original could be (9 -1)=8 or (9 +1)=0First minute digit (displayed as 0): original could be 9 or 1Second minute digit (displayed as 9): original could be 8 or 0So, the original time would be H1 H2 : M1 M2, where:H1 ∈ {9, 1}H2 ∈ {8, 0}M1 ∈ {9, 1}M2 ∈ {8, 0}But we need to ensure that the original time is a valid time. So, the hours (H1H2) must be between 00 and 23, and the minutes (M1M2) must be between 00 and 59.Let&#39;s first consider the hours. H1 can be 9 or 1, and H2 can be 8 or 0.So possible hour combinations:H1=9, H2=8 → 98: Not valid (max hour is 23)H1=9, H2=0 → 90: Not validH1=1, H2=8 → 18: Valid (since 18 is 6 PM, which is a valid 24-hour time)H1=1, H2=0 → 10: ValidSo the possible original hours are 18 or 10.Now, the minutes. M1 can be 9 or 1, and M2 can be 8 or 0.Possible minute combinations:M1=9, M2=8 → 98: Invalid (max minute is 59)M1=9, M2=0 → 90: InvalidM1=1, M2=8 → 18: ValidM1=1, M2=0 → 10: ValidSo the possible original minutes are 18 or 10.Therefore, combining hours and minutes:Possible original times are:18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10But we need to check if each of these times, when each digit is either increased or decreased by 1, results in 09:09.Wait, let me verify each possibility.First, take 18:18.Each digit:H1=1 → can become 0 or 2H2=8 → can become 7 or 9M1=1 → can become 0 or 2M2=8 → can become 7 or 9But the result after malfunction is 09:09. So:For H1: original 1 becomes 0 (if decreased) or 2 (if increased). But the displayed H1 is 0, so only possible if original H1 was 1 (decreased by 1). So that&#39;s okay.H2: original 8 becomes 7 or 9. The displayed H2 is 9, so original H2 must have been 8 (increased by 1). Okay.M1: original 1 becomes 0 or 2. Displayed M1 is 0, so original M1 must have been 1 (decreased by 1).M2: original 8 becomes 7 or 9. Displayed M2 is 9, so original M2 must have been 8 (increased by 1). So 18:18 is possible, as all digits can transition to 09:09 by appropriate +/-1.Next, 18:10.Original time 18:10.H1=1: same as before, becomes 0 or 2. Needs to become 0, so okay.H2=8: becomes 7 or 9. Needs to become 9, okay.M1=1: becomes 0 or 2. Displayed M1 is 0, so okay.M2=0: becomes 9 (if decreased) or 1 (if increased). But the displayed M2 is 9. So original M2 must have been 0 (decreased by 1 to 9). Wait, but M2 in original is 0. So 0 decreased by 1 is 9, yes. So M2=0 becomes 9. So that works. So 18:10 could also be a possibility.Wait, but let&#39;s check: original minutes 10. So M1=1, M2=0. Then after malfunction:M1=1 can become 0 or 2. It becomes 0 (as displayed), so that&#39;s okay.M2=0 can become 9 or 1. It becomes 9 (as displayed), so that&#39;s okay. So 18:10 is possible.Next, 10:18.Original time 10:18.H1=1: becomes 0 or 2. Displayed H1=0, so original H1=1 (decreased by 1).H2=0: becomes 9 or 1. Displayed H2=9, so original H2=0 (decreased by 1 to 9). Wait, H2 in original is 0. So 0 decreased by 1 is 9. So H2=0 becomes 9. That&#39;s okay.M1=1: becomes 0 or 2. Displayed M1=0, so okay.M2=8: becomes 7 or 9. Displayed M2=9, so original M2=8 (increased by 1). Okay. So 10:18 is possible.Now, 10:10.Original time 10:10.H1=1: becomes 0 or 2. Displayed 0, so okay.H2=0: becomes 9 or 1. Displayed 9, so original H2=0 (decreased by 1). Okay.M1=1: becomes 0 or 2. Displayed 0, so okay.M2=0: becomes 9 or 1. Displayed 9, so original M2=0 (decreased by 1). Okay. So 10:10 is possible.Therefore, all four combinations (18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10) are possible original times that could have been displayed as 09:09 after each digit is either increased or decreased by 1. But wait, the problem is asking for &quot;the actual time&quot;—singular. So maybe there&#39;s a unique solution. But according to this, there are four possibilities. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.Wait, maybe there&#39;s an assumption that the storm occurred at a specific time, and perhaps some of these times are not valid in terms of the space station&#39;s operation? Or maybe there&#39;s another constraint I&#39;m missing.Wait, let&#39;s check each possible original time and see if all digits can indeed transition to 09:09 through either +1 or -1. For each original time, we have to check each digit&#39;s possible transition.Take 18:18:Original digits: 1,8,1,8After malfunction: 0,9,0,9So:1 → 0 (decrease by 1)8 → 9 (increase by 1)1 → 0 (decrease by 1)8 → 9 (increase by 1)Yes, that works.18:10:Original digits:1,8,1,0After malfunction:0,9,0,91→0 (decrease)8→9 (increase)1→0 (decrease)0→9 (decrease)Yes, that&#39;s possible.10:18:Original digits:1,0,1,8After malfunction:0,9,0,91→0 (decrease)0→9 (decrease)1→0 (decrease)8→9 (increase)Yes.10:10:Original digits:1,0,1,0After malfunction:0,9,0,91→0 (decrease)0→9 (decrease)1→0 (decrease)0→9 (decrease)Yes, that works.So all four times are possible. But the problem states &quot;What was the actual time when the storm occurred?&quot; implying a unique answer. So maybe there&#39;s something wrong with my approach. Let me re-examine.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s an issue with the hour constraints. For example, 18:18 and 10:10 are both valid times. Similarly, 18:10 and 10:18. But maybe in the context of the International Space Station, the time is referenced in UTC or some specific time zone, but the problem doesn&#39;t mention that. So maybe the answer is multiple possible times, but the problem expects a single answer.Wait, let me check the problem statement again: &quot;What was the actual time when the storm occurred, if immediately after it the clocks showed 09:09?&quot; It says &quot;the actual time&quot;—singular. So perhaps only one of these possibilities is valid. But according to my analysis, four are possible. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the transitions.Wait, let&#39;s check again. For example, let&#39;s take the original time 10:10. Each digit would have to be decreased by 1 to get 09:09. So:H1:1 →0 (decrease)H2:0 →9 (decrease)M1:1 →0 (decrease)M2:0 →9 (decrease)But decreasing 0 by 1 would be 9, which is allowed. So that works.But maybe the problem expects that each digit either increases or decreases, but not all decreasing. However, the problem states that &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1.&quot; There&#39;s no restriction that some digits must increase and others must decrease. So all digits could potentially increase or all decrease. So 10:10 is a valid original time where all digits were decreased by 1.Similarly, in 18:18, some digits increased and some decreased. So all four times are possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has multiple correct answers, but the answer format expects a single boxed answer. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I need to consider something else.Wait, another thought: on a digital clock, the hour digits can only go up to 23, and minutes up to 59. But when considering the original time, are there other constraints? For example, in 18:18, the original minutes are 18, which is valid. 10:10 is also valid. 18:10 and 10:18 are both valid times.Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the transition for each digit is either all increasing or all decreasing. But the problem states &quot;each digit... either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;—independently. So each digit can choose to increase or decrease independently. So the four possibilities are all valid.But the problem is in Chinese, perhaps, and the original might have a unique answer. Wait, no, the user provided the problem in English. So maybe the answer expects multiple possibilities, but the user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, which usually indicates a single answer. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the original digits. Let&#39;s re-examine each digit:For the first hour digit (displayed as 0): possible originals are 9 or 1. But if H1 is 9, then the hour would be 98 or 90, which are invalid. So H1 must be 1, leading to hours 18 or 10. So that&#39;s correct.For the second hour digit (displayed as 9): originals are 8 or 0. So if H2 is 8, then hours are 18 or 98 (invalid). If H2 is 0, hours are 10 or 90 (invalid). So H2 must be 8 or 0, leading to valid hours 18 and 10.Similarly for minutes: M1 is 9 or 1. If M1 is 9, minutes would be 98 or 90 (invalid). So M1 must be 1, leading to minutes 18 or 10. Wait a minute! Wait, in the minutes, if the first minute digit M1 is displayed as 0, original could be 9 or 1. But minutes can only be 00-59. So if original M1 is 9, then the minutes would be 9x, which can be up to 99, but minutes can only go up to 59. So original M1 can&#39;t be 9 because that would make minutes 9x, which is invalid. Wait, this is a critical point I missed earlier.Ah! Yes, in the minutes, the first digit (M1) after malfunction is 0. Original M1 could be 9 or 1. But if original M1 is 9, then original minutes would be 9x, which is invalid because minutes can&#39;t exceed 59. Therefore, original M1 cannot be 9, so must be 1. Therefore, M1 must be 1. Similarly, for M2: original could be 8 or 0. But if original M2 is 8, then the minutes would be x8, which is valid if x is 1 (18) or 5 (58), etc. Wait, but original M1 is 1 (as established), so minutes would be 1x. If original M2 is 8, then minutes would be 18; if original M2 is 0, then minutes would be 10. Both 18 and 10 are valid minutes. Therefore, M1 must be 1, and M2 can be 8 or 0. So possible minutes are 18 or 10.Similarly, for the hours: original H1 must be 1 (since H1=9 would lead to invalid hours), so hours are either 18 or 10.Therefore, combining these, the possible original times are 18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10. But wait, earlier I considered that M1 could be 9, but that&#39;s invalid. So M1 must be 1. Therefore, the original minutes must start with 1, leading to 18 or 10 minutes. So minutes can only be 18 or 10. Therefore, the original times are:18:18, 18:10, 10:18, 10:10.But now, considering the first hour digit: H1=1, so hours are 18 or 10. So all four combinations are possible.But the problem is asking for the actual time, implying one answer. Maybe in the problem&#39;s context, there&#39;s only one possible time that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 10:10, considering that all digits are decreased by 1. But the problem allows each digit to be individually increased or decreased. So unless there&#39;s more context, all four are possible. However, in typical puzzles like this, sometimes the intended answer is the one where each digit is changed in the same direction. For example, all digits decreased by 1: original time 10:10, which becomes 09:09 when each digit is decreased by 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the storm caused each digit to either increase or decrease, but not a mix. Wait, but the problem says &quot;each digit... either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;—so each digit individually. So a mix is allowed.But maybe the actual time is 10:10, because if you decrease each digit by 1, you get 09:09. Similarly, if you increase each digit by 1, you would get 21:21 becomes 32:32, which is invalid. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a unique solution when considering that the storm caused the digits to change, and the ISS is in a specific time zone where only one of the options makes sense. But without additional information, it&#39;s hard to say.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s an error in considering the original hours. Let me re-examine the hours:Original hours possibilities are 18 or 10.For 18: H1=1, H2=8. To become 09, H1=1 must decrease to 0, and H2=8 must increase to 9.For 10: H1=1 must decrease to 0, and H2=0 must decrease to 9.Wait, H2=0 decreasing by 1 to 9. So for 10 -&gt; 09, H1:1-&gt;0 (decrease), H2:0-&gt;9 (decrease). So that&#39;s possible.So both 18 and 10 are possible hours. But the problem is asking for the actual time. Maybe there&#39;s a trick here. Let&#39;s think about the minutes again. Original minutes must be either 18 or 10. So if original minutes are 18, then M1=1, M2=8. To become 09, M1=1 must decrease to 0, M2=8 must increase to 9. If original minutes are 10, then M1=1 must decrease to 0, M2=0 must decrease to 9.So both are possible. So all four combinations are possible.But the problem likely expects a single answer. Maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s think: what time, when each digit is either +1 or -1, results in 09:09. Maybe there&#39;s only one valid time where all transitions are possible without invalid digits.Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, four possibilities are valid. Unless the problem considers that when a digit is 0, decreasing by 1 is not possible (i.e., the digit can&#39;t go below 0). Similarly, if a digit is 9, increasing by 1 is not possible (i.e., can&#39;t go above 9). But the problem statement says &quot;each digit on the display either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;. If we take that literally, without wrapping, then:For example, if a digit is 0, decreasing by 1 would be impossible (since you can&#39;t have -1), so the only possibility is increasing by 1 to 1. Similarly, if a digit is 9, increasing by 1 would be impossible, so the only possibility is decreasing by 1 to 8. But this contradicts the problem&#39;s statement that each digit either increased or decreased by 1. If a digit can&#39;t be increased or decreased (like 0 can&#39;t be decreased), then the only possibility is the other operation. But the problem says each digit either increased or decreased. So if a digit is 0, then it must have been increased by 1 from 9 (since decreasing 0 is impossible). Wait, this is a different interpretation. Let me clarify.If we assume that when the storm occurred, each digit changed by either +1 or -1, but if the digit was at the boundary (like 0), decreasing it further is impossible, so it must have been increased. But that would mean that if the displayed digit is 0, the original digit must have been 1 (since decreasing 0 is impossible). Similarly, if the displayed digit is 9, the original must have been 8 (since increasing 9 is impossible). This would eliminate the wrap-around assumption.Let me re-examine this possibility. If we assume that digits cannot wrap around, then:- If a displayed digit is 0, it could only have come from a digit that was increased by 1 (original digit 1) or decreased by 1, but decreasing 0 is impossible. So original digit must have been 1.- If a displayed digit is 9, it could only have come from a digit that was decreased by 1 (original digit 8), since increasing 9 is impossible. So original digit must have been 8.Similarly, for other digits:- Displayed digit 1: original could be 0 (increased by 1) or 2 (decreased by 1).Wait, but if we disallow wrapping, then:- For any digit d (0-9), the possible original digits are:  - If d is 0: original can only be 1 (since 0-1 is invalid)  - If d is 9: original can only be 8 (since 9+1 is invalid)  - Otherwise, original can be d-1 or d+1If that&#39;s the case, then the original digits can be uniquely determined for 0 and 9, but for others, there are two possibilities.But in the problem, the displayed time after the storm is 09:09. So let&#39;s apply this non-wrapping logic:First hour digit: displayed 0. Since 0 cannot be decreased, it must have been increased from 1. So original H1=1.Second hour digit: displayed 9. Since 9 cannot be increased, it must have been decreased from 8. So original H2=8.First minute digit: displayed 0. Similarly, original M1=1.Second minute digit: displayed 9. Original M2=8.Therefore, original time is 18:18.Because:H1=1 (from 0 being increased from 1)H2=8 (from 9 being decreased from 8)M1=1 (from 0 being increased from 1)M2=8 (from 9 being decreased from 8)Therefore, original time is 18:18.In this case, the answer is uniquely 18:18, assuming that digits cannot wrap around (i.e., you can&#39;t decrease 0 or increase 9). This interpretation would mean that for displayed digits 0 and 9, their original digits are uniquely determined, while for others, there are two possibilities. But given the problem statement says &quot;each digit either increased by 1 or decreased by 1&quot;, if we take that to mean that each digit must have changed by exactly 1, then for 0 and 9, only one direction is possible (since the other direction would be impossible). Therefore, the original digits for 0 must be 1, and for 9 must be 8. Hence, the original time is 18:18.This seems to be the intended answer, as it&#39;s unique. The initial approach considered wrapping, but if we assume no wrapping (i.e., digits can&#39;t go below 0 or above 9), then the answer is uniquely 18:18.Therefore, the actual time was 18:18.&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves determining the original time on a clock that displayed 09:09 after each digit was either increased or decreased by 1. Considering each digit individually and ensuring valid transitions (without wrapping around, meaning 0 cannot decrease to 9 and 9 cannot increase to 0), we analyze the possibilities:1. First hour digit (0): Can only be increased from 1 (since decreasing 0 is invalid).2. Second hour digit (9): Can only be decreased from 8 (since increasing 9 is invalid).3. First minute digit (0): Can only be increased from 1.4. Second minute digit (9): Can only be decreased from 8.Combining these, the original time must be 18:18, as each digit transitions correctly to 09:09 without invalid operations. boxed{18:18}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>Answer: at 18 hours 18 minutes.#</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-01194480 data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review" data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review-title" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>❓:</span>For a sequence (a_{n})_{ngeq 1} of real numbers it is known that a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n+2} for ngeq 2.What is the largest number of its consecutive elements that can all be positive?</div><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this sequence ( (a_n)_{n geq 1} ) where each term is a real number. The problem states that for ( n geq 2 ), the term ( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ). I need to find the largest number of consecutive elements that can all be positive. Hmm, let&#39;s try to unpack this step by step.First, let me write down the recurrence relation given: ( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ) for ( n geq 2 ). Wait, that&#39;s a bit unusual. Normally, recurrence relations relate a term to previous terms, but here ( a_n ) is expressed in terms of a previous term ( a_{n-1} ) and a future term ( a_{n+2} ). That seems a bit non-standard. So if I rearrange this equation to solve for ( a_{n+2} ), maybe I can express the future term in terms of the current and past terms. Let me try that.Starting with ( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ). If I subtract ( a_{n-1} ) from both sides, I get ( a_n - a_{n-1} = a_{n+2} ). Then, rearranged, that would be ( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ). So this gives me a way to express ( a_{n+2} ) in terms of ( a_n ) and ( a_{n-1} ). So the recurrence relation is ( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ).Alternatively, shifting the index: if I replace ( n ) with ( n-2 ), then the equation becomes ( a_{n} = a_{n-3} - a_{n-4} ) for ( n geq 4 ). Wait, is that right? Let me check:Original equation is ( a_{k} = a_{k-1} + a_{k+2} ) for ( k geq 2 ). So if I set ( k = n-2 ), then for ( n-2 geq 2 ) (i.e., ( n geq 4 )), we have ( a_{n-2} = a_{n-3} + a_{n} ). Solving for ( a_n ), we get ( a_n = a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} ). Okay, so the recurrence can be written as ( a_n = a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} ) for ( n geq 4 ). That seems more manageable.So the recurrence is linear and relates each term to two terms before it minus three terms before. Hmm. So perhaps I can write down a characteristic equation for this recurrence relation.For linear recursions with constant coefficients, the standard approach is to assume solutions of the form ( a_n = r^n ) and substitute into the recurrence relation. Let&#39;s try that.Assume ( a_n = r^n ). Then substituting into the recurrence ( a_n = a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} ), we get:( r^n = r^{n-2} - r^{n-3} ).Divide both sides by ( r^{n-3} ) (assuming ( r neq 0 )):( r^3 = r - 1 ).Thus, the characteristic equation is ( r^3 - r + 1 = 0 ).Now, we need to find the roots of this cubic equation: ( r^3 - r + 1 = 0 ).Let me try to factor this. Maybe there&#39;s a rational root. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are ( pm1 ).Testing ( r = 1 ): ( 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 neq 0 ).Testing ( r = -1 ): ( -1 - (-1) + 1 = -1 +1 +1 =1 neq 0 ).So no rational roots. Hmm, so we need to find roots another way. Maybe using Cardano&#39;s method or numerical methods? Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this as a cubic. Alternatively, since it&#39;s a cubic with no rational roots, maybe it has one real root and two complex conjugate roots. Let&#39;s check.Take the derivative ( 3r^2 -1 ). Setting to zero, critical points at ( r = pm sqrt{1/3} approx pm0.577 ).Evaluating the original function at ( r = sqrt{1/3} approx 0.577 ):( (sqrt{1/3})^3 - sqrt{1/3} +1 approx (0.192) - 0.577 +1 ≈ 0.615 &gt;0 ).At ( r = -sqrt{1/3} approx -0.577 ):( (-sqrt{1/3})^3 - (-sqrt{1/3}) +1 ≈ (-0.192) +0.577 +1 ≈1.385 &gt;0 ).So the function is positive at both critical points. Since the leading term ( r^3 ) dominates as ( r to infty ), the function tends to ( +infty ) as ( r to infty ) and ( -infty ) as ( r to -infty ). But since at both critical points, the function is positive, and the function is decreasing from ( -infty ) up to ( r = -sqrt{1/3} ), then increasing from there to ( r = sqrt{1/3} ), then decreasing again. Wait, maybe my analysis is off. Let me think again.Wait, the derivative is ( 3r^2 -1 ), which is positive when ( |r| &gt; sqrt{1/3} approx0.577 ), negative otherwise. So the function is increasing on ( (-infty, -sqrt{1/3}) ), decreasing on ( (-sqrt{1/3}, sqrt{1/3}) ), and increasing again on ( (sqrt{1/3}, infty) ).Therefore, since at ( r = -sqrt{1/3} ), the function is 1.385 &gt;0 and as ( r to -infty ), the function tends to ( -infty ), so there must be one real root at ( r &lt; -sqrt{1/3} ). Then, between ( -sqrt{1/3} ) and ( sqrt{1/3} ), the function decreases from 1.385 to ~0.615, so no crossing here. Then, increasing again from 0.615 to infinity. Therefore, there is only one real root, which is less than ( -sqrt{1/3} ), and two complex conjugate roots. So the general solution of the recurrence relation is ( a_n = A r_1^n + B r_2^n + C r_3^n ), where ( r_1 ) is the real root, and ( r_2, r_3 ) are complex conjugates. However, since we are dealing with real numbers, we can also write the solution in terms of real functions involving sines and cosines.But maybe instead of going through the characteristic equation, which might be complicated due to complex roots, perhaps there&#39;s another approach here. The problem is asking about the maximum number of consecutive positive terms. So maybe instead of solving the recurrence in general, we can look for a pattern or specific constraints.Let me try writing out the first few terms in terms of the initial conditions. Let&#39;s denote the first term ( a_1 ), second term ( a_2 ), third term ( a_3 ), and so on. The recurrence is given for ( n geq 2 ): ( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ). Wait, so if I rearrange that, as before, ( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ).So starting from ( n=2 ): ( a_{2+2}=a_4 = a_2 - a_{1} ).Similarly, for ( n=3 ): ( a_{5} = a_3 - a_{2} ).For ( n=4 ): ( a_{6} = a_4 - a_{3} = (a_2 - a_1) - a_3 ).For ( n=5 ): ( a_{7} = a_5 - a_{4} = (a_3 - a_2) - (a_2 - a_1) = a_3 - a_2 - a_2 + a_1 = a_3 - 2a_2 + a_1 ).Continuing, for ( n=6 ): ( a_{8} = a_6 - a_5 = [ (a_2 - a_1 - a_3) ] - (a_3 - a_2) = a_2 - a_1 - a_3 - a_3 + a_2 = 2a_2 - a_1 - 2a_3 ).Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to tabulate these terms with some variables.Let me assign variables:Let ( a_1 = x ),( a_2 = y ),( a_3 = z ).Then, according to the recurrence:( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = y - x ),( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 = z - y ),( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = (y - x) - z = y - x - z ),( a_7 = a_5 - a_4 = (z - y) - (y - x) = z - y - y + x = x - 2y + z ),( a_8 = a_6 - a_5 = (y - x - z) - (z - y) = y - x - z - z + y = 2y - x - 2z ),( a_9 = a_7 - a_6 = (x - 2y + z) - (y - x - z) = x - 2y + z - y + x + z = 2x - 3y + 2z ),( a_{10} = a_8 - a_7 = (2y - x - 2z) - (x - 2y + z) = 2y - x - 2z - x + 2y - z = -2x + 4y - 3z ),( a_{11} = a_9 - a_8 = (2x - 3y + 2z) - (2y - x - 2z) = 2x - 3y + 2z - 2y + x + 2z = 3x - 5y + 4z ),( a_{12} = a_{10} - a_9 = (-2x + 4y - 3z) - (2x - 3y + 2z) = -2x +4y -3z -2x +3y -2z = -4x +7y -5z ),Hmm, this is getting messy. The coefficients of x, y, z are increasing in magnitude. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a pattern here.Alternatively, maybe if I can assume that there exists a sequence where several consecutive terms are positive, and then see how long that can be. The problem is asking for the largest number of consecutive positive elements possible. So maybe starting from some initial terms, set them positive, and see how far the positivity can go before a term becomes non-positive.Suppose I want as many consecutive positive terms as possible. Let&#39;s suppose that the first k terms are all positive, and the (k+1)th term is non-positive. The question is to find the maximum possible k.Given that, maybe we can set up equations for the initial terms such that as many terms as possible stay positive, but then force the next term to be non-positive.Let me attempt to set up such a scenario.Let me assume that ( a_1 &gt; 0 ), ( a_2 &gt; 0 ), ( a_3 &gt; 0 ), and so on as much as possible.But given the recurrence, ( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ). So each term is determined by two terms before minus the term before that. So even if ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) are positive, the next term ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 ). For ( a_4 ) to be positive, we need ( a_2 &gt; a_1 ).Similarly, ( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 ). For ( a_5 &gt; 0 ), ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ).( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_3 ). For ( a_6 &gt; 0 ), ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 ). But since ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ) (from ( a_5 &gt; 0 )), then ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 ) would require ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 &gt; a_2 ), which would imply ( -a_1 &gt; 0 ), but ( a_1 &gt; 0 ). Contradiction. Therefore, ( a_6 ) cannot be positive if ( a_4, a_5 ) are positive. Therefore, if we have ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) positive, then ( a_6 ) must be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms is 5? But wait, let me check.Wait, let&#39;s try with specific numbers. Let&#39;s choose ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) such that ( a_4, a_5 ) are positive, but ( a_6 ) is negative. Let&#39;s see.Let me pick ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 2 ), ( a_3 = 3 ).Then ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 2 -1 =1 &gt;0 ).( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 =3 -2=1 &gt;0 ).( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 =1 -3= -2 &lt;0 ).So in this case, the first five terms ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) are positive, and ( a_6 ) is negative. Therefore, there are five consecutive positive terms.But maybe with different initial terms, we can get more?Wait, let me try another set. Suppose I set ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_2 = 3 ), ( a_3 = 4 ).Then ( a_4 = 3 -1=2 &gt;0 ).( a_5 =4 -3=1 &gt;0 ).( a_6=2 -4= -2 &lt;0 ). Still, five terms.Alternatively, if I make ( a_3 ) larger. Let&#39;s try ( a_1 =1 ), ( a_2=4 ), ( a_3=5 ).Then ( a_4 =4 -1=3 &gt;0 ).( a_5=5 -4=1 &gt;0 ).( a_6=3 -5= -2 &lt;0 ). Still five terms.Alternatively, maybe if ( a_5 ) is positive but smaller, can ( a_6 ) be positive?Wait, let&#39;s suppose ( a_1 =1 ), ( a_2=2 ), ( a_3=1.5 ).Then ( a_4=2 -1=1 &gt;0 ).( a_5=1.5 -2= -0.5 &lt;0 ). So here, ( a_5 ) is negative. Therefore, only four consecutive positive terms.Alternatively, if ( a_3 =2.5 ).( a_1=1 ), ( a_2=2 ), ( a_3=2.5 ).Then ( a_4=2 -1=1 &gt;0 ).( a_5=2.5 -2=0.5 &gt;0 ).( a_6=1 -2.5= -1.5 &lt;0 ). Again, five terms.Wait, seems like five is the maximum here. Let me see if there&#39;s a way to get six positive terms.Suppose I want ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ) all positive. Then:( a_1 &gt;0 ),( a_2 &gt;0 ),( a_3 &gt;0 ),( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 &gt;0 implies a_2 &gt; a_1 ),( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 &gt;0 implies a_3 &gt; a_2 ),( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 &gt;0 implies (a_2 - a_1) &gt; a_3 ).But from above, ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), so ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 &gt; a_2 implies a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_2 implies -a_1 &gt;0 implies a_1 &lt;0 ), which contradicts ( a_1 &gt;0 ). Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for ( a_6 ) to be positive if ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) are positive. Therefore, six consecutive positive terms are impossible.Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms is five. However, wait, in the examples above, ( a_1 ) through ( a_5 ) are positive, but ( a_6 ) is negative. So five consecutive positive terms. But is this always the case? Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, suppose that the consecutive positive terms start from a different position, not necessarily starting at ( a_1 ). Maybe we can have a longer sequence of positive terms if they don&#39;t start at the beginning? For example, maybe starting at ( a_2 ).But the problem says &quot;the largest number of its consecutive elements that can all be positive&quot;. So it&#39;s about any consecutive elements, not necessarily starting from the first term. So perhaps if we can have a run of positive terms starting later in the sequence. But given the recurrence relation, would that help?Suppose we have a run starting at ( a_k ). Let&#39;s say ( a_k, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, dots, a_{k+m} ) are all positive. How does the recurrence affect this?But since the recurrence is ( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ), for ( n geq 2 ), which can be rewritten as ( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ). So each term two places ahead is determined by the current term minus the one before. So if we have a run of positive terms, the terms ahead are determined by this relation.Wait, let&#39;s suppose that there is a run starting at term ( a_k ). Then to have ( a_{k}, a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, ..., a_{k+m} ) positive, we need to satisfy the conditions:For each ( n geq 2 ), ( a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} ). So in terms of the run, for the indices ( k+2 leq n leq k+m-2 ), the recurrence would relate terms inside the run. But actually, the recurrence is applicable for all ( n geq 2 ), so even terms outside the run are related.Alternatively, maybe the maximum run is still five, even if not starting at the beginning. Let me see.Suppose we have a run starting at ( a_4 ): ( a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8 ). Let me see if these can all be positive.But ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 ).So if ( a_4 ) is positive, then ( a_2 &gt; a_1 ).( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 ). If ( a_5 ) is positive, ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ).( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_3 ). To have ( a_6 &gt;0 ), ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 ).But ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), so ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 &gt; a_2 implies a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_2 implies -a_1 &gt;0 implies a_1 &lt;0 ). So if we allow ( a_1 ) to be negative, then maybe ( a_4, a_5, a_6 ) can be positive. But then, what about ( a_7 )?( a_7 = a_5 - a_4 = (a_3 - a_2) - (a_2 - a_1) = a_3 - a_2 - a_2 + a_1 = a_3 - 2a_2 + a_1 ).If we need ( a_7 &gt;0 ), then ( a_3 - 2a_2 + a_1 &gt;0 ).Given that ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ) (from ( a_5 &gt;0 )), and ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 ) (from ( a_6 &gt;0 )), which implies ( a_1 &lt; a_2 - a_3 ). But ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), so ( a_2 - a_3 ) is negative, so ( a_1 &lt; negative number ).So ( a_1 ) is negative, ( a_2 &gt; a_1 ), but since ( a_1 ) is negative, ( a_2 ) could be positive or negative. Let&#39;s assume ( a_2 ) is positive. Then ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), so ( a_3 ) is positive. Then ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 ), with ( a_1 ) negative, so ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = a_2 + |a_1| ), which is positive. Then ( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 ), which is positive as ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ). Then ( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = (a_2 + |a_1|) - a_3 ). But since ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), ( a_2 + |a_1| - a_3 = |a_1| - (a_3 - a_2) ). Since ( a_3 - a_2 ) is positive (from ( a_5 &gt;0 )), then ( a_6 = |a_1| - (a_3 - a_2) ). For ( a_6 &gt;0 ), we need ( |a_1| &gt; a_3 - a_2 ).Moving on, ( a_7 = a_5 - a_4 = (a_3 - a_2) - (a_2 + |a_1|) = a_3 - a_2 - a_2 - |a_1| = a_3 - 2a_2 - |a_1| ). For ( a_7 &gt;0 ), need ( a_3 - 2a_2 - |a_1| &gt;0 ).But from the previous condition ( |a_1| &gt; a_3 - a_2 ), so substituting ( |a_1| = something geq a_3 - a_2 ), then ( a_3 - 2a_2 - |a_1| leq a_3 - 2a_2 - (a_3 - a_2) = a_3 -2a_2 -a_3 +a_2 = -a_2 &lt;0 ). Therefore, ( a_7 leq -a_2 &lt;0 ). So even if ( a_6 &gt;0 ), ( a_7 ) must be negative. Therefore, the run can&#39;t extend to ( a_7 ). Therefore, starting from ( a_4 ), the maximum run would be ( a_4, a_5, a_6 ), three terms. But in the previous case starting from ( a_1 ), we had five terms. So starting from the beginning gives a longer run.Alternatively, maybe starting from ( a_2 ):Suppose ( a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ) are positive.But ( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 ). For ( a_6 &gt;0 ), ( a_4 &gt; a_3 ).But ( a_4 = a_2 - a_1 ). If ( a_1 ) is such that ( a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3 ), which would require ( a_1 &lt; a_2 - a_3 ). If ( a_3 &gt; a_2 ), then ( a_2 - a_3 ) is negative, so ( a_1 &lt; negative ). But then ( a_1 ) is negative. Then, ( a_2 ) is positive, ( a_3 ) is greater than ( a_2 ), so positive. ( a_4 = a_2 -a_1 = a_2 + |a_1| ), positive. ( a_5 = a_3 - a_2 ), positive. ( a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = (a_2 + |a_1|) - a_3 ). Again, similar to the previous case, for ( a_6 &gt;0 ), need ( |a_1| &gt; a_3 -a_2 ). Then ( a_7 = a_5 - a_4 = (a_3 -a_2) - (a_2 + |a_1|) = a_3 -2a_2 - |a_1| ). Which, as before, would be negative.Therefore, even starting at ( a_2 ), the maximum consecutive positive terms would be five (from ( a_2 ) to ( a_6 )) only if ( a_7 ) is negative. But in reality, as shown, ( a_7 ) would be negative. Wait, no. If the run is ( a_2 ) to ( a_6 ), that&#39;s five terms. Then ( a_7 ) would be negative. So that&#39;s five terms. But previously, starting from ( a_1 ), we had five terms as well. So maybe five is indeed the maximum.But let me test with specific numbers where ( a_1 ) is negative, allowing ( a_4, a_5, a_6 ) to be positive. Let&#39;s try:Let ( a_1 = -2 ), ( a_2 =1 ), ( a_3 =3 ).Then:( a_4 = a_2 -a_1 =1 -(-2)=3 &gt;0 ).( a_5 = a_3 -a_2 =3 -1=2 &gt;0 ).( a_6 =a_4 -a_3=3 -3=0 ). Hmm, zero is non-positive. So that&#39;s not good. Let&#39;s adjust.Let me take ( a_1 = -1 ), ( a_2 =2 ), ( a_3 =3 ).Then:( a_4 =2 -(-1)=3 &gt;0 ),( a_5=3 -2=1 &gt;0 ),( a_6=3 -3=0 ). Again, zero. Maybe different numbers.( a_1 = -0.5 ), ( a_2 =1 ), ( a_3 =1.5 ).Then:( a_4=1 -(-0.5)=1.5 &gt;0 ),( a_5=1.5 -1=0.5 &gt;0 ),( a_6=1.5 -1.5=0 ). Still zero. Hmm.Wait, perhaps if ( a_3 ) is smaller.Let ( a_1 = -1 ), ( a_2 =3 ), ( a_3 =4 ).Then:( a_4=3 -(-1)=4 &gt;0 ),( a_5=4 -3=1 &gt;0 ),( a_6=4 -4=0 ). Still zero.Alternatively, ( a_1 = -2 ), ( a_2=3 ), ( a_3=4 ).Then:( a_4=3 -(-2)=5 &gt;0 ),( a_5=4 -3=1 &gt;0 ),( a_6=5 -4=1 &gt;0 ).( a_7=1 -5= -4 &lt;0 ).So here, starting from ( a_4 ), we have ( a_4, a_5, a_6 ) positive. That&#39;s three terms, but starting from the beginning, ( a_1 ) is negative, so the first positive run is ( a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ), which is five terms. Wait, ( a_2=3 &gt;0 ), ( a_3=4 &gt;0 ), ( a_4=5 &gt;0 ), ( a_5=1 &gt;0 ), ( a_6=1 &gt;0 ). Then ( a_7=-4 ). So here, from ( a_2 ) to ( a_6 ), that&#39;s five consecutive positive terms. So even though ( a_1 ) is negative, the run starts at ( a_2 ). So this is five terms. But in this case, can we get more?Wait, but in this example, ( a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ) are positive. So five terms. Is it possible to have six?Suppose we try:Let ( a_1 = -3 ), ( a_2 =1 ), ( a_3=2 ).Then:( a_4 =1 -(-3)=4 &gt;0 ),( a_5=2 -1=1 &gt;0 ),( a_6=4 -2=2 &gt;0 ),( a_7=1 -4= -3 &lt;0 ).Here, the positive run is ( a_4, a_5, a_6 ), three terms. But the run starting from ( a_2 ) is ( a_2=1, a_3=2, a_4=4, a_5=1, a_6=2 ). So that&#39;s five terms. Wait, ( a_2=1 ), ( a_3=2 ), ( a_4=4 ), ( a_5=1 ), ( a_6=2 ). So even though ( a_5 ) is smaller, it&#39;s still positive. Then ( a_7=-3 ). So five terms again.But perhaps if we adjust the numbers so that ( a_5 ) is larger.Let me try ( a_1 = -4 ), ( a_2=1 ), ( a_3=5 ).Then:( a_4=1 -(-4)=5 &gt;0 ),( a_5=5 -1=4 &gt;0 ),( a_6=5 -5=0 ). Hmm, zero again.Alternatively, ( a_1=-3 ), ( a_2=2 ), ( a_3=5 ).( a_4=2 -(-3)=5 &gt;0 ),( a_5=5 -2=3 &gt;0 ),( a_6=5 -5=0 ).Still zero.Alternatively, ( a_1 = -1 ), ( a_2 =0.5 ), ( a_3=2 ).Then:( a_4 =0.5 -(-1)=1.5 &gt;0 ),( a_5 =2 -0.5=1.5 &gt;0 ),( a_6=1.5 -2= -0.5 &lt;0 ).So run from ( a_2 ) to ( a_5 ): four terms. But ( a_2=0.5 ), ( a_3=2 ), ( a_4=1.5 ), ( a_5=1.5 ). But the next term ( a_6 ) is negative.Wait, maybe if I take ( a_1 = -k ), ( a_2 =1 ), ( a_3=1 + epsilon ), where ( k ) and ( epsilon ) are positive numbers. Then:( a_4 =1 -(-k)=1 +k ),( a_5=(1 + epsilon) -1= epsilon ),( a_6=(1 +k) - (1 + epsilon)=k - epsilon ).For ( a_6 &gt;0 ), ( k &gt; epsilon ).Then ( a_7= epsilon - (1 +k) = epsilon -1 -k ).To have ( a_7 &gt;0 ), need ( epsilon &gt;1 +k ).But from above, ( k &gt; epsilon ), so combining these, ( epsilon &gt;1 +k ) and ( k &gt; epsilon ), which implies ( epsilon &gt;1 +k &gt;1 + epsilon ), which implies ( epsilon &gt;1 + epsilon ), which is impossible. Therefore, ( a_7 ) must be negative. Hence, even with this parametrization, we can&#39;t get beyond five terms.Another approach: assume that there exists a sequence with six consecutive positive terms. Then show that this leads to a contradiction.Suppose ( a_n, a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, a_{n+3}, a_{n+4}, a_{n+5} ) are all positive. Then:From the recurrence, for each ( k ) from ( n ) to ( n+3 ), we have:( a_{k+2} = a_k - a_{k-1} ).Wait, but ( k ) must be ( geq 2 ). So if ( n geq 2 ), then ( k geq 2 ).Assuming the run starts at ( n geq 2 ):So ( a_n &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+1} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+2} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+3} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+4} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+5} &gt;0 ).From the recurrence:( a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} ).But since ( a_{n+2} &gt;0 ), ( a_n - a_{n-1} &gt;0 implies a_n &gt; a_{n-1} ).Similarly, ( a_{n+3} = a_{n+1} - a_n ).Since ( a_{n+3} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+1} - a_n &gt;0 implies a_{n+1} &gt;a_n ).Then ( a_{n+4} = a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = (a_n - a_{n-1}) - a_{n+1} ).But ( a_{n+4} &gt;0 implies (a_n - a_{n-1}) - a_{n+1} &gt;0 implies a_n -a_{n-1} &gt;a_{n+1} ).But from above, ( a_{n+1} &gt;a_n ), so ( a_n - a_{n-1} &gt;a_{n+1} &gt;a_n implies a_n -a_{n-1} &gt;a_n implies -a_{n-1} &gt;0 implies a_{n-1} &lt;0 ).Thus, if there&#39;s a run of six consecutive positive terms starting at ( a_n ), then ( a_{n-1} ) must be negative. So the term before the run is negative.Similarly, proceeding further:( a_{n+5} = a_{n+3} - a_{n+2} = (a_{n+1} -a_n) - (a_n -a_{n-1}) = a_{n+1} -a_n -a_n +a_{n-1} = a_{n+1} -2a_n +a_{n-1} ).Since ( a_{n+5} &gt;0 ), ( a_{n+1} -2a_n +a_{n-1} &gt;0 ).But we already have ( a_{n+1} &gt;a_n ) and ( a_{n-1} &lt;0 ). Let&#39;s substitute ( a_{n+1} = a_n + delta ), where ( delta &gt;0 ), and ( a_{n-1} = -epsilon ), where ( epsilon &gt;0 ).Then, substituting into ( a_{n+5} &gt;0 ):( (a_n + delta) -2a_n + (-epsilon) &gt;0 implies -a_n + delta - epsilon &gt;0 implies delta - epsilon &gt;a_n ).But ( a_n &gt;a_{n-1} = -epsilon implies a_n &gt; -epsilon ). But from the previous inequality, ( delta - epsilon &gt;a_n &gt; -epsilon implies delta - epsilon &gt; -epsilon implies delta &gt;0 ), which is true since ( delta &gt;0 ). However, ( delta = a_{n+1} -a_n ), and ( epsilon = -a_{n-1} ).But this doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to a contradiction yet. Let&#39;s go further.But we also have ( a_{n+4} = a_n -a_{n-1} -a_{n+1} &gt;0 ).Substituting ( a_{n+1} =a_n + delta ), ( a_{n-1} = -epsilon ):( a_n - (-epsilon) - (a_n + delta) = a_n + epsilon -a_n -delta = epsilon - delta &gt;0 implies epsilon &gt;delta ).But from ( a_{n+5} &gt;0 ), we had ( delta - epsilon &gt;a_n ). Combining with ( epsilon &gt; delta ), we get ( delta - epsilon &gt;a_n ) and ( epsilon &gt;delta implies delta - epsilon ) is negative, so ( negative number &gt;a_n ). But ( a_n &gt; -epsilon ), which is also negative. So this would require ( a_n &lt; delta - epsilon ), but since ( epsilon &gt;delta ), ( delta - epsilon ) is negative. So, for example, if ( a_n ) is negative, but we have ( a_n &gt; -epsilon ). However, in our assumption, ( a_n ) is part of the consecutive positive terms. Wait, no. If the run starts at ( a_n ), then ( a_n &gt;0 ), but ( a_{n-1} &lt;0 ). So ( a_n ) is positive, but ( a_{n-1} ) is negative.So substituting ( a_n &gt;0 ), ( delta = a_{n+1} -a_n &gt;0 ), ( epsilon = -a_{n-1} &gt;0 ).From ( epsilon &gt;delta ), and ( delta - epsilon &gt;a_n ), since ( epsilon &gt;delta ), ( delta - epsilon ) is negative, so ( a_n &lt; delta - epsilon ). But ( a_n &gt;0 ), so ( 0 &lt;a_n &lt;delta - epsilon ). But ( delta - epsilon ) is negative, which contradicts ( a_n &gt;0 ). Therefore, this is impossible.Therefore, assuming that there is a run of six consecutive positive terms leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive positive elements is five.To confirm, let&#39;s revisit the first example:( a_1 =1 ), ( a_2=2 ), ( a_3=3 ), leading to ( a_4=1 ), ( a_5=1 ), ( a_6=-2 ). So five positive terms. If we adjust the initial terms:Let me try to make ( a_1 =1 ), ( a_2=3 ), ( a_3=4 ).Then ( a_4=3 -1=2 ), ( a_5=4 -3=1 ), ( a_6=2 -4=-2 ). Still five terms.Alternatively, ( a_1 =2 ), ( a_2=5 ), ( a_3=7 ).( a_4=5 -2=3 ), ( a_5=7 -5=2 ), ( a_6=3 -7=-4 ). Five terms.Alternatively, ( a_1 =0.5 ), ( a_2=1 ), ( a_3=1.5 ).( a_4=1 -0.5=0.5 ), ( a_5=1.5 -1=0.5 ), ( a_6=0.5 -1.5=-1 ). Five terms again.Therefore, in all these examples, we can get five consecutive positive terms, but not six. The key reason is that the condition for the sixth term to be positive leads to a contradiction given the previous terms&#39; positivity.Hence, the largest number of consecutive positive elements is five.Final Answerboxed{5}&lt;/think&gt;Given a sequence ((a_n)_{n geq 1}) of real numbers where (a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2}) for (n geq 2), we need to determine the largest number of consecutive positive elements.First, we rearrange the given recurrence relation to express future terms in terms of previous terms:[a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} quad text{for} quad n geq 2]We analyze the sequence by considering initial terms and subsequent terms generated by the recurrence relation. Suppose we start with positive initial terms (a_1, a_2, a_3). Using the recurrence relation, we compute the next terms:1. (a_4 = a_2 - a_1)2. (a_5 = a_3 - a_2)3. (a_6 = a_4 - a_3)For (a_4) to be positive, (a_2 &gt; a_1). For (a_5) to be positive, (a_3 &gt; a_2). For (a_6) to be positive, (a_4 &gt; a_3). However, since (a_3 &gt; a_2) and (a_4 = a_2 - a_1), this leads to a contradiction because (a_2 - a_1 &gt; a_3) implies (a_1 &lt; 0), which contradicts (a_1) being positive. Thus, (a_6) cannot be positive.Testing specific examples with different initial values, we find that the first five terms (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) can be positive, but (a_6) is non-positive. For instance:- (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3) leads to (a_4 = 1), (a_5 = 1), (a_6 = -2).Considering the possibility of consecutive positive terms starting from a different position, we find that the recurrence relation constraints still limit the number of consecutive positive terms. For example, starting from (a_2) and ensuring subsequent terms are positive leads to similar contradictions.By induction and contradiction, we conclude that having six consecutive positive terms is impossible due to the recurrence relation constraints. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive positive elements is five.[boxed{5}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. We have a sequence of real numbers (a_n) where n is at least 1. The recurrence relation given is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} for n ≥ 2. The question is asking for the largest number of consecutive elements that can all be positive. Hmm, so we need to figure out how many terms in a row can be positive under this recurrence, and what&#39;s the maximum possible.First, let me write down the recurrence relation again to make sure I understand it. For each n ≥ 2, a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2}. Wait, that&#39;s a bit unusual. Normally, recurrence relations relate a term to previous terms, but here a_n is expressed in terms of the previous term a_{n-1} and a term two places ahead, a_{n+2}. So this is a non-linear recurrence? Or maybe linear but involving future terms? That&#39;s interesting. It seems like a mix of past and future terms.Let me parse this again. For n ≥ 2, each term a_n is equal to the sum of the term before it, a_{n-1}, and the term two positions after it, a_{n+2}. So, if I rearrange the equation, maybe I can express a_{n+2} in terms of a_n and a_{n-1}. Let&#39;s try that.Starting with a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2}, subtract a_{n-1} from both sides: a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1}. Okay, so this gives us a relation for a_{n+2} in terms of a_n and a_{n-1}. So, if I let k = n + 2, then n = k - 2, and the equation becomes a_k = a_{k - 3} - a_{k - 2} for k ≥ 4. Wait, let me check that substitution.If n ≥ 2, then k = n + 2 ≥ 4. So the equation a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1} becomes a_k = a_{k - 2} - a_{k - 3} for k ≥ 4. Hmm, okay. So the recurrence relation can be rewritten as a_k = a_{k - 2} - a_{k - 3} for k ≥ 4. So starting from the fourth term, each term is equal to the term two places before it minus the term three places before. That&#39;s a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients, order 3? Let me see.Wait, the standard form for a linear recurrence is a_k = c_1 a_{k-1} + c_2 a_{k-2} + ... + c_m a_{k-m}. Here, we have a_k = a_{k - 2} - a_{k - 3}. So that&#39;s indeed a linear recurrence of order 3, but only involving terms at positions k-2 and k-3. So the characteristic equation would be r^3 = r - 1? Wait, let&#39;s check.The general approach for linear recursions is to set up the characteristic equation. For a recurrence like a_k - a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} = 0, the characteristic equation would be r^3 - r + 1 = 0. Wait, let me verify that. If we suppose a solution of the form a_k = r^k, then substituting into the recurrence:r^k - r^{k-2} + r^{k-3} = 0. Dividing both sides by r^{k-3}, we get r^3 - r + 1 = 0. Yes, so the characteristic equation is r^3 - r + 1 = 0. Hmm, solving this cubic equation might give us the roots which we can use to express the general solution.But maybe before diving into solving the characteristic equation, let&#39;s see if we can approach this problem more directly. The question is about the maximum number of consecutive positive elements. So we need to consider sequences where as many consecutive terms as possible are positive, given the recurrence. So perhaps we can try to construct such a sequence and see how long the consecutive positives can be, given the constraints of the recurrence.Alternatively, perhaps we can analyze the possible patterns that lead to a negative term, given that previous terms are positive, thereby limiting the number of consecutive positives.Given that the recurrence relates terms across different positions, maybe the key is to find a point where positivity can&#39;t be maintained anymore. Let&#39;s try to work through an example.Suppose we want as many consecutive positive terms as possible starting from some term. Let&#39;s denote the terms a_1, a_2, a_3, etc. Suppose the first k terms are positive: a_1 &gt; 0, a_2 &gt; 0, ..., a_k &gt; 0. We need to see under what conditions a_{k+1} would be non-positive, thus breaking the chain.But the recurrence given is for n ≥ 2: a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2}. So this relates a_n to a_{n-1} and a_{n+2}. Wait, but if we are starting from a_1, then for n=2, we have a_2 = a_1 + a_4. Since we want a_2 to be positive, and a_1 is positive, then a_4 must be a_2 - a_1. So a_4 is expressed in terms of a_2 and a_1.Similarly, for n=3, a_3 = a_2 + a_5. So a_5 = a_3 - a_2.For n=4, a_4 = a_3 + a_6 =&gt; a_6 = a_4 - a_3.But from earlier, a_4 = a_2 - a_1. So substituting into a_6: a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_3.But a_3 = a_2 + a_5, so a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - (a_2 + a_5) = -a_1 - a_5.If all terms up to a_5 are positive, then a_6 is negative because it&#39;s -a_1 -a_5, which is the negative of two positive terms. Therefore, a_6 is negative. So even if we try to make a_1 through a_5 positive, a_6 must be negative. Therefore, we can&#39;t have more than 5 consecutive positive terms. Wait, but let&#39;s check this step by step.Let me try to construct a sequence with as many positive terms as possible. Let&#39;s assume a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 are positive. Then according to the recurrence:For n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_4 ⇒ a_4 = a_2 - a_1. Since a_4 must be positive, this implies a_2 &gt; a_1.For n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5 ⇒ a_5 = a_3 - a_2. Since a_5 must be positive, this implies a_3 &gt; a_2.For n=4: a_4 = a_3 + a_6 ⇒ a_6 = a_4 - a_3. But from earlier, a_4 = a_2 - a_1, so substituting:a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_3. But a_3 = a_2 + a_5, so:a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - (a_2 + a_5) = -a_1 - a_5. Since both a_1 and a_5 are positive, a_6 is negative. So even if a_1 through a_5 are positive, a_6 must be negative. Therefore, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms is at most 5. But is 5 achievable? Let&#39;s check.To have a_1 through a_5 positive and a_6 negative, we need:1. a_1 &gt; 02. a_2 &gt; 03. a_3 &gt; 04. a_4 &gt; 05. a_5 &gt; 06. a_6 &lt; 0Given the recurrence:From n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_4 ⇒ a_4 = a_2 - a_1. So since a_4 &gt; 0, we have a_2 &gt; a_1.From n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5 ⇒ a_5 = a_3 - a_2. So since a_5 &gt; 0, we have a_3 &gt; a_2.From n=4: a_4 = a_3 + a_6 ⇒ a_6 = a_4 - a_3. But we already have a_4 = a_2 - a_1 and a_3 = a_2 + a_5. Substituting:a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - (a_2 + a_5) = -a_1 - a_5, which is negative as both a_1 and a_5 are positive. So that&#39;s good for a_6 being negative.But we need to check if these inequalities can hold. Let&#39;s assign some values. Let&#39;s pick a_1 = 1 (positive). Then, a_2 must be greater than a_1, so let&#39;s choose a_2 = 2. Then, a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 2 - 1 = 1, which is positive.Next, a_3 must be greater than a_2 (since a_5 = a_3 - a_2 must be positive). Let&#39;s set a_3 = 3. Then, a_5 = 3 - 2 = 1, which is positive.Now, a_4 is 1, which is positive, as required. Then, a_6 = -a_1 - a_5 = -1 -1 = -2, which is negative. So this works. So in this case, a_1 through a_5 are positive (1, 2, 3, 1, 1) and a_6 is negative. So here we have 5 consecutive positive terms. Therefore, 5 is achievable.But the question is asking for the largest number of its consecutive elements that can all be positive. So if we can achieve 5, is 5 the maximum? Is it possible to have 6?Suppose we try to make a_6 positive. Then, from a_6 = -a_1 - a_5, which is negative if a_1 and a_5 are positive. Therefore, a_6 can&#39;t be positive if a_1 and a_5 are positive. So if we want a_6 positive, we need either a_1 or a_5 to be negative. But if a_5 is negative, then since a_5 = a_3 - a_2, which would require a_3 &lt; a_2. But if a_3 &lt; a_2, then since a_3 = a_2 + a_5, then a_5 would have to be negative. So that&#39;s a possibility. Wait, let&#39;s explore that.Suppose we try to have a_6 positive. Then, a_6 = -a_1 - a_5 &gt; 0 ⇒ -a_1 - a_5 &gt; 0 ⇒ a_1 + a_5 &lt; 0. But since a_1 is given as part of the sequence, if we want a_1 positive, then a_5 must be less than -a_1. But a_5 = a_3 - a_2. So a_3 - a_2 &lt; -a_1 ⇒ a_3 &lt; a_2 - a_1. But a_3 is defined as a_2 + a_5 (from n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5). Wait, this seems conflicting.Wait, from n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5. So if a_5 is negative, then a_3 = a_2 + a_5 &lt; a_2. But also, a_5 = a_3 - a_2. Wait, substituting a_3 = a_2 + a_5 into a_5 = a_3 - a_2 gives a_5 = (a_2 + a_5) - a_2 ⇒ a_5 = a_5, which is a tautology. So no conflict there. But if we want a_5 to be negative, then a_3 must be less than a_2. So a_3 = a_2 + a_5 &lt; a_2 ⇒ a_5 &lt; 0. So if we set a_5 negative, then a_3 is less than a_2. But then, if we want a_6 positive, we need a_1 + a_5 &lt; 0. Since a_1 is positive, a_5 must be less than -a_1.But then, a_5 = a_3 - a_2. If a_3 is less than a_2, then a_5 is negative. Let&#39;s take a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3. Then, from n=2: a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2. So a_4 = 2. Then, for a_3, let&#39;s set a_3 = 2 (which is less than a_2 = 3). Then, a_5 = a_3 - a_2 = 2 - 3 = -1. Then, a_6 = -a_1 - a_5 = -1 - (-1) = -1 +1 = 0. Hmm, a_6 is zero. But the problem states &quot;can all be positive&quot;. Zero is not positive, so even if a_6 is zero, that breaks the sequence. So in this case, even if a_5 is negative, we can&#39;t get a_6 positive. Wait, let&#39;s check:If a_5 is less than -a_1, say a_5 = -2 (which is less than -1). Then, a_3 = a_2 + a_5. Let&#39;s suppose a_2 is 3, then a_3 = 3 + (-2) = 1. Then, a_5 = -2. Then, a_6 = -a_1 -a_5 = -1 - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1. So a_6 is positive. But then, in this case, a_3 is 1, which is less than a_2 = 3. So here, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 1, a_4 = 2, a_5 = -2, a_6 = 1. Wait, but a_5 is negative here. So the consecutive positive elements would be a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, then a_5 is negative, so that breaks the chain. Then a_6 is positive again, but since a_5 is negative, the consecutive positives are up to a_4. So only 4 consecutive positives. That&#39;s worse than the previous case where we had 5 consecutive positives.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way to arrange the terms. Wait, maybe if we start with a different initial term. Let&#39;s try.Suppose a_1 = 1, a_2 = 4. Then, a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 3. Then, a_3 must be greater than a_2 (since a_5 = a_3 - a_2 &gt; 0). Let&#39;s set a_3 = 5. Then a_5 = 5 - 4 = 1. Then, a_6 = -1 -1 = -2. So again, a_1 through a_5 are positive (1, 4, 5, 3, 1) and a_6 is negative. So 5 consecutive positives.Alternatively, if we set a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2. Then a_4 = 2 -1 =1. Then, a_3 must be greater than 2. Let&#39;s say a_3 =3. Then a_5 =3 -2 =1. a_6= -1 -1 = -2. So again, 5 consecutive positives.Is there a way to get more than 5? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we try to get 6 consecutive positives. Then a_1 through a_6 must be positive. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Given that a_6 must be positive. From a_6 = -a_1 - a_5. So for a_6 &gt;0, we need -a_1 -a_5 &gt;0 ⇒ a_1 + a_5 &lt;0. But a_1 and a_5 are supposed to be positive (since we are considering a_1 through a_6 positive). Then, a_1 + a_5 is positive + positive = positive, which can&#39;t be less than 0. Contradiction. Therefore, a_6 cannot be positive if a_1 through a_5 are positive. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have 6 consecutive positive terms. Hence, the maximum is 5.But wait, maybe if a_1 is negative? But the problem says &quot;elements that can all be positive&quot;. So we need all the consecutive elements to be positive. So even if a_1 is negative, but starting from some a_k, we have consecutive positives. However, the problem says &quot;the largest number of its consecutive elements that can all be positive&quot;. So perhaps the consecutive elements don&#39;t necessarily start at a_1. But even so, the same logic would apply.Suppose we want a sequence where, say, a_2 through a_6 are positive. Then, using the recurrence, similar constraints would apply. Let&#39;s check.If a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 are positive, then:From n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_4. Since a_2 and a_4 are positive, a_1 = a_2 - a_4. So a_1 could be positive or negative. If a_4 &lt; a_2, then a_1 is positive. If a_4 &gt; a_2, a_1 is negative.But in this case, we don&#39;t care about a_1&#39;s sign because the consecutive positives start at a_2. However, to have a_7 positive, we need a_7 = -a_4 - a_6 (since n=5: a_5 = a_4 + a_7 ⇒ a_7 = a_5 - a_4. Wait, but let&#39;s redo this.Wait, for n=4: a_4 = a_3 + a_6 ⇒ a_6 = a_4 - a_3.For n=5: a_5 = a_4 + a_7 ⇒ a_7 = a_5 - a_4.For n=6: a_6 = a_5 + a_8 ⇒ a_8 = a_6 - a_5.But if we want a_7 positive, then a_5 - a_4 &gt; 0 ⇒ a_5 &gt; a_4.But a_5 = a_3 - a_2 (from n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5 ⇒ a_5 = a_3 - a_2). So a_5 &gt; a_4 ⇒ a_3 - a_2 &gt; a_4.But a_4 = a_2 - a_1 (from n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_4 ⇒ a_4 = a_2 - a_1). Therefore, substituting:a_3 - a_2 &gt; a_2 - a_1 ⇒ a_3 &gt; 2a_2 - a_1.But a_3 = a_2 + a_5 = a_2 + (a_3 - a_2) ⇒ that&#39;s just a tautology again.Alternatively, maybe we can set up specific values. Let&#39;s try:Suppose we want a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7 positive.Starting from a_2:a_2 is positive.From n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_4. Let&#39;s set a_1 negative so that a_4 can be larger than a_2. For example, let a_2 = 1, a_1 = -1, then a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 1 - (-1) = 2.Now, a_4 = 2 is positive. a_2 =1, a_4 =2.From n=3: a_3 = a_2 + a_5 ⇒ a_5 = a_3 - a_2. Since we want a_5 positive, a_3 &gt; a_2 =1. Let&#39;s set a_3 = 3, so a_5 =3 -1=2.From n=4: a_4 = a_3 + a_6 ⇒ a_6 = a_4 - a_3 = 2 -3 = -1. Wait, a_6 is negative, which contradicts the requirement that a_6 is positive. So this approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe set a_3 higher. Let&#39;s say a_3 =4. Then a_5 =4 -1=3. Then a_6 = a_4 -a_3 =2 -4=-2, which is still negative. Hmm. So even if a_3 is higher, a_6 is a_4 - a_3, which is 2 - a_3. So as a_3 increases, a_6 becomes more negative.Alternatively, maybe set a_4 higher. If a_1 is more negative, then a_4 = a_2 -a_1 can be higher. Let&#39;s try a_1 = -2. Then a_4 =1 - (-2)=3. Then a_3 = a_2 +a_5. Let&#39;s set a_3 =4, so a_5=4 -1=3. Then a_6 =a_4 -a_3=3 -4=-1, still negative. If a_3=5, then a_5=5 -1=4, and a_6=3 -5=-2. Still negative.So regardless of how we set a_3 and a_4, a_6 is a_4 -a_3, which requires a_4 &gt;a_3 to have a_6 positive. But a_4 = a_2 -a_1. Suppose a_1 is very negative, so a_4 is large. Let&#39;s say a_1 = -100, then a_4 =1 - (-100)=101. Then set a_3 =100. Then a_5 =100 -1=99. Then a_6=101 -100=1. So a_6=1, positive. Now, proceeding:From n=5: a_5 =a_4 + a_7 ⇒ a_7 =a_5 -a_4=99 -101=-2. So a_7 is negative. So even though we managed to get a_6 positive, a_7 is negative. So the consecutive positives from a_2 to a_6: that&#39;s 5 terms. Then a_7 is negative.Wait, so starting from a_2, we can get 5 consecutive positives (a_2 to a_6) if we set up the initial terms properly. But in this case, a_1 is negative. So the consecutive positives are a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6. Then a_7 is negative. So that&#39;s 5 consecutive positives.But in the previous case where a_1 was positive, we had a_1 to a_5 positive, and a_6 negative. So regardless of where the consecutive positives start, the maximum number seems to be 5. So whether starting at a_1 or a_2, you can get 5 consecutive positives, but not more.Therefore, the maximum number is 5. So the answer is 5, boxed as boxed{5}.Final Answerboxed{5}&lt;/think&gt;Given a sequence ((a_n)_{n geq 1}) of real numbers with the recurrence relation (a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2}) for (n geq 2), we need to determine the largest number of consecutive positive elements.First, we rearrange the recurrence relation for (n geq 2):[a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n-1}]This can be rewritten as a linear recurrence relation for (k geq 4):[a_k = a_{k-2} - a_{k-3}]To find the maximum number of consecutive positive elements, we analyze the sequence starting from the initial terms. Suppose we want to have consecutive positive terms starting from (a_1). For (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) to be positive, we use the recurrence relations:- For (n = 2): (a_2 = a_1 + a_4 implies a_4 = a_2 - a_1)- For (n = 3): (a_3 = a_2 + a_5 implies a_5 = a_3 - a_2)- For (n = 4): (a_4 = a_3 + a_6 implies a_6 = a_4 - a_3)Substituting (a_4 = a_2 - a_1) and (a_3 = a_2 + a_5) into the expression for (a_6):[a_6 = (a_2 - a_1) - (a_2 + a_5) = -a_1 - a_5]Since (a_1) and (a_5) are positive, (a_6) must be negative. Therefore, it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms.We verify that five consecutive positive terms are possible by constructing an example:- Let (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), then:  - (a_4 = a_2 - a_1 = 1)  - (a_5 = a_3 - a_2 = 1)  - (a_6 = -a_1 - a_5 = -2) (negative)Thus, the sequence (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 1), (a_5 = 1) has five consecutive positive terms, and (a_6) is negative. This shows that five consecutive positive terms are achievable.Therefore, the largest number of consecutive positive elements is (boxed{5}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>1. We start by analyzing the given recurrence relation for the sequence ((a_n)_{n geq 1}):   [   a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} quad text{for} quad n geq 2.   ]   This implies that each term in the sequence is the sum of the previous term and the term two places ahead.2. To find the maximum number of consecutive positive terms, we first consider a specific example. Let&#39;s take the sequence starting with (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 1), and (a_5 = 1). We check if these terms satisfy the recurrence relation:   [   a_2 = a_1 + a_4 implies 2 = 1 + 1,   ]   [   a_3 = a_2 + a_5 implies 3 = 2 + 1.   ]   Both equations are satisfied, and we have five consecutive positive terms: (1, 2, 3, 1, 1).3. Next, we need to prove that it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms. Assume there exists a sequence with six consecutive positive terms (a_n, a_{n+1}, ldots, a_{n+5}). We write down the recurrence relations for these terms:   [   a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n+3},   ]   [   a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+4},   ]   [   a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+5}.   ]4. Adding these three equations together, we get:   [   a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+3} + a_{n+1} + a_{n+4} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+5}.   ]   Simplifying, we cancel out the common terms on both sides:   [   a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+4} + a_{n+5}.   ]5. Since (a_n, a_{n+4},) and (a_{n+5}) are all positive, the right-hand side of the equation is positive. However, the left-hand side (a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}) is also positive. This leads to a contradiction because the sum of positive terms cannot equal zero. Therefore, it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms.6. Hence, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms in the sequence is 5.The final answer is (boxed{5}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-01194480 data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review" data-v-3a14aa32><div class="review-title" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>❓:</span>1.

So, we have a convex quadrilateral ABCD where angles B and D are both 90 degrees. The sides AB and AD are given as 4 and 5 units respectively, and angle A is 60 degrees. We need to find the ratio BC/CD. Hmm, okay. Let me start by drawing this quadrilateral to visualize it better.First, angle A is 60 degrees, and from point A, two sides AB and AD are coming out. AB is 4 units, and AD is 5 units. Since angles B and D are right angles, that means at points B and D, the quadrilateral turns 90 degrees. So, AB is one side, BC will be perpendicular to AB, and AD is another side, with DC perpendicular to AD. Wait, but since it&#39;s convex, all the interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Hmm, maybe I should use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the points.Let’s place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since angle A is 60 degrees, and sides AB and AD are 4 and 5 units, I can assign coordinates to points B and D. If angle A is 60 degrees, then the coordinates of B and D can be found using trigonometry. Let me see. If AB is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (4,0). But then angle A is 60 degrees, so AD makes a 60-degree angle with AB. Since AD is 5 units, the coordinates of D would be (5*cos60°, 5*sin60°). Cos60° is 0.5 and sin60° is (√3)/2, so D would be at (2.5, (5√3)/2). Let me check that. Yes, because if you go 5 units at 60 degrees from the x-axis, the x-component is 5*cos60°=2.5 and y-component is 5*sin60°= (5√3)/2≈4.33.Now, since angle B is 90°, the side BC is perpendicular to AB. AB is along the x-axis, so BC will be vertical. Since point B is at (4,0), and angle B is 90°, point C must be somewhere along the vertical line x=4. Similarly, angle D is 90°, so DC is perpendicular to AD. Let&#39;s figure out the direction of DC.AD is from A(0,0) to D(2.5, (5√3)/2). The slope of AD is [( (5√3)/2 - 0 ) / (2.5 - 0)] = ( (5√3)/2 ) / (5/2 ) = √3. So, the slope of AD is √3, which makes sense because angle A is 60°, so the slope is tan60°=√3. Since angle D is 90°, the side DC is perpendicular to AD. Therefore, the slope of DC will be the negative reciprocal of √3, which is -1/√3. So, DC has a slope of -1/√3. Since point D is at (2.5, (5√3)/2), point C must lie somewhere along the line with slope -1/√3 starting from D.But we also know that point C lies on the vertical line x=4, because BC is vertical from point B(4,0). Therefore, the intersection of these two lines (the vertical line x=4 and the line with slope -1/√3 passing through D) is point C. Let&#39;s find the coordinates of point C.First, let&#39;s write the equation of the line DC. Starting at D(2.5, (5√3)/2), with slope -1/√3. The parametric equations would be x = 2.5 + t, y = (5√3)/2 - (1/√3)t. But we need this line to intersect x=4. Let&#39;s set x=4 and solve for t.From x = 2.5 + t = 4, so t = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5. Then, substitute t=1.5 into the equation for y: y = (5√3)/2 - (1/√3)(1.5). Let&#39;s compute that:First term: (5√3)/2.Second term: (1.5)/√3 = (3/2)/√3 = (3)/(2√3) = (√3)/2 after rationalizing.Therefore, y = (5√3)/2 - (√3)/2 = (4√3)/2 = 2√3.So, point C is at (4, 2√3). Let me confirm that.Yes, since t=1.5, moving 1.5 units in the x-direction from D(2.5, ...) gives x=4. Then y decreases by (1/√3)*1.5 = (√3)/2, so from (5√3)/2, subtract (√3)/2 to get (4√3)/2 = 2√3. That looks correct.Now, having coordinates for all points:A(0,0), B(4,0), D(2.5, (5√3)/2 ≈4.33), C(4, 2√3≈3.464).Now, we need to compute BC and CD.First, BC: from B(4,0) to C(4, 2√3). Since they share the same x-coordinate, the distance is just the difference in y-coordinates: 2√3 - 0 = 2√3. So BC = 2√3.Next, CD: from C(4, 2√3) to D(2.5, (5√3)/2). Let&#39;s compute the distance between these two points.Using the distance formula: sqrt[(4 - 2.5)^2 + (2√3 - (5√3)/2)^2].Compute each part:4 - 2.5 = 1.52√3 - (5√3)/2 = (4√3)/2 - (5√3)/2 = (-√3)/2So, distance CD = sqrt[(1.5)^2 + (-√3/2)^2] = sqrt[2.25 + (3/4)] = sqrt[2.25 + 0.75] = sqrt[3] ≈1.732.Therefore, BC = 2√3, CD = sqrt(3). Therefore, the ratio BC/CD = (2√3)/√3 = 2.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check the coordinates and the distances.Point D is (2.5, (5√3)/2). Point C is (4, 2√3). Let&#39;s compute the difference in coordinates:Δx = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5Δy = 2√3 - (5√3)/2 = (4√3 - 5√3)/2 = (-√3)/2Therefore, squared differences:(1.5)^2 = 2.25(-√3/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75Sum: 2.25 + 0.75 = 3sqrt(3) ≈1.732. So CD = sqrt(3). BC is from (4,0) to (4,2√3), which is just 2√3. So ratio is 2√3 / sqrt(3) = 2. So the answer is 2. Hmm. But let me think again to see if there&#39;s a mistake.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach using vectors or trigonometry.Alternatively, since angle A is 60 degrees, and sides AB=4, AD=5. Let me confirm using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABD? Wait, but ABD is not necessarily a triangle. Wait, ABCD is a quadrilateral. But perhaps triangle ABD? Wait, points A, B, D. Wait, but BD is a diagonal. Let me compute BD.Wait, in coordinate terms, points B(4,0) and D(2.5, (5√3)/2). The distance between them is sqrt[(4 - 2.5)^2 + (0 - (5√3)/2)^2] = sqrt[2.25 + (25*3)/4] = sqrt[2.25 + 18.75] = sqrt[21] ≈4.583. Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe using areas. But since it&#39;s a convex quadrilateral with two right angles, maybe breaking it into rectangles and triangles. But perhaps coordinate geometry was straightforward here.Wait, but according to the coordinates, BC is 2√3 and CD is sqrt(3), so ratio is 2. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe express BC and CD in terms of the sides given.But let me check another way. Since angle at B and D are 90°, we can consider the quadrilateral as having two right triangles: triangle ABC and triangle ADC. Wait, no. Wait, in the quadrilateral ABCD, with right angles at B and D. So AB is perpendicular to BC, and AD is perpendicular to DC. So from point B, moving perpendicular to AB (which is vertical, since AB is along x-axis) gives BC upwards. From D, moving perpendicular to AD gives DC. Since AD has slope √3, perpendicular is slope -1/√3, which we already considered.Alternatively, maybe using vectors. The vector AD is (2.5, (5√3)/2). The direction of DC is perpendicular to AD, so direction vector (- (5√3)/2, 2.5). Wait, but scaling. Wait, the direction vector perpendicular to AD would be (-dy, dx), so if AD is (2.5, (5√3)/2), then perpendicular vector is (- (5√3)/2, 2.5). Then parametrizing DC as starting from D and moving along this direction until it reaches x=4. But maybe this is more complicated. The coordinate method seems to have worked.Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if the quadrilateral is indeed convex with these coordinates. Points are A(0,0), B(4,0), C(4,2√3), D(2.5, (5√3)/2). Connecting these in order, the shape should be convex. Let me verify the order. Convex quadrilaterals have all interior angles less than 180 degrees. Since we have right angles at B and D, and angle at A is 60 degrees, the remaining angle at C needs to be checked. But since all the points are ordered such that the turns are all in the same direction, it should be convex.Alternatively, plotting the points roughly:A at (0,0), B at (4,0), C at (4, ~3.464), D at (2.5, ~4.33). Connecting A to B to C to D to A. This should form a convex quadrilateral because all the vertices are &quot;outwards.&quot;Therefore, I think the coordinate approach is valid here. Therefore, BC is 2√3, CD is √3, ratio is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.Wait, but let me check once more. If BC is 2√3 and CD is √3, then BC/CD = 2. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in fraction form, but 2 is already an integer. So the answer should be boxed{2}.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Given a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with (angle B = angle D = 90^circ), (AB = 4), (AD = 5), and (angle A = 60^circ), we need to find the ratio (frac{BC}{CD}).1. Coordinate Assignment:   - Place point (A) at the origin ((0,0)).   - Point (B) is at ((4,0)) since (AB = 4) and is along the x-axis.   - Point (D) is at ((2.5, frac{5sqrt{3}}{2})) using trigonometry for a 60° angle from (A) with (AD = 5).2. Finding Coordinates of (C):   - Since (angle B = 90^circ), (BC) is vertical from (B(4,0)), so (C) lies on (x = 4).   - The line (DC) is perpendicular to (AD) (slope (-frac{1}{sqrt{3}})) and passes through (D(2.5, frac{5sqrt{3}}{2})).   - Parametric equations for line (DC): (x = 2.5 + t), (y = frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{t}{sqrt{3}}).   - Solving for intersection with (x = 4) gives (t = 1.5). Substituting (t = 1.5) into (y) gives (y = 2sqrt{3}). Thus, (C) is at ((4, 2sqrt{3})).3. Calculating Distances:   - (BC) is the vertical distance from (B(4,0)) to (C(4, 2sqrt{3})): (2sqrt{3}).   - (CD) is the distance from (C(4, 2sqrt{3})) to (D(2.5, frac{5sqrt{3}}{2})):     [     sqrt{(4 - 2.5)^2 + left(2sqrt{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{1.5^2 + left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2.25 + 0.75} = sqrt{3}     ]4. Ratio Calculation:   - The ratio (frac{BC}{CD} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = 2).Thus, the final answer is (boxed{2}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the ratio BC/CD in this convex quadrilateral ABCD where angles B and D are right angles. The given information is AB = 4, AD = 5, and angle A is 60 degrees. Hmm, let&#39;s start by drawing a diagram to visualize this. Since it&#39;s a convex quadrilateral with two right angles at B and D, maybe I can place point A somewhere and then construct the sides AB and AD accordingly.First, let me consider angle A is 60 degrees. So angle BAD is 60 degrees. Since AD is 5 and AB is 4, maybe I can model this with coordinates? Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since angle A is 60 degrees, and sides AB and AD are adjacent to angle A, perhaps I can represent AB along the x-axis and AD in the plane such that angle between AB and AD is 60 degrees.Wait, but angle B and angle D are both 90 degrees. So, if AB is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to B(4,0), then angle B is 90 degrees. That would mean BC is vertical, either up or down. Since it&#39;s convex, it should be up. Similarly, angle D is 90 degrees. So if AD is at an angle of 60 degrees from AB, then AD would be going from A(0,0) to D somewhere in the plane such that angle BAD is 60 degrees. Let me confirm the coordinates.If AB is from (0,0) to (4,0), then AD is at 60 degrees from AB. The length of AD is 5. So coordinates of D would be 5 units away from A at an angle of 60 degrees. So D would be at (5*cos60°, 5*sin60°) which is (2.5, (5*sqrt(3))/2). Let me write that down:Point A: (0,0)Point B: (4,0)Point D: (2.5, (5*sqrt(3))/2) ≈ (2.5, 4.330)Now, angle at B is 90 degrees, so BC is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is along the x-axis, BC must be vertical. So from point B(4,0), moving upward along the y-axis. Let me denote point C as (4, y). Similarly, angle at D is 90 degrees, so CD is perpendicular to AD. Wait, AD is from A(0,0) to D(2.5, 4.330). The direction of AD is 60 degrees from the x-axis, so the line AD has a slope of tan60° = sqrt(3). Therefore, the line perpendicular to AD at D would have a slope of -1/sqrt(3). So CD is a line starting from D(2.5, 4.330) with slope -1/sqrt(3). Let me write the equation of line CD.The line CD passes through D(2.5, 4.330) and has a slope of -1/sqrt(3). So its equation is y - 4.330 = (-1/sqrt(3))(x - 2.5). But point C is also on BC, which is the vertical line x=4. Therefore, to find point C, we can plug x=4 into the equation of line CD.So substituting x=4 into the equation:y - 4.330 = (-1/sqrt(3))(4 - 2.5) = (-1/sqrt(3))(1.5) = -1.5/sqrt(3) = -sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.866Therefore, y = 4.330 - 0.866 ≈ 3.464. But let&#39;s calculate this exactly.First, exact coordinates:Point D is (5/2, (5*sqrt(3))/2). So the exact equation of line CD is:y - (5*sqrt(3)/2) = (-1/sqrt(3))(x - 5/2)Substituting x=4 into this equation:y = (5*sqrt(3)/2) + (-1/sqrt(3))(4 - 5/2) = (5*sqrt(3)/2) + (-1/sqrt(3))(3/2)Simplify the second term:(-1/sqrt(3))(3/2) = - (3)/(2*sqrt(3)) = - sqrt(3)/2So y = (5*sqrt(3)/2) - sqrt(3)/2 = (4*sqrt(3))/2 = 2*sqrt(3)Therefore, point C is at (4, 2*sqrt(3)).Now, let&#39;s find BC and CD.BC is the distance from B(4,0) to C(4, 2*sqrt(3)), which is vertical, so it&#39;s just the difference in y-coordinates:BC = 2*sqrt(3) - 0 = 2*sqrt(3)CD is the distance from C(4, 2*sqrt(3)) to D(5/2, 5*sqrt(3)/2). Let&#39;s compute this using the distance formula.Distance CD = sqrt[(4 - 5/2)^2 + (2*sqrt(3) - 5*sqrt(3)/2)^2]Simplify each component:x-coordinate difference: 4 - 5/2 = 3/2y-coordinate difference: 2*sqrt(3) - (5*sqrt(3)/2) = (4*sqrt(3)/2 - 5*sqrt(3)/2) = (-sqrt(3)/2)Therefore, CD = sqrt[(3/2)^2 + (-sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(9/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[12/4] = sqrt[3]So CD = sqrt(3)Therefore, the ratio BC/CD = (2*sqrt(3))/sqrt(3) = 2Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, coordinates of D: yes, 5 units at 60 degrees from A(0,0) gives (5*cos60°, 5*sin60°) = (2.5, (5*sqrt(3))/2). That&#39;s correct.Point B is (4,0). Line BC is vertical because angle at B is 90°, so moving up along x=4. Then line CD is perpendicular to AD. The slope of AD is (5*sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(2.5 - 0) = (5*sqrt(3)/2)/2.5 = (5*sqrt(3)/2)/(5/2) = sqrt(3). So slope of AD is sqrt(3), hence the perpendicular slope is -1/sqrt(3). Therefore, equation of CD is y - 5*sqrt(3)/2 = -1/sqrt(3)(x - 2.5). Plugging x=4 into this gives y = 5*sqrt(3)/2 - (1.5)/sqrt(3). Convert 1.5 to 3/2, so 3/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, y = 5*sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 = 4*sqrt(3)/2 = 2*sqrt(3). So point C is (4, 2*sqrt(3)). Then BC is from (4,0) to (4, 2*sqrt(3)), which is 2*sqrt(3). CD is from (4,2*sqrt(3)) to (2.5, 5*sqrt(3)/2). The differences are 1.5 in x and -sqrt(3)/2 in y. Then squared terms: (9/4) + (3/4) = 12/4 = 3. Square root of 3 is sqrt(3). Therefore, BC/CD is 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) = 2. So the ratio is 2/1, so BC/CD = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.But let me confirm once again. Maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry differently.Alternatively, maybe using trigonometry. Since angle at A is 60 degrees, AB=4, AD=5. Then in triangle ABD, but wait, ABCD is a quadrilateral with right angles at B and D. Hmm, perhaps using the coordinates was the right approach. Alternatively, if I model it in 3D? No, probably 2D is sufficient.Alternatively, since angles at B and D are right angles, the quadrilateral is made of two right triangles: ABC and ADC. Wait, not exactly. Wait, ABCD is convex with right angles at B and D. So ABC is a right triangle at B, and ADC is a right triangle at D. But they share the side AC? Wait, no. Wait, ABCD is a quadrilateral, so sides AB, BC, CD, DA. But angle at B is 90°, angle at D is 90°. So ABC and ADC are both right triangles.Wait, if we consider triangles ABC and ADC, they both share the side AC. So perhaps we can compute AC via both triangles and set them equal?But maybe that&#39;s more complicated. The coordinate approach seems straightforward and gave an answer of 2, which is a clean number, so maybe that&#39;s correct. Alternatively, let me check using vectors.From point A(0,0), vector AB is (4,0). Vector AD is (5*cos60°, 5*sin60°) = (2.5, (5*sqrt(3))/2). Then point B is at (4,0), point D is at (2.5, (5*sqrt(3))/2). Then point C is at the intersection of the line perpendicular at B (so vertical line x=4) and the line perpendicular at D to AD. We found that point C is (4, 2*sqrt(3)). Then BC is 2*sqrt(3) and CD is sqrt(3). So ratio BC/CD is 2. All the steps check out. So I think that&#39;s correct.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;Given a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with (angle B = angle D = 90^circ), (AB = 4), (AD = 5), and (angle A = 60^circ), we need to find the ratio (frac{BC}{CD}).1. Coordinates of Points:   - Place (A) at the origin ((0, 0)).   - (B) is at ((4, 0)) since (AB = 4) along the x-axis.   - (D) is at ((2.5, frac{5sqrt{3}}{2})) because (AD = 5) and (angle A = 60^circ).2. Equations of Lines:   - Line (BC) is vertical (since (angle B = 90^circ)) and passes through (B(4, 0)).   - Line (CD) is perpendicular to (AD). The slope of (AD) is (sqrt{3}), so the slope of (CD) is (-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). The equation of line (CD) is (y - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(x - 2.5)).3. Finding Coordinates of (C):   - Substitute (x = 4) into the equation of line (CD):     [     y - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}(4 - 2.5)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     y = frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{1.5}{sqrt{3}} = frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3}     ]   - Thus, (C) is at ((4, 2sqrt{3})).4. Calculating Lengths:   - (BC) is the vertical distance from (B(4, 0)) to (C(4, 2sqrt{3})):     [     BC = 2sqrt{3}     ]   - (CD) is the distance from (C(4, 2sqrt{3})) to (D(2.5, frac{5sqrt{3}}{2})):     [     CD = sqrt{left(4 - 2.5right)^2 + left(2sqrt{3} - frac{5sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{left(1.5right)^2 + left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{4} + frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{3}     ]5. Ratio:   - The ratio (frac{BC}{CD}) is:     [     frac{BC}{CD} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = 2     ]Thus, the final answer is (boxed{2}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-3a14aa32></div><p class="review-content" data-v-3a14aa32><span class="icon" data-v-3a14aa32>🔑:</span>1. 2 .Connect A C, let A C=R, then sin angle D A C=frac{D C}{A C}=frac{sqrt{R^{2}-25}}{R}, cos angle D A C=frac{5}{R}, sin angle B A C=begin{array}{l}frac{B C}{A C}=frac{sqrt{R^{2}-16}}{R}, cos angle B A C=frac{A B}{A C}=frac{4}{R}, frac{1}{2}=cos 60^{circ}=cos (angle D A C+angle B A C)=frac{20}{R^{2}}- frac{sqrt{R^{2}-25} cdot sqrt{R^{2}-16}}{R^{2}}, text { i.e., } sqrt{left(R^{2}-25right)left(R^{2}-16right)}=20-frac{1}{2} R^{2}, frac{3}{4}left(R^{2}right)^{2}-21 R^{2}=0, frac{3}{4} R^{2}- 21=0 Rightarrow frac{3}{4} R^{2}=21 Rightarrow R^{2}=28, D C=sqrt{R^{2}-25}=sqrt{3}, B C=sqrt{R^{2}-16}=2 sqrt{3} . text { Therefore, } frac{B C}{C D} =2 .end{array}</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-01194480><span data-v-01194480>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
