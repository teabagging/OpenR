Hmm, let me think. Dividing two negative numbers... I remember that when you divide two numbers with the same sign, the result is positive. So, both being negative here, the answer should be positive. That&#39;s a good start. Now, ignoring the signs for a moment, let&#39;s just focus on dividing 0.91 by 0.13. Maybe I can convert these decimals into fractions to make it easier? Let&#39;s see, 0.91 is the same as 91/100, and 0.13 is 13/100. So if I divide 91/100 by 13/100, that&#39;s the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, right? So 91/100 multiplied by 100/13. The 100s would cancel out, leaving me with 91/13. Wait, 91 divided by 13... Let me check what that is. 13 times 7 is 91, because 13*7=91. So 91 divided by 13 is 7. Therefore, 0.91 divided by 0.13 is 7. Since both original numbers were negative, the result is positive 7. But let me verify this another way to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Maybe by using decimal division. If I write it out as a long division problem: 0.91 ÷ 0.13. To eliminate the decimals, I can multiply both the dividend and the divisor by 100 to make them whole numbers. That gives me 91 ÷ 13. Which again, is 7. So that confirms it. Another way to think about it: How many times does 0.13 fit into 0.91? Let&#39;s add up 0.13 repeatedly. 0.13*1=0.13, 0.13*2=0.26, 0.13*3=0.39, 0.13*4=0.52, 0.13*5=0.65, 0.13*6=0.78, 0.13*7=0.91. There we go, 7 times. So that&#39;s 7. So all methods point to the answer being 7. And since both numbers were negative, dividing two negatives gives a positive, so the final answer is positive 7. I think that&#39;s solid. Let me just check one last time with a calculator. If I take -0.91 divided by -0.13, the calculator gives 7. Yep, that&#39;s correct. So I&#39;m confident now that the answer is 7.&lt;/think&gt;To calculate ((-0.91) div (-0.13)), we start by recognizing that dividing two negative numbers yields a positive result. Next, we focus on the division of the absolute values: (0.91 div 0.13). Converting the decimals to fractions:[0.91 = frac{91}{100} quad text{and} quad 0.13 = frac{13}{100}]Dividing these fractions:[frac{91}{100} div frac{13}{100} = frac{91}{100} times frac{100}{13} = frac{91}{13} = 7]Verification through long division: Multiplying both dividend and divisor by 100 converts the problem to (91 div 13 = 7). Adding (0.13) repeatedly seven times also confirms the result.Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{7}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to calculate (-0.91) divided by (-0.13). Hmm, let&#39;s see. Both numbers are negative, right? I remember that when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. So first off, the answer should be a positive number. That&#39;s a good start.Now, the actual division part. Maybe I can convert these decimals into fractions to make it easier? Let&#39;s try that. -0.91 is the same as -91/100, and -0.13 is -13/100. So if I write it as a division of fractions: (-91/100) ÷ (-13/100). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that becomes (-91/100) * (-100/13). Wait, the negatives will cancel each other out because there are two negatives, so that becomes (91/100) * (100/13). The 100s in the numerator and denominator will also cancel out. So now it&#39;s 91/13. Hmm, 91 divided by 13. Let me check that. 13 times 7 is 91 because 13*7=91. So 91 divided by 13 is 7. Therefore, the answer should be 7. Let me verify that.Alternatively, maybe I can do decimal division. Let&#39;s see. If I have -0.91 divided by -0.13. Since both are negative, as I thought before, it&#39;s positive. So 0.91 divided by 0.13. To make it easier, I can count how many times 0.13 goes into 0.91. 0.13 times 7 is 0.91 because 0.13*7: 0.13*7=0.91. So that checks out. So again, the answer is 7. Wait, maybe there&#39;s another way to think about this. Let me move the decimal points to make whole numbers. If I multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals, that would give me (-91) ÷ (-13) which is the same as 91 ÷13, which is 7. Yeah, that works too.So all methods point to the answer being 7. Let me just double-check using a calculator in my mind. 0.13 times 7: 0.13 * 7. 0.1*7 is 0.7, and 0.03*7 is 0.21. Adding those together, 0.7 + 0.21 = 0.91. Perfect, that&#39;s exactly the numerator. So it&#39;s correct.Therefore, the result is 7. All the negatives cancel, and the division works out neatly. I don&#39;t think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that dividing two negatives gives a positive and then handling the decimals by converting them or scaling them up to whole numbers. Either way, it simplifies to 7. Just to recap: Original problem (-0.91)/(-0.13) becomes positive, then division of 0.91 by 0.13. Convert decimals to fractions or scale up by 100 to remove decimals. Both methods lead to 91 divided by 13 equals 7. Verified through multiplication. All checks confirm the answer is 7. So I&#39;m confident that&#39;s the right answer.Final Answerboxed{7}&lt;/think&gt;To calculate ((-0.91) div (-0.13)), we start by noting that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive number. Therefore, we need to compute (0.91 div 0.13).We can convert the decimals into fractions:[-0.91 = -frac{91}{100} quad text{and} quad -0.13 = -frac{13}{100}]Dividing these fractions:[left(-frac{91}{100}right) div left(-frac{13}{100}right) = left(frac{91}{100}right) div left(frac{13}{100}right)]This is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal:[frac{91}{100} times frac{100}{13} = frac{91 times 100}{100 times 13} = frac{91}{13} = 7]Alternatively, by moving the decimal points two places to the right (multiplying both numbers by 100), we convert the division into whole numbers:[91 div 13 = 7]Both methods confirm that the result is (7). Verifying through multiplication, (0.13 times 7 = 0.91), which matches the original numerator.Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{7}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>Solution: (-0.91) div (-0.13) = 7.Therefore, the answer is boxed{7}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>Given that the solution to the equation 5m+3x=1+x is 2 greater than the solution to the equation 2x+m=3m, find the value of 7m^{2}-1.</div><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to solve this problem. Hmm, so we have two equations here. The first one is 5m + 3x = 1 + x, and the second one is 2x + m = 3m. The problem says that the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation, and we need to find the value of 7m² - 1. Alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what they mean by &quot;the solution to the equation.&quot; Since both equations are linear equations with variables x and m, I think they mean solving each equation for x in terms of m and then setting up a relationship between the two solutions. Because the problem mentions that the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second one, that must mean that the x value from the first equation is 2 more than the x value from the second equation. So, if I solve both equations for x, then set the x from the first equation equal to the x from the second equation plus 2, I can find m. Once I have m, I can compute 7m² - 1.Let me start with the first equation: 5m + 3x = 1 + x. I need to solve for x here. Let&#39;s subtract x from both sides to get 5m + 2x = 1. Then, subtract 5m from both sides: 2x = 1 - 5m. Then divide both sides by 2: x = (1 - 5m)/2. So, the solution for x in the first equation is (1 - 5m)/2.Now, the second equation: 2x + m = 3m. Let me solve for x here as well. Subtract m from both sides: 2x = 2m. Then divide both sides by 2: x = m. So, the solution for x in the second equation is m.According to the problem, the solution to the first equation (which is (1 - 5m)/2) is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation (which is m). So, translating that into an equation: (1 - 5m)/2 = m + 2. Wait, is that right? If the first solution is 2 greater than the second, then first solution = second solution + 2. Yes, so (1 - 5m)/2 = m + 2.Alright, now I need to solve this equation for m. Let&#39;s do that step by step. First, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 1 - 5m = 2(m + 2). Expand the right side: 1 - 5m = 2m + 4. Now, bring all terms to one side. Let&#39;s add 5m to both sides and subtract 4 from both sides: 1 - 4 = 2m + 5m. That simplifies to -3 = 7m. Therefore, m = -3/7.Wait, so m is -3/7. Let me check that again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake. Starting from (1 - 5m)/2 = m + 2.Multiply both sides by 2: 1 - 5m = 2m + 4.Then, add 5m to both sides: 1 = 7m + 4.Subtract 4 from both sides: -3 = 7m.Yes, so m = -3/7. That seems correct.Now, we need to compute 7m² - 1. Let&#39;s plug in m = -3/7. First, square m: (-3/7)² = 9/49. Then multiply by 7: 7*(9/49) = 9/7. Then subtract 1: 9/7 - 1 = 9/7 - 7/7 = 2/7. Therefore, 7m² - 1 = 2/7.Wait, let me verify the calculations again. Squaring -3/7: yes, that&#39;s 9/49. Multiplying by 7: 9/49 *7 = 9/7. Then subtract 1: 9/7 - 7/7 = 2/7. Yes, that seems right. So, the value of 7m² -1 is 2/7.But wait, let me double-check all steps because fractions can be tricky. Let me recap:1. Solve first equation for x: 5m +3x =1 +x.Subtract x: 5m +2x =1.Subtract 5m: 2x =1 -5m.Divide by 2: x=(1-5m)/2. Correct.2. Solve second equation:2x +m=3m.Subtract m:2x=2m. Divide by 2:x=m. Correct.3. Set first solution equal to second solution plus 2: (1-5m)/2 = m +2.Multiply by 2:1 -5m =2m +4.Combine terms:1 -4 =7m.-3=7m =&gt; m=-3/7. Correct.4. Compute 7m² -1:m²= (9/49). Multiply by7:9/7. Subtract1:2/7. Correct.Therefore, the answer is 2/7. So, 7m² -1 equals 2/7.I think that&#39;s the correct answer. Let me just check if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem, maybe by solving for m differently, but I don&#39;t think so. All steps seem logical and the algebra checks out. So, I think 2/7 is the right answer.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{2}{7}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations (5m + 3x = 1 + x) and (2x + m = 3m), we need to find the value of (7m^2 - 1) given that the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation.First, solve the first equation for (x):[5m + 3x = 1 + x]Subtract (x) from both sides:[5m + 2x = 1]Subtract (5m) from both sides:[2x = 1 - 5m]Divide by 2:[x = frac{1 - 5m}{2}]Next, solve the second equation for (x):[2x + m = 3m]Subtract (m) from both sides:[2x = 2m]Divide by 2:[x = m]According to the problem, the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation. Therefore, we set up the equation:[frac{1 - 5m}{2} = m + 2]Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:[1 - 5m = 2(m + 2)]Expand the right side:[1 - 5m = 2m + 4]Combine like terms:[1 - 4 = 7m][-3 = 7m]Solve for (m):[m = -frac{3}{7}]Now, calculate (7m^2 - 1):[m^2 = left(-frac{3}{7}right)^2 = frac{9}{49}]Multiply by 7:[7 cdot frac{9}{49} = frac{9}{7}]Subtract 1:[frac{9}{7} - 1 = frac{9}{7} - frac{7}{7} = frac{2}{7}]Thus, the value of (7m^2 - 1) is (boxed{dfrac{2}{7}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the problem is about solving two equations and finding the value of 7m squared minus 1. Let me read it again carefully.We have two equations:1. 5m + 3x = 1 + x2. 2x + m = 3mAnd it says that the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation. Then we need to find 7m² - 1.Hmm, first I need to clarify what &quot;solution&quot; means here. Since both equations have variables m and x, but are they each linear equations in x? Let me check.First equation: 5m + 3x = 1 + x. If we solve for x, that would give us x in terms of m.Second equation: 2x + m = 3m. Similarly, solving for x here would also give x in terms of m.The problem states that the solution (for x) to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution (for x) to the second equation. So, the x from the first equation is equal to the x from the second equation plus 2. Got it.So, let me denote the solution for x in the first equation as x₁ and in the second as x₂. Then according to the problem, x₁ = x₂ + 2.So, my plan is to solve each equation for x in terms of m, set up the equation x₁ = x₂ + 2, solve for m, and then compute 7m² - 1.Let&#39;s start with the first equation: 5m + 3x = 1 + x.Let&#39;s solve for x:Subtract x from both sides: 5m + 2x = 1Then subtract 5m: 2x = 1 - 5mDivide by 2: x = (1 - 5m)/2So, x₁ = (1 - 5m)/2Now, the second equation: 2x + m = 3mSolve for x:Subtract m from both sides: 2x = 2mDivide by 2: x = mSo, x₂ = mAccording to the problem, x₁ = x₂ + 2. So substituting the expressions we found:(1 - 5m)/2 = m + 2Now, let&#39;s solve this equation for m.Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:1 - 5m = 2(m + 2)Expand the right side: 1 - 5m = 2m + 4Now, bring all terms with m to one side and constants to the other:-5m - 2m = 4 - 1-7m = 3Divide both sides by -7:m = 3 / (-7)m = -3/7So, m is -3/7.Now, we need to compute 7m² - 1.First, compute m squared:(-3/7)² = 9/49Multiply by 7:7*(9/49) = 9/7Subtract 1:9/7 - 1 = 9/7 - 7/7 = 2/7Therefore, 7m² - 1 equals 2/7.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting with solving each equation:First equation:5m + 3x = 1 + xSubtract x: 5m + 2x = 1Subtract 5m: 2x = 1 - 5mDivide by 2: x = (1 - 5m)/2. That seems correct.Second equation:2x + m = 3mSubtract m: 2x = 2mDivide by 2: x = m. Correct.Setting x₁ = x₂ + 2:(1 - 5m)/2 = m + 2Multiply by 2: 1 -5m = 2m +4Then, -5m -2m = 4 -1-7m =3 =&gt; m= -3/7. Correct.Calculating 7m² -1:m² = 9/497*(9/49) = 63/49 = 9/79/7 -1 = 2/7. That seems correct.Hmm, so the answer should be 2/7. Let me check again.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake when moving terms? Let&#39;s verify the equation:1 -5m = 2m +4Bring 2m to the left: 1 -5m -2m =4Which is 1 -7m =4Then, subtract 1: -7m =3Yes, m= -3/7. Correct.So, 7*(-3/7)^2 -1 =7*(9/49) -1 = (63/49) -1 = (63 -49)/49 =14/49=2/7.Yes, that&#39;s right. So 2/7 is the answer.But let me check if the problem perhaps meant m&#39;s solutions? Wait, no. The equations are in both m and x, but in the problem statement, it says &quot;the solution to the equation 5m +3x=1 +x is 2 greater than the solution to the equation 2x +m=3m&quot;.Wait, in each equation, the variable to solve for is probably x, since m is treated as a constant? Wait, but both equations have both variables. So maybe we need to solve for x in terms of m?But the problem says &quot;the solution to the equation...&quot;, so maybe they are considering m as a parameter and x as the variable? So the solution for x in the first equation is 2 greater than the solution for x in the second equation.Yes, that&#39;s how I interpreted it. So solving for x in each equation in terms of m, then setting x₁ = x₂ +2, leading to m= -3/7.Therefore, 7m² -1=2/7. So I think that&#39;s correct. Maybe the answer is 2/7.Alternatively, if m was the variable and x a constant, but that seems less likely since both equations have both variables. But let me check.Wait, if instead, the problem was interpreted as solving each equation for m in terms of x, but that seems odd. Let me check:First equation: 5m +3x =1 +xSolving for m: 5m =1 +x -3x =&gt; 5m=1 -2x =&gt; m=(1 -2x)/5Second equation:2x +m=3m =&gt; 2x=2m =&gt; m=xThen, the solution (for m) to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution (for m) to the second equation.So then, (1 -2x)/5 = x +2But then we would have to solve for x here. But this seems different. Wait, but the problem says &quot;the solution to the equation 5m +3x=1 +x is 2 greater than the solution to the equation 2x +m=3m&quot;. The way it&#39;s phrased is a bit ambiguous.But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;the solution to the equation&quot;, it&#39;s usually referring to solving for the variable. But both equations have two variables. So unless m is a parameter, and x is the variable. Maybe m is a constant, and we are solving for x in both cases. Then, the solutions x₁ and x₂ would be expressions in terms of m, and then the problem is saying x₁ =x₂ +2. That&#39;s how I approached it.Alternatively, if m is the variable and x is a constant, then solving both equations for m would give expressions in terms of x, but then the problem would need to specify which variable&#39;s solution is being referred to.Given that both equations are linear in both variables, but without more context, it&#39;s ambiguous. However, the problem mentions &quot;the solution to the equation&quot;, which in algebra usually refers to solving for the variable. But since both equations have two variables, unless they&#39;re systems of equations. Wait, but each equation is separate. So if they were systems, but the problem only presents two single equations. So perhaps the problem is in the context where m is a constant and x is the variable. That would make sense. Then, for each equation, we solve for x, and set up that the x from the first equation is 2 more than the x from the second equation. Then find m. That&#39;s the only way the problem makes sense, because otherwise, if both variables are free, then there&#39;s not enough information.Therefore, my original approach is correct. So 7m² -1 =2/7. Therefore, the answer is boxed{dfrac{2}{7}}.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{2}{7}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations (5m + 3x = 1 + x) and (2x + m = 3m), we need to find the value of (7m^2 - 1) given that the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation.First, solve each equation for (x) in terms of (m):1. For the equation (5m + 3x = 1 + x):   [   5m + 3x = 1 + x implies 5m + 2x = 1 implies 2x = 1 - 5m implies x = frac{1 - 5m}{2}   ]   Thus, the solution for (x) is (x_1 = frac{1 - 5m}{2}).2. For the equation (2x + m = 3m):   [   2x + m = 3m implies 2x = 2m implies x = m   ]   Thus, the solution for (x) is (x_2 = m).According to the problem, the solution to the first equation is 2 greater than the solution to the second equation:[x_1 = x_2 + 2]Substituting the expressions for (x_1) and (x_2):[frac{1 - 5m}{2} = m + 2]Solving for (m):[1 - 5m = 2(m + 2) implies 1 - 5m = 2m + 4 implies 1 - 7m = 4 implies -7m = 3 implies m = -frac{3}{7}]Now, compute (7m^2 - 1):[m = -frac{3}{7} implies m^2 = left(-frac{3}{7}right)^2 = frac{9}{49}][7m^2 = 7 cdot frac{9}{49} = frac{63}{49} = frac{9}{7}][7m^2 - 1 = frac{9}{7} - 1 = frac{9}{7} - frac{7}{7} = frac{2}{7}]Thus, the value of (7m^2 - 1) is (boxed{dfrac{2}{7}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>To solve the given problem, we follow the steps closely related to the solution provided:1.

We have a problem with different weights: 5 round ones, 2 triangular, and 1 rectangular that&#39;s 90 grams. The goal is to find out how much the triangular weight weighs. First, let me parse the information. There are two balancing equations given. The first one says: 1 round and 1 triangular weight balance 3 round weights. So, if I let R be the weight of a round one and T be the triangular one, then the equation should be R + T = 3R. Because the left side is one round plus one triangular, and the right side is three round weights. Let me write that down:1. R + T = 3RThen the second equation: 4 round weights and 1 triangular weight balance 1 triangular, 1 round, and 1 rectangular weight. So translating that, the left side is 4R + T, and the right side is T + R + 90 grams (since the rectangular is 90 grams). So:2. 4R + T = T + R + 90Hmm. Let me check if I got that right. The second balance: left side is 4 round and 1 triangular, right side is 1 triangular, 1 round, and 1 rectangular. Yes, so substituting variables, yes, 4R + T on the left, and R + T + 90 on the right. Okay, so now let&#39;s solve these equations. Starting with the first equation:From equation 1: R + T = 3RSubtract R from both sides: T = 2RSo the triangular weight is twice the round weight. Got that. So T = 2R.Now let&#39;s plug that into equation 2. Equation 2 is 4R + T = R + T + 90Wait, let&#39;s substitute T with 2R. So replace T with 2R:Left side: 4R + 2R = 6RRight side: R + 2R + 90 = 3R + 90So equation becomes: 6R = 3R + 90Subtract 3R from both sides: 3R = 90Therefore, R = 30 grams.So the round weight is 30 grams. Then, since T = 2R, T = 2*30 = 60 grams.Wait, let me verify. Let&#39;s check both equations with these values.First equation: R + T = 30 + 60 = 90 grams. The right side is 3R = 3*30 = 90 grams. So that checks out.Second equation: Left side 4R + T = 4*30 + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180 grams. Right side is R + T + 90 = 30 + 60 + 90 = 180 grams. That also checks out. Therefore, the triangular weight is 60 grams. But let me just make sure I didn&#39;t misinterpret the problem. The set includes 8 weights: 5 round, 2 triangular, 1 rectangular. The problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about the total number of weights used in the balances, just the equations given. So I think the counts of the set (5,2,1) are just context but not directly needed for the equations. The equations only refer to the specific combinations. So yes, the solution seems correct.So the answer should be 60 grams.Final AnswerThe triangular weight weighs boxed{60} grams.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the weight of the triangular weight. We start by defining the weights: let ( R ) be the weight of a round weight and ( T ) be the weight of a triangular weight. The rectangular weight is given as 90 grams.We are provided with two balancing equations:1. ( 1 ) round weight and ( 1 ) triangular weight balance ( 3 ) round weights:   [   R + T = 3R   ]   Solving this equation, we subtract ( R ) from both sides:   [   T = 2R   ]2. ( 4 ) round weights and ( 1 ) triangular weight balance ( 1 ) triangular weight, ( 1 ) round weight, and ( 1 ) rectangular weight:   [   4R + T = R + T + 90   ]   Substituting ( T = 2R ) into this equation, we get:   [   4R + 2R = R + 2R + 90   ]   Simplifying both sides:   [   6R = 3R + 90   ]   Subtracting ( 3R ) from both sides:   [   3R = 90   ]   Solving for ( R ):   [   R = 30   ]   Using ( T = 2R ):   [   T = 2 times 30 = 60   ]Both equations are verified with ( R = 30 ) grams and ( T = 60 ) grams. Therefore, the weight of the triangular weight is (boxed{60}) grams.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So there&#39;s this problem about balancing weights. We have 8 weights in total: 5 round ones, 2 triangular ones, and 1 rectangular one that&#39;s 90 grams. The question is asking for the weight of the triangular weight. Alright, let&#39;s parse the information step by step.First, they mention two balancing conditions. The first one is that 1 round and 1 triangular weight balance 3 round weights. The second condition is that 4 round weights and 1 triangular weight balance 1 triangular, 1 round, and 1 rectangular weight (which is 90 grams). I need to figure out the weight of the triangular one.Let me denote the weights with variables. Let&#39;s say the round weight is R grams, the triangular one is T grams, and the rectangular one is given as 90 grams. So, R for round, T for triangular, and the rectangular is 90.Now, translating the first condition: 1 round and 1 triangular balance 3 round weights. So in equation form, that would be:R + T = 3RWait, that seems straightforward. If I subtract R from both sides, I get T = 2R. So, does that mean the triangular weight is twice the round weight? Let me check again. If one round plus one triangular equals three round weights, then yes, T must be 2R. Because 1R + 1T = 3R, so subtract 1R from both sides, T = 2R. That seems right.Okay, so triangular is twice the round. So T = 2R. Got that. So if we can find R, then T is just double.Now, moving on to the second condition. 4 round weights and 1 triangular balance 1 triangular, 1 round, and 1 rectangular (90 grams). Let&#39;s write that equation:4R + T = T + R + 90Hmm, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s substitute T with 2R from the first equation. Since T is 2R, replacing T in the second equation:4R + 2R = 2R + R + 90Simplify both sides:Left side: 6RRight side: 3R + 90So, 6R = 3R + 90Subtract 3R from both sides:3R = 90Divide both sides by 3:R = 30So the round weight is 30 grams. Then, since T = 2R, T = 2 * 30 = 60 grams.Wait, let me verify that again. If R is 30, then T is 60. Let&#39;s check both conditions.First condition: 1R + 1T = 30 + 60 = 90. On the other side, 3R = 3*30 = 90. So yes, 90=90, that balances.Second condition: 4R + T = 4*30 + 60 = 120 + 60 = 180. On the other side, T + R + 90 = 60 + 30 + 90 = 180. So 180=180, that also balances. Perfect, both equations check out.Therefore, the triangular weight is 60 grams.But wait, let me make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in substitution. The first equation gives T = 2R. Then in the second equation, substituting T with 2R gives 4R + 2R = 2R + R + 90. That&#39;s 6R = 3R + 90, leading to 3R = 90, so R = 30. Then T = 60. Yep, that seems solid. The answer is 60 grams for the triangular weight.I don&#39;t see any errors here. The key was setting up the equations correctly from the problem statements. Sometimes when problems mention balancing, it&#39;s just setting up the total weights equal on both sides. So translating the words into equations properly is essential. Here, both equations worked out once substituted, and the solution checks out in both scenarios. So I think that&#39;s it.Final AnswerThe triangular weight weighs boxed{60} grams.&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem, we need to determine the weight of the triangular weight. We denote the weight of a round weight as ( R ) grams, the weight of a triangular weight as ( T ) grams, and the rectangular weight is given as 90 grams.First, we translate the given conditions into equations:1. 1 round weight and 1 triangular weight balance 3 round weights:   [   R + T = 3R   ]   Solving this equation, we subtract ( R ) from both sides:   [   T = 2R   ]2. 4 round weights and 1 triangular weight balance 1 triangular weight, 1 round weight, and 1 rectangular weight:   [   4R + T = T + R + 90   ]   Substitute ( T ) with ( 2R ) from the first equation:   [   4R + 2R = 2R + R + 90   ]   Simplifying both sides:   [   6R = 3R + 90   ]   Subtract ( 3R ) from both sides:   [   3R = 90   ]   Solving for ( R ):   [   R = 30   ]Using ( T = 2R ):   [   T = 2 times 30 = 60   ]Both conditions are verified with ( R = 30 ) and ( T = 60 ). Therefore, the weight of the triangular weight is (boxed{60}) grams.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>Answer: 60.Solution.

The problem is asking to arrange the ten digits from 0 to 9 into a ten-digit number without repetition, where the first digit isn&#39;t zero. Then we need to find how many such numbers are divisible by 99. Hmm, okay. Divisible by 99... So, 99 is 9 times 11. I remember that for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. And for divisibility by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11, including zero. So, both conditions need to be satisfied for the number to be divisible by 99. First, let&#39;s check the sum of all digits from 0 to 9. That&#39;s 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9. Let me compute that: (9*10)/2 = 45. Right, so the total sum is 45. Now, 45 divided by 9 is 5, so the sum is divisible by 9. Therefore, any permutation of the digits 0-9 without repetition will automatically satisfy the divisibility by 9 condition because the sum is 45, which is divisible by 9. So, all such numbers are divisible by 9. But we need them also to be divisible by 11. Therefore, the key here is to find how many of these numbers satisfy the divisibility rule for 11.So, the main task is to compute the number of ten-digit numbers using all digits 0-9 once, first digit not zero, such that the alternating sum is a multiple of 11. Let&#39;s recall the divisibility rule for 11: subtract the sum of the digits in the even positions from the sum of the digits in the odd positions, and if the result is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the number is divisible by 11. Let me formalize this. Let’s denote the digits as d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10. Then, the condition is (d1 + d3 + d5 + d7 + d9) - (d2 + d4 + d6 + d8 + d10) ≡ 0 mod 11. Let’s call S_odd = d1 + d3 + d5 + d7 + d9 and S_even = d2 + d4 + d6 + d8 + d10. So, S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11. But since S_odd + S_even = 45, we can write S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11, which implies 2*S_odd ≡ 45 mod 11. Let me check that. If S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11, then S_odd ≡ S_even mod 11. Also, S_odd + S_even = 45. Therefore, adding the two equations: 2*S_odd ≡ 45 mod 11. Let me compute 45 mod 11. 11*4=44, so 45 ≡ 1 mod 11. Therefore, 2*S_odd ≡ 1 mod 11. Then, solving for S_odd, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod 11. The inverse of 2 mod 11 is 6 because 2*6=12≡1 mod11. Therefore, S_odd ≡ 6*1 ≡6 mod11. So, S_odd must be congruent to 6 mod11. But S_odd is the sum of 5 distinct digits from 0-9, and S_even is the sum of the remaining 5 digits. Since the total sum is 45, S_odd can range from, let&#39;s see, minimum sum when we take the smallest five digits: 0+1+2+3+4=10, maximum sum when we take the largest five digits:5+6+7+8+9=35. So S_odd is between 10 and 35. Similarly, S_even would be between 10 and 35 as well. But we need S_odd ≡6 mod11. Let&#39;s find all possible values of S_odd in [10,35] such that S_odd ≡6 mod11. Let&#39;s compute 10 mod11 is 10. Then 10 + (6 -10) mod11 = 6 mod11. So, starting from S_odd=10, adding 11- (10-6)=7? Wait, maybe better to list numbers between 10 and35 that are congruent to 6 mod11. Let&#39;s compute 11k +6 where 11k +6 ≥10 and ≤35. Let&#39;s see:For k=0: 6, which is less than 10.k=1: 17k=2: 28k=3: 39, which is too big. So possible S_odd are 17 and 28. Wait, check that:17 mod11=6, 28 mod11=6 (since 11*2=22, 28-22=6). So yes, 17 and 28 are the values of S_odd that are congruent to 6 mod11 in the range 10-35. Therefore, S_odd must be either 17 or 28.Wait, but 17 is possible? Wait, 17 is S_odd. Then S_even would be 45 -17=28. Similarly, S_odd=28, S_even=17. So these are the two possibilities. Therefore, the possible pairs (S_odd, S_even) are (17,28) and (28,17). Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to partition the digits 0-9 into two groups of five digits each, where one group sums to 17 and the other to 28, and then multiply by the number of valid permutations for each partition.But also, we have to consider that the first digit cannot be zero. So, once we have the partitions, we need to calculate how many valid numbers can be formed from each partition, considering that zero is either in the odd positions or even positions, but the first digit (which is an odd position: position 1) cannot be zero. So, if the partition includes zero in the S_odd group (positions 1,3,5,7,9) or in the S_even group (positions 2,4,6,8,10). But since the first digit is position 1, which is in S_odd, so if zero is in the S_odd group, then we need to subtract the permutations where zero is in the first position. Similarly, if zero is in the S_even group, then all permutations of the S_odd group are valid (since zero cannot be in S_odd in that case). Therefore, the steps are:1. Find all subsets of 5 digits from 0-9 that sum to 17 or 28.2. For each such subset, determine if it includes zero or not.3. For each subset that includes zero, calculate the number of valid permutations where zero is not in the first position (which is part of the S_odd group if the subset is S_odd). Similarly, if the subset is S_even, then zero is in S_even group, so when arranging, zero is in even positions, which do not include the first digit, so it&#39;s allowed.Wait, let&#39;s clarify:Each partition divides digits into two groups: one group of five digits (for S_odd) and another group of five digits (for S_even). The first digit is part of the S_odd group, so if the S_odd group contains zero, then we have to ensure that zero is not placed in the first position. If the S_odd group does not contain zero, then all permutations of the S_odd digits are valid (since none of them are zero). Similarly, the S_even group can contain zero, but since even positions start from position 2, zero is allowed there.Therefore, for each subset S_odd:If S_odd contains zero:- The number of permutations is (number of permutations of S_odd with zero not in first position) * (number of permutations of S_even).Which is: (4 * 4! ) * 5! Wait, wait. Let me think. If S_odd is a group of five digits including zero, then when we arrange the S_odd digits into the five odd positions (positions 1,3,5,7,9), the first digit (position 1) cannot be zero. So, for the first position, we have 4 choices (the non-zero digits in S_odd), and then the remaining 4 digits (including zero) can be arranged in the remaining 4 odd positions in 4! ways. Then, the S_even digits (which are 5 digits, possibly including zero or not) can be arranged in the 5 even positions in 5! ways. So total permutations for this case: 4 * 4! * 5!.If S_odd does not contain zero, then all permutations of the S_odd digits (5 digits, none zero) into the 5 odd positions are valid, since none are zero. So, that&#39;s 5! permutations. Then the S_even group, which must contain zero (since the total digits include zero and S_odd doesn&#39;t have it). But zero can be placed in any of the even positions (positions 2,4,6,8,10), so all permutations of S_even are allowed, which is 5! ways. So, total permutations for this case: 5! * 5!.Therefore, for each subset S_odd:- If S_odd contains zero: 4 * 4! * 5! permutations.- If S_odd does not contain zero: 5! * 5! permutations.But first, we need to find how many subsets S_odd sum to 17 or 28, and whether they include zero or not.So, let&#39;s first find all 5-element subsets of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} that sum to 17 or 28. Then, for each of these subsets, check if they include zero. Then, compute the total number of valid permutations.But first, let&#39;s find all subsets that sum to 17 or 28. Since S_odd can be 17 or 28, but since 28 is just the complement of 17 (because 45 -17=28), the number of subsets that sum to 17 is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 28. Because each subset S that sums to 17 corresponds to its complement S&#39; which sums to 28. Therefore, the number of subsets for S_odd=17 is the same as for S_odd=28.Therefore, if we can find the number of 5-element subsets that sum to 17 (including those with zero and without zero), then the total number would be double that (since each subset corresponds to its complement). Wait, but actually, since S_odd can be either 17 or 28, but each subset is counted once. Wait, actually, maybe not. Let me think again.Wait, if we take all subsets of 5 digits that sum to 17, their complements are subsets of 5 digits that sum to 28. So, the number of subsets that sum to 17 is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 28. Therefore, total number of subsets is 2*N, where N is the number of subsets summing to 17 (including those with zero). Wait, no. The total number of subsets is N (summing to 17) and N&#39; (summing to 28), but since subsets summing to 17 and their complements sum to 28, so N = N&#39;. Therefore, total subsets is 2*N. Wait, no, if you have a subset S summing to 17, then its complement S&#39; sums to 28. So, there is a bijection between subsets summing to 17 and subsets summing to 28. Therefore, the number of subsets summing to 17 is equal to the number of subsets summing to 28. So, total subsets for both is 2*N. Wait, no, actually, if you have N subsets summing to 17, then there are N subsets summing to 28 (their complements). So total subsets is N + N = 2*N. But actually, each subset is counted once either as summing to 17 or 28, but since they are complements, for each subset summing to 17, there is a unique subset summing to 28. Therefore, the total number is 2*N. Wait, maybe not. Let me see. Suppose we have a subset S that sums to 17. Then its complement S&#39; sums to 28. So, for each S, there is a unique S&#39;. So, the number of subsets summing to 17 is equal to the number of subsets summing to 28. Therefore, total number of such subsets is 2*K, where K is the number of unordered pairs {S, S&#39;}. Wait, actually, no. If you count ordered pairs, each subset is either in the 17 group or the 28 group. Since each subset is in one group only, the total number is N + N = 2*N where N is the number in each group. But since each subset is in one group and its complement is in the other, so yes, N = N&#39;, so total is 2*N. But perhaps it&#39;s better not to get confused here. Let&#39;s just compute the number of 5-element subsets that sum to 17, and then we can note that the number of subsets summing to 28 is the same.Therefore, let&#39;s focus on finding the number of 5-element subsets of {0,1,2,...,9} that sum to 17, and also note whether they contain zero or not.This seems like a classic integer partition problem with constraints. However, since the digits are distinct and range from 0-9, we need to consider all combinations of 5 distinct digits that add up to 17. This might be tedious, but maybe there&#39;s a smarter way.Alternatively, perhaps we can use generating functions or recursive counting, but given the time constraints, maybe enumerating them is feasible.Wait, but maybe not too bad. Let&#39;s consider that the digits are 0-9, and we need subsets of 5 distinct digits summing to 17. Let&#39;s denote such subsets as S.First, note that 0 can be part of such subsets. If a subset includes 0, then the remaining four digits must sum to 17, and be selected from 1-9, all distinct. If a subset does not include 0, then all five digits are from 1-9, summing to 17. So, perhaps we can split the counting into two cases: subsets containing 0 and subsets not containing 0.Case 1: Subsets containing 0. Then, the other four digits must be from 1-9, distinct, summing to 17. Let&#39;s compute the number of such subsets.Case 2: Subsets not containing 0. All five digits from 1-9, distinct, summing to 17. Let&#39;s compute the number of such subsets.So, total subsets summing to 17: Case1 + Case2.Similarly, the same approach can be used for subsets summing to 28, but since 28 = 45 -17, the number of subsets summing to 28 is equal to the number of subsets summing to 17, as each subset summing to 17 corresponds to a complement subset summing to 28. But we have to check if this bijection holds when considering subsets with or without zero.Wait, if a subset summing to 17 contains 0, then its complement summing to 28 does not contain 0, since 0 is in the original subset. Similarly, if a subset summing to 17 does not contain 0, its complement summing to 28 does contain 0. Therefore, the number of subsets summing to 17 with 0 is equal to the number of subsets summing to 28 without 0, and vice versa. Therefore, if we compute Case1 (subsets with 0 summing to17) and Case2 (subsets without 0 summing to17), then the total subsets for 17 is Case1 + Case2, and the total subsets for 28 is also Case1 + Case2, but with the roles of 0 swapped. However, since 28 is a larger sum, maybe the count is different? Wait, no. Because when you take complements, subsets summing to 17 containing 0 correspond to subsets summing to 28 not containing 0, and subsets summing to 17 not containing 0 correspond to subsets summing to 28 containing 0. Therefore, the number of subsets summing to 28 with 0 is equal to Case2, and without 0 is equal to Case1. Therefore, total subsets summing to 28 is Case1 + Case2, same as subsets summing to17. Therefore, the total number of valid subsets is 2*(Case1 + Case2). But since each subset is counted once in 17 or 28, actually, the total number of subsets for both is (Case1 + Case2) + (Case1 + Case2) = 2*(Case1 + Case2). But actually, each subset is unique, either in 17 or 28. So, the total number is indeed 2*(Case1 + Case2). However, for our problem, we need to calculate the number of subsets for S_odd. Since S_odd can be 17 or 28, each subset is a valid S_odd if it sums to 17 or 28, but each subset is only counted once. Wait, no. When we are considering S_odd, it can be either 17 or 28. Therefore, the total number of possible S_odd subsets is the number of subsets that sum to 17 plus the number of subsets that sum to 28. Since these are complementary, as we saw, it&#39;s 2*(Case1 + Case2). Therefore, the total number of subsets is double the number of subsets that sum to17. But since we need to consider both 17 and 28, maybe we can just compute the number of subsets summing to17 (Case1 + Case2), then multiply by 2 to account for the subsets summing to28. But actually, no. Because the subsets summing to28 are complements of subsets summing to17. So, if we compute the number of subsets summing to17, then the number of subsets summing to28 is the same. Therefore, total subsets is 2*(number of subsets summing to17). Wait, but this seems contradictory. Let me clarify.Suppose there are N subsets summing to17. Then, there are N subsets summing to28 (each being the complement of a subset summing to17). Therefore, total subsets is N + N = 2N. Therefore, if we can compute N, the number of subsets summing to17, then total subsets is 2N. But in our problem, since S_odd can be either 17 or28, the total number of valid S_odd subsets is 2N. However, when we count the permutations, we have to handle each subset accordingly, whether they contain zero or not. Therefore, let&#39;s proceed step by step.First, compute N = number of subsets of 5 distinct digits from 0-9 summing to17. Let&#39;s compute N as Case1 + Case2, where Case1 includes 0 and Case2 excludes0.Case1: Subsets containing 0. Therefore, the other four digits sum to17, selected from1-9, distinct.So, we need to count the number of 4-element subsets from {1,2,...,9} that sum to17.Case2: Subsets not containing0. Therefore, 5-element subsets from {1,2,...,9} summing to17.Similarly, but since 1-9 are all positive, we can compute these.Let me compute Case1 first: 4-element subsets from1-9 summing to17.This is equivalent to solving a + b + c + d =17, where a,b,c,d are distinct integers from1-9.Similarly, for Case2: 5-element subsets from1-9 summing to17.This is equivalent to a + b + c + d + e =17, with distinct integers from1-9.Now, both of these problems are classic integer partition problems with constraints. However, enumerating all possibilities might be time-consuming, but maybe manageable.Let&#39;s start with Case1: 4 distinct numbers from1-9 summing to17.We need to find all quadruples (a,b,c,d) with 1 ≤ a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d ≤9 and a+b+c+d=17.Similarly, for Case2: 5 distinct numbers from1-9 summing to17.Quintuples (a,b,c,d,e) with 1 ≤a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt;e ≤9 and a+b+c+d+e=17.Let me tackle Case1 first.Case1: 4 numbers from1-9, distinct, sum to17.Possible combinations:The minimal sum for 4 numbers is 1+2+3+4=10.The maximal sum is6+7+8+9=30. So 17 is somewhere in the lower half.To find all combinations, perhaps we can list them systematically.Start with the smallest possible numbers and increase.Start with 1,2,3,11: but 11 is too big. Wait, need four numbers.Let me think. Let&#39;s fix the smallest numbers and find possible larger numbers.Let’s denote the numbers as w &lt; x &lt; y &lt; z, all from1-9, and w + x + y + z =17.Start with w=1:Then x=2, y=3, z=17 -1-2-3=11. But z=11 is invalid (max is9).Therefore, w=1, x=2, y=4, z=10. Still too big.Wait, maybe need a better approach.Alternatively, since they are distinct and ordered, the problem is similar to integer partitions with distinct parts and specific size.Alternatively, use stars and bars with constraints.But perhaps a recursive approach.Wait, maybe I can use generating functions. The generating function for Case1 is (x^1 + x^2 + ... +x^9)^4. We need the coefficient of x^17 in this expansion, which represents the number of ways to choose four numbers (allowing repeats) that sum to17. However, since we need distinct numbers, it&#39;s actually the coefficient of x^17 in the generating function (x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^9)(x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^8)(x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^7)(x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^6). Wait, no. If we take four distinct numbers, the generating function would be the product (x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^9) for the first number, (x^1 +x^2 + ... +x^9 - x^{first number}) for the second, etc. But this gets complicated.Alternatively, use inclusion-exclusion. The number of solutions with distinct numbers is equal to the total number of solutions without repetition constraint minus the ones with at least two numbers equal. But this seems complex.Alternatively, use dynamic programming.But maybe it&#39;s feasible to list them manually.Starting with w=1:1 + 2 + 3 + z =17 ⇒ z=11 invalid.1 + 2 +4 + z=17 ⇒ z=10 invalid.1 +2 +5 +z=17 ⇒ z=9. So {1,2,5,9}. Sum=1+2+5+9=17.1 +2 +6 +z=17 ⇒ z=8. {1,2,6,8}. Sum=17.1 +2 +7 +z=17 ⇒ z=7. But z must be greater than y=7, so z=7 invalid.So next, w=1, x=2, y=3:Already covered. Now, w=1, x=2, y=4:z=10 invalid.Wait, no, let&#39;s fix w=1, x=3:Then y and z.1 +3 + y + z =17 ⇒ y + z=13. With y &gt;3, z &gt; y, and y,z ≤9.Possible y=4, z=9: 4+9=13. So {1,3,4,9}.y=5, z=8: {1,3,5,8}.y=6, z=7: {1,3,6,7}.y=7, z=6 invalid.So three combinations here.Next, w=1, x=4:1 +4 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=12. y&gt;4, z&gt;y.y=5, z=7: {1,4,5,7}.y=6, z=6 invalid.So only one combination here.w=1, x=5:1 +5 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=11. y&gt;5, z&gt;y.Possible y=6, z=5 invalid. y=5 is not greater than x=5. Wait, x=5, y&gt;5.Wait, y must be greater than x=5. So y ≥6, then z=11 - y.y=6, z=5 invalid (z must be &gt; y=6). y=7, z=4 invalid. So no solutions here.Similarly, w=1, x=6: 1 +6 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=10. y&gt;6, so y≥7, z≥8. y=7, z=3 invalid. No solutions.Thus, for w=1, we have:{1,2,5,9}, {1,2,6,8}, {1,3,4,9}, {1,3,5,8}, {1,3,6,7}, {1,4,5,7}. That&#39;s 6 subsets.Now, w=2:Similarly, start with w=2.2 + x + y + z=17 ⇒ x + y + z=15. x&gt;2, y&gt; x, z&gt; y.Start with x=3:2 +3 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=12. y&gt;3, z&gt; y.Possible y=4, z=8: {2,3,4,8}.y=5, z=7: {2,3,5,7}.y=6, z=6 invalid.x=4:2 +4 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=11. y&gt;4, z&gt; y.y=5, z=6: {2,4,5,6}.y=6, z=5 invalid.x=5:2 +5 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=10. y&gt;5, z&gt; y.y=6, z=4 invalid. No solutions.x=3: already covered.x=4: covered.x=5: no solutions.Thus, for w=2, subsets are {2,3,4,8}, {2,3,5,7}, {2,4,5,6}. That&#39;s 3 subsets.w=3:3 +x + y + z=17 ⇒x + y + z=14. x&gt;3.x=4:3 +4 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=10. y&gt;4, z&gt; y.Possible y=5, z=5 invalid. y=6, z=4 invalid. No solutions.x=5:3 +5 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=9. y&gt;5, z&gt; y. No solutions.x=6:3 +6 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=8. y&gt;6, z&gt; y. No solutions.Thus, no subsets with w=3.Wait, hold on. Wait, starting with w=3:Wait, x must be greater than 3. Let&#39;s check again:3 +4 +5 +z=17 ⇒ z=5, which is not greater than 5. So no.Alternatively, x=4, y=5, z=14 -4 -5=5, which is invalid.x=4, y=6, z=14 -4 -6=4 invalid. So indeed, no subsets with w=3.Similarly, w=4:4 +x + y + z=17 ⇒x + y + z=13. x&gt;4.x=5:4 +5 + y + z=17 ⇒y + z=8. y&gt;5, z&gt; y.y=6, z=2 invalid. No solutions.x=6:4 +6 + y + z=17 ⇒ y + z=7. y&gt;6, z&gt; y. No solutions.Thus, no subsets with w=4 or higher.Therefore, total Case1 subsets: 6 (for w=1) +3 (for w=2) =9.Wait, let&#39;s count again:From w=1: {1,2,5,9}, {1,2,6,8}, {1,3,4,9}, {1,3,5,8}, {1,3,6,7}, {1,4,5,7} →6 subsets.From w=2: {2,3,4,8}, {2,3,5,7}, {2,4,5,6} →3 subsets.Total Case1:9 subsets.Now, Case2: 5-element subsets from1-9, summing to17.So, need to find all quintuples (a,b,c,d,e) with 1 ≤a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt;e ≤9 and a+b+c+d+e=17.This is more complicated, but let&#39;s try.The minimal sum for 5 distinct numbers from1-9 is 1+2+3+4+5=15.Next minimal sums:16 (1+2+3+4+6), 17 (1+2+3+4+7; 1+2+3+5+6). So possible combinations.Let’s list them.Start with a=1:1 +2 +3 +4 +7=171 +2 +3 +5 +6=17Are there others with a=1?Check:1 +2 +3 +4 +7=171 +2 +3 +5 +6=17Next, 1 +2 +4 +5 +5=17, but duplicates.1 +2 +3 +6 +5=17 same as previous.1 +2 +4 +5 +5 invalid.Next possibility: 1 +2 +3 +4 +8=18 too big.So, only two subsets with a=1.Now, check a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7; and a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6.Next, a=1, b=2, c=4:1 +2 +4 +d +e=17 ⇒d +e=10. d&gt;4, e&gt;d, d,e ≤9.Possible d=5, e=5 invalid. d=6, e=4 invalid. So no solutions.a=1, b=2, c=5:1 +2 +5 +d +e=17 ⇒d +e=9. d&gt;5, so d≥6, e&gt;d. 6+3=9 invalid. So no solutions.a=1, b=3:1 +3 +c +d +e=17 ⇒c +d +e=13. With c&gt;3.Let’s take c=4:1 +3 +4 +d +e=17 ⇒d +e=9. d&gt;4, e&gt;d.Possible d=5, e=4 invalid. No solutions.c=5:1 +3 +5 +d +e=17 ⇒d +e=8. d&gt;5, e&gt;d. d≥6, e≥7. 6+2=8 invalid. No solutions.Similarly, a=1, b=4:1 +4 +c +d +e=17 ⇒c +d +e=12. c&gt;4. Not likely.c=5: 1 +4 +5 +d +e=17 ⇒d +e=7. d&gt;5. No.So no subsets with a=1, b=4 or higher.Now, a=2:Start with a=2.The minimal sum with a=2 is 2+3+4+5+6=20, which is already above17. So no subsets with a=2 or higher can sum to17.Wait, wait. Wait, the minimal sum for a=2 is 2+3+4+5+6=20. But 20&gt;17, so it&#39;s impossible to have a subset with a=2 or higher that sums to17. Therefore, the only subsets in Case2 are the two we found with a=1.Therefore, Case2 has 2 subsets.Therefore, total subsets summing to17: Case1 (9) + Case2 (2) =11 subsets.Wait, but let&#39;s check again.For Case2, we found two subsets:{1,2,3,4,7} and {1,2,3,5,6}. Are there any more?Let me check again.Suppose a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7: sum=17.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6: sum=17.Any other combinations? For example, a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5 invalid. a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4 invalid. So no. So indeed, only two subsets.Therefore, total N=Case1 +Case2=9+2=11 subsets.Therefore, total number of subsets summing to17 is11. Then, the number of subsets summing to28 is also11, since each subset summing to17 corresponds to a complement subset summing to28. Therefore, total number of valid S_odd subsets is11 (for 17) +11 (for28)=22.But wait, no. Because each subset is counted either in17 or28. Since S_odd can be17 or28, the total number of valid subsets is22. But we need to check whether these subsets include zero or not. Let&#39;s analyze.For subsets summing to17 (Case1 and Case2):- Case1: subsets containing0 (summing to17). There are9 such subsets.- Case2: subsets not containing0 (summing to17). There are2 such subsets.Therefore, their complements:Subsets summing to28 are complements of subsets summing to17. Therefore:- Complements of Case1 subsets (which include0) are subsets not containing0, summing to28.- Complements of Case2 subsets (not containing0) are subsets containing0, summing to28.Therefore, the number of subsets summing to28 containing0 is equal to the number of subsets summing to17 not containing0, which is2.Similarly, the number of subsets summing to28 not containing0 is equal to the number of subsets summing to17 containing0, which is9.Therefore, total subsets for S_odd:- Summing to17:9 (with0) +2 (without0)=11.- Summing to28:2 (with0) +9 (without0)=11.Therefore, total subsets:11 +11=22.But when considering S_odd, we need to separate whether they include0 or not because the permutation counts differ.Now, for each subset S_odd:If S_odd sums to17 and contains0 (Case1, 9 subsets):Each such subset corresponds to permutations where S_odd includes0, so we need to calculate 4 *4! *5!.If S_odd sums to17 and does not contain0 (Case2,2 subsets):These correspond to S_odd subsets not containing0, so permutations are5! *5!.Similarly, subsets summing to28:If S_odd sums to28 and contains0 (these are complements of Case2 subsets, so2 subsets):Each such subset corresponds to permutations where S_odd includes0, so same as above:4 *4! *5!.If S_odd sums to28 and does not contain0 (complements of Case1 subsets,9 subsets):These correspond to permutations where S_odd doesn&#39;t include0, so5! *5!.Therefore, total permutations:For subsets summing to17 with0:9 *4 *4! *5!.For subsets summing to17 without0:2 *5! *5!.For subsets summing to28 with0:2 *4 *4! *5!.For subsets summing to28 without0:9 *5! *5!.Therefore, total permutations= (9 +2)*4 *4! *5! + (2 +9)*5! *5!.Wait, actually, no. Wait:Total permutations:Summing to17:- 9 subsets with0: each contributes4*4! *5!.- 2 subsets without0: each contributes5! *5!.Summing to28:-2 subsets with0: each contributes4*4! *5!.-9 subsets without0: each contributes5! *5!.Therefore, total permutations= [9*4*4! *5! +2*5! *5!] + [2*4*4! *5! +9*5! *5!] = (9*4 +2*4)*4! *5! + (2 +9)*5! *5!.Wait:Summing terms with0:(9 +2)*4*4! *5!.Summing terms without0:(2 +9)*5! *5!.So total permutations=11*4*4! *5! +11*5! *5!.Factor out11*5! *4!:Wait, 4*4! =4! *4.Wait, 4*4! =4*24=96.5! =120.But let&#39;s compute:First term:11*4*4! *5! =11*4*(24)*(120)=11*4*24*120.Second term:11*5! *5! =11*(120)*(120)=11*120*120.Compute these:First term:11*4*24*120.4*24=96, 96*120=11520, 11*11520=126720.Second term:11*120*120=11*14400=158400.Total permutations=126720 +158400=285,120.Therefore, the total number of valid ten-digit numbers is285,120.But wait, let me verify the calculation:First term:11 *4*4! *5!.4! is24, 5! is120.So:11 *4 *24 *120.4*24=96, 96*120=11,520. 11*11,520=126,720.Second term:11 *5! *5! =11*(120*120)=11*14,400=158,400.Adding them together:126,720 +158,400=285,120.Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the number of ten-digit numbers using all digits0-9 once, first digit not zero, divisible by99 is285,120.However, wait a second. Let me check if there are any mistakes in the logic.First, we assumed that the number of subsets summing to17 is11. But let&#39;s confirm the enumeration.For Case1: subsets containing0 and four digits from1-9 summing to17. We found9 subsets.Listing them again:From w=1:{1,2,5,9}{1,2,6,8}{1,3,4,9}{1,3,5,8}{1,3,6,7}{1,4,5,7}From w=2:{2,3,4,8}{2,3,5,7}{2,4,5,6}Total9 subsets. Correct.For Case2: subsets not containing0, five digits from1-9 summing to17. We found two subsets:{1,2,3,4,7}{1,2,3,5,6}Is that correct? Let&#39;s check if there are any other possible subsets.Wait, suppose we have a subset with a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7=17.Another one is a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6=17.What about a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5? No, duplicates. a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4? Duplicates. No, seems only those two.Therefore, Case2 is indeed2 subsets. Therefore, total subsets summing to17 is11. Therefore, the calculation is correct.Therefore, the total permutations are285,120. Therefore, the answer is285,120, which can be written as boxed{285120}.Final Answerboxed{285120}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of arranging the ten digits from 0 to 9 into a ten-digit number without repetition, with the first digit not being zero, and divisible by 99, we need to consider the divisibility rules for 9 and 11. 1. Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of digits 0-9 is 45, which is divisible by 9.2. Divisibility by 11: The alternating sum of the digits (S_odd - S_even) must be a multiple of 11. Given the total sum of digits is 45, we need S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11. This translates to 2*S_odd ≡ 45 mod 11, leading to S_odd ≡ 6 mod 11. The possible values for S_odd are 17 and 28.Key Steps:1. Sum Calculation: The sum of all digits (0-9) is 45. For divisibility by 11, we need S_odd - S_even ≡ 0 mod 11. This results in S_odd ≡ 6 mod 11, leading to S_odd values of 17 and 28.2. Finding Valid Subsets:   - Case 1 (Sum 17 with 0): 9 subsets.   - Case 2 (Sum 17 without 0): 2 subsets.   - Complementary subsets (Sum 28): 11 subsets each for sums 17 and 28, leading to 22 subsets in total.3. Permutations:   - Subsets containing 0 contribute 4 * 4! * 5! permutations.   - Subsets without 0 contribute 5! * 5! permutations.Calculations:- For subsets containing 0: ( 11 times 4 times 4! times 5! = 126,720 )- For subsets without 0: ( 11 times 5! times 5! = 158,400 )Total Permutations: ( 126,720 + 158,400 = 285,120 )Thus, the number of valid ten-digit numbers is (boxed{285120}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out how many ten-digit numbers using all the digits 0 through 9 exactly once (without repetition) are divisible by 99. Also, the first digit can&#39;t be zero. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some math concepts related to divisibility by 99.First, 99 is 9 times 11, right? So if a number is divisible by both 9 and 11, then it&#39;s divisible by 99. That seems like a good starting point. So, I need to find all ten-digit pandigital numbers (using each digit once) that satisfy the divisibility rules for both 9 and 11.Let me remember the divisibility rules for 9 and 11. For 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. For 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11, including zero.Okay, let&#39;s start with the divisibility by 9. The sum of all digits from 0 to 9 is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45. Since 45 is divisible by 9 (45 ÷ 9 = 5), every ten-digit number that uses all digits 0-9 exactly once will automatically satisfy the divisibility rule for 9. That means every pandigital number is divisible by 9. So, actually, the only restriction here is the divisibility by 11. So, the problem reduces to finding how many ten-digit pandigital numbers (with first digit non-zero) are divisible by 11.Alright, now focusing on the divisibility by 11. Let me recall the rule again: subtract the sum of the digits in the even positions from the sum of the digits in the odd positions. If the result is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the number is divisible by 11.So, let&#39;s denote the positions as 1st, 2nd, ..., 10th digit. Positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are the odd positions, and positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are even. Let me calculate the required difference.Let S_odd be the sum of digits in odd positions, S_even be the sum in even positions. Then S_odd - S_even must be a multiple of 11. Since the total sum S_odd + S_even = 45, we can write S_odd = 45 - S_even. Therefore, substituting into the first equation: (45 - S_even) - S_even = 45 - 2*S_even must be divisible by 11. Let&#39;s denote this difference as D = 45 - 2*S_even.So, D must be a multiple of 11. Let&#39;s compute possible values of D. The possible values for D can be calculated by knowing that S_even can range from the minimum sum of its digits to the maximum. Since there are 5 even positions, each digit from 0-9 used once. The minimum sum S_even can be is 0+1+2+3+4=10, and the maximum sum is 5+6+7+8+9=35. Therefore, D can range from 45 - 2*35 = 45 -70 = -25 to 45 - 2*10 = 45 -20 =25. So D can be between -25 and 25. The multiples of 11 in this range are: -22, -11, 0, 11, 22. So D can be -22, -11, 0, 11, 22.But let&#39;s check if these are possible. Let&#39;s compute 45 - 2*S_even = D, so S_even = (45 - D)/2. Since S_even must be an integer (sum of integers), (45 - D)/2 must be integer, so 45 - D must be even. Therefore, D must be odd. Wait, 45 is odd. So odd minus D must be even, so D must be odd. But the multiples of 11 we have in the range are -22, -11, 0, 11, 22. Let&#39;s check which of these are odd. 45 - (-22) = 67, which is odd, so (45 - (-22))/2 = 67/2 = 33.5, which is not integer. Similarly, D = -11: 45 - (-11) =56, 56/2=28, which is integer. D=0: 45 -0=45, 45/2=22.5, not integer. D=11: 45 -11=34, 34/2=17, integer. D=22: 45 -22=23, 23/2=11.5, not integer. So the possible D values are only -11 and 11. Because those are the ones where (45 - D) is even.Wait, let&#39;s check again. For D=-22: (45 - (-22))/2=67/2=33.5, not integer. D=-11: 45 - (-11)=56, 56/2=28. D=0: 45/2=22.5, nope. D=11: 45-11=34, 34/2=17. D=22: 45-22=23, 23/2=11.5. So only D=-11 and D=11 lead to integer S_even. Therefore, the possible S_even values are 28 and 17. Therefore, S_even must be either 28 or 17. Then S_odd would be 45 -28=17 or 45 -17=28. So, depending on whether S_even is 28 or 17.Therefore, the problem reduces to: count the number of ten-digit pandigital numbers (first digit non-zero) where the sum of the digits in the even positions is 17 or 28. Then sum those two counts.Wait, but hold on. S_even can be 17 or 28. So, our job is to compute the number of ways to choose 5 distinct digits (since even positions are 5 digits) with sum 17 or 28, and the remaining 5 digits (the odd positions) will have sum 28 or 17, respectively. Then, for each such partition, we need to count the number of permutations where the first digit is non-zero.But first, we need to compute how many ways to split the digits 0-9 into two groups of 5 digits each, one group for even positions and the other for odd positions, such that the sum of the even group is 17 or 28. Then, for each such split, we can compute the number of valid permutations (arrangements where the first digit is non-zero).But before that, perhaps we should check whether such splits (with sums 17 and 28) are possible. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s first consider S_even=17. So, we need to choose 5 distinct digits from 0-9 that sum to 17. Similarly, S_even=28: 5 distinct digits summing to 28.But wait, 28 is a larger sum, so we need to see if there are 5 distinct digits adding up to 28. Similarly for 17.First, let&#39;s check possible combinations.For sum=17:We need 5 distinct digits from 0-9 summing to 17. Let&#39;s think of the minimal and maximal possible sums for 5 digits. The minimal sum is 0+1+2+3+4=10, the maximal sum is 5+6+7+8+9=35. So 17 is within this range. Similarly, 28 is also within this range.But let&#39;s check if there are combinations for these sums.For sum=17: Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s find all 5-element subsets of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with sum 17.Similarly, for sum=28: 5-element subsets with sum 28.But this is going to be tedious. Maybe there&#39;s a symmetry here. Since the total sum is 45, if a subset of 5 digits sums to 17, then the complementary subset (the other 5 digits) will sum to 45-17=28. Therefore, the number of subsets with sum 17 is equal to the number of subsets with sum 28. Because each subset corresponds to its complement. So, if we can find the number of subsets with sum 17, that would automatically give us the number of subsets with sum 28.Therefore, we only need to compute the number of 5-element subsets summing to 17 (which would be equal to the number of subsets summing to 28). Then, the total number of subsets is double that. Wait, no. Wait, each subset with sum 17 corresponds to a unique complement subset with sum 28, so the count of subsets with sum 17 is equal to the count with sum 28. Therefore, if we compute N subsets with sum 17, then there are also N subsets with sum 28. Therefore, the total number of such subsets is 2N. Wait, no. Each subset is counted once. If you have a subset S with sum 17, its complement has sum 28. So the number of subsets with sum 17 is equal to the number of subsets with sum 28. So, if N is the number of 5-element subsets with sum 17, then the total number of subsets that satisfy the sum condition is 2N? Wait, no. If each subset with sum 17 corresponds to a unique subset with sum 28, then the number of such subsets is equal. So N = number of subsets with sum 17 = number of subsets with sum 28. Therefore, total subsets for both sums would be N + N = 2N. But I need to confirm if this is indeed the case.But actually, since each subset with sum 17 has a complement with sum 28, and vice versa. So the number of subsets with sum 17 is equal to the number with sum 28. Therefore, if we compute N subsets for sum 17, then there are N subsets for sum 28. So total subsets is N + N = 2N. But that would be only if subsets are considered in both directions. Wait, but for each subset, there is one complement. So if we have a subset S with sum 17, then its complement has sum 28. Therefore, the count is the same. So if there are N subsets for sum 17, there are N subsets for sum 28. Therefore, total number of valid subsets is N + N = 2N. But in reality, each subset is paired with another, so the total number of subsets is 2N? Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose there are N subsets with sum 17. Then each of those subsets corresponds to a unique complement subset with sum 28. Therefore, the number of subsets with sum 28 is N. Therefore, the total number of subsets is N (for sum 17) + N (for sum 28) = 2N. But actually, each subset is either counted in sum 17 or sum 28, but not both. Wait, no. If a subset has sum 17, its complement has sum 28, so each subset is in one category or the other, so the total number of subsets that satisfy either sum 17 or sum 28 is 2N. But since the total number of 5-element subsets is C(10,5)=252. So unless 2N=252, which is not the case. But in reality, most subsets don&#39;t sum to 17 or 28. So N is some number, and 2N is the number of subsets that are in complementary pairs. So the rest of the subsets (252 - 2N) don&#39;t have their complement in the same set. Wait, but actually, every subset has a complement. So if a subset has sum S, its complement has sum 45 - S. Therefore, the number of subsets with sum S is equal to the number with sum 45 - S. Therefore, in our case, since we are looking at sums 17 and 28, which are complementary (17 +28=45), the number of subsets with sum 17 equals the number with sum 28. Therefore, we just need to compute N = number of 5-element subsets with sum 17, and then total valid subsets is 2N. Wait, but in our problem, we need to consider subsets for both 17 and 28, so the total number of valid subsets is N + N = 2N. But when actually, subsets for 17 and 28 are different, but each subset for 17 corresponds to one for 28, so the counts are equal.Therefore, in order to compute the total number of valid splits (even positions sum 17 or 28), we need to compute the number of 5-element subsets with sum 17, then multiply by 2. But actually, no. Because once we compute the number of subsets with sum 17, that is equal to the number with sum 28. So the total number is 2 * N.But perhaps to avoid confusion, let&#39;s just compute N, the number of 5-element subsets with sum 17. Then the total number is N (for sum 17) + N (for sum 28) = 2N. Wait, but no, the number of subsets for sum 17 is N, and the number for sum 28 is also N (because each subset with sum 17 has a complement with sum 28). Therefore, the total number is N + N = 2N. But since each subset is counted once in either sum 17 or sum 28, but we have to be careful. For example, if a subset with sum 17 is considered, its complement is considered in sum 28. Therefore, if we count all subsets with sum 17 and all with sum 28, we are double-counting? Wait, no. Each subset is counted only once. Because a subset is either in the sum 17 group or the sum 28 group, but not both. Because a subset cannot have both sum 17 and 28. So if I compute the number of subsets with sum 17, and the number with sum 28, since these are two distinct groups, the total number is N + N&#39;, where N is the number for sum 17 and N&#39; is the number for sum 28. But since N = N&#39;, then total is 2N. So, okay, we need to compute N = number of 5-element subsets of {0,...,9} summing to 17. Then total subsets is 2N. Then, for each such subset, we need to compute the number of permutations where the even positions are assigned the subset&#39;s digits, and the odd positions are assigned the remaining digits, with the first digit (which is an odd position) not being zero.Therefore, the total number of valid numbers would be 2N multiplied by the number of valid permutations per subset.Wait, but actually, for each subset S (sum 17) assigned to even positions, we can permute the digits in the even positions (5! ways) and permute the digits in the odd positions (5! ways). However, we need to ensure that the first digit (which is in an odd position) is not zero. Similarly, for the subsets with sum 28 assigned to even positions, same thing.But since the first digit is in the first position (odd position), which is part of the odd position digits. So regardless of whether the even positions sum to 17 or 28, the odd positions will contain 5 digits (including possibly zero). Therefore, in each case, we need to count the number of permutations where the odd positions are arranged such that the first digit is not zero.Therefore, the total number of valid numbers would be:For each subset S (sum 17 or 28) assigned to even positions:- The even positions can be arranged in 5! ways.- The odd positions consist of the remaining 5 digits. These can be arranged in 5! ways, but we have to subtract the number of permutations where the first digit (position 1) is zero.So, the number of valid permutations for the odd positions is 5! - 4! = (120 - 24) = 96. Because if the first digit is zero, the remaining 4 digits can be arranged in 4! ways.Therefore, for each subset S (whether sum 17 or 28), the number of valid numbers is 5! * (5! - 4!) = 120 * 96 = 11520.But wait, is that right? Wait, the even positions can be arranged in 5! ways, and the odd positions can be arranged in 5! ways, but with the constraint that the first digit (an odd position) is non-zero. However, the odd positions include the first digit and other positions. So actually, the odd positions are 5 digits, which may include zero or not. Wait, if the odd positions contain zero, then arranging them such that zero is not in the first position. If the odd positions don&#39;t contain zero, then all permutations are allowed.But in our case, the digits 0-9 are split into two groups: 5 digits in even positions and 5 digits in odd positions. So whether zero is in the even group or the odd group depends on the subset S.Wait, this is a critical point. If the subset S (assigned to even positions) contains zero, then the odd positions do not contain zero, so all permutations of the odd positions are allowed (since even if zero is in even positions, the first digit is in odd positions, which don&#39;t have zero). Conversely, if the subset S does not contain zero, then the odd positions must contain zero, and we need to subtract permutations where zero is in the first position.Therefore, depending on whether the subset S (even positions) includes zero or not, the number of valid permutations for the odd positions will vary.Therefore, we need to split the subsets S into two categories:1. Subsets S (sum 17 or 28) that include zero. For these, the odd positions do not contain zero, so all 5! permutations of odd positions are allowed.2. Subsets S that do not include zero. For these, the odd positions contain zero, so the number of valid permutations is 5! - 4! = 96.Therefore, we need to compute:For each subset S (sum 17 or 28):If S includes zero, then number of valid numbers = 5! (even permutations) * 5! (odd permutations).If S does not include zero, then number of valid numbers = 5! (even permutations) * (5! - 4!) (odd permutations).Therefore, the total number of valid numbers is:(Number of subsets S including zero) * 5! * 5! + (Number of subsets S excluding zero) * 5! * (5! - 4!)).But since we have two cases for S: sum 17 and sum 28, we need to compute for both sums. However, remember that subsets with sum 17 and subsets with sum 28 are complements. So, if a subset S has sum 17 and includes zero, then its complement (sum 28) will exclude zero. Similarly, if a subset S has sum 17 and excludes zero, its complement includes zero.Wait, let&#39;s verify that. Let&#39;s suppose subset S (even positions) has sum 17 and includes zero. Then the complement subset (odd positions) has sum 28 and excludes zero. Conversely, if subset S has sum 17 and excludes zero, the complement subset has sum 28 and includes zero. Therefore, for the two sums (17 and 28), the inclusion/exclusion of zero is complementary. So, if N1 is the number of subsets with sum 17 including zero, then the number of subsets with sum 28 excluding zero is also N1. Similarly, if N2 is the number of subsets with sum 17 excluding zero, then the number of subsets with sum 28 including zero is N2.But since the total number of subsets with sum 17 is N1 + N2, and the total with sum 28 is also N1 + N2 (since subsets correspond to their complements), then the total valid numbers would be:For sum 17 subsets:- If S includes zero: N1 * 5! * 5! (even permutations * odd permutations, since odd positions don&#39;t have zero)- If S excludes zero: N2 * 5! * (5! - 4!) (even permutations * odd permutations minus those starting with zero)For sum 28 subsets:- If S includes zero: N2 * 5! * 5! (since sum 28 subsets that include zero correspond to sum 17 subsets that exclude zero, hence N2)- If S excludes zero: N1 * 5! * (5! - 4!) (since sum 28 subsets that exclude zero correspond to sum 17 subsets that include zero, hence N1)Therefore, total number of valid numbers is:[N1 * 5! * 5! + N2 * 5! * (5! - 4!)] + [N2 * 5! * 5! + N1 * 5! * (5! - 4!)] =Factor out 5!:5! * [N1 * 5! + N2 * (5! - 4!) + N2 * 5! + N1 * (5! - 4!)] =5! * [ (N1 + N2) * 5! + (N1 + N2) * (5! - 4!) ) ] Wait, no. Let me do the math step by step.First term: N1*120*120 + N2*120*96Second term: N2*120*120 + N1*120*96Total: N1*120*120 + N2*120*96 + N2*120*120 + N1*120*96Factor out 120:120*(N1*120 + N2*96 + N2*120 + N1*96) =120*(N1*(120 + 96) + N2*(96 + 120)) =120*(N1*216 + N2*216) =120*216*(N1 + N2) = 120*216*N_total, where N_total = N1 + N2 = total number of subsets with sum 17 (which is equal to total subsets with sum 28, but N1 + N2 is the number for sum 17).But wait, N_total is the number of subsets with sum 17, which we already established is equal to the number with sum 28, so 2*N_total would be the total subsets for both sums. But in our problem, since each subset S (sum 17 or 28) corresponds to a unique arrangement, but in the calculation above, we already considered both sums. Wait, no. Wait, the above calculation seems to have considered both sums. Wait, the first term was for sum 17 subsets and the second term for sum 28 subsets, each contributing based on whether they include zero or not. Therefore, total N1 + N2 is the number of subsets with sum 17, which equals the number of subsets with sum 28. Therefore, the total becomes 120*216*(N1 + N2). But N1 + N2 is the total number of subsets with sum 17, which is equal to the number with sum 28, so the total number of such subsets is 2*(N1 + N2). Wait, no. Wait, no. For sum 17, there are N1 + N2 subsets. For sum 28, same. So total subsets is 2*(N1 + N2). But in our calculation above, we have already combined both sums. Wait, but in our expression, N1 is the number of subsets with sum 17 including zero, N2 is the number with sum 17 excluding zero. Then the sum 28 subsets would be N1&#39; = number with sum 28 including zero = N2 (since the complement of a sum 17 subset excluding zero is a sum 28 subset including zero), and N2&#39; = number with sum 28 excluding zero = N1. Therefore, when we calculate the total contributions from both sum 17 and sum 28 subsets, we get:Sum17: N1*120*120 + N2*120*96Sum28: N2*120*120 + N1*120*96Total: (N1 + N2)*120*120 + (N1 + N2)*120*96 = (N1 + N2)*120*(120 + 96) = (N1 + N2)*120*216Therefore, the total number of valid numbers is 120*216*(N1 + N2). But (N1 + N2) is the number of subsets with sum 17 (which equals the number with sum 28). Let me denote T = N1 + N2. Then total numbers = 120*216*T.Therefore, we need to compute T, which is the number of 5-element subsets of {0,1,...,9} that sum to 17. Then multiply by 120*216.So now, the key is to compute T. Let&#39;s compute T.So, T is the number of 5-element subsets of {0,1,...,9} that sum to 17. Let&#39;s find all combinations.This is a combinatorial problem. Let&#39;s find all 5-element subsets of the digits 0-9 without repetition that add up to 17.To compute this, perhaps we can use generating functions or recursive counting, but since it&#39;s manageable, maybe we can list them.But listing all possible subsets might be time-consuming. Let&#39;s see.We need to choose 5 distinct digits from 0-9 summing to 17. Let&#39;s approach this step by step.First, note that 0 can be included or excluded. Let&#39;s split into two cases: subsets including 0 and subsets not including 0.Case 1: Subsets including 0. Then we need to choose 4 more digits from 1-9, summing to 17 - 0 = 17. So sum of 4 digits =17.Case 2: Subsets not including 0. Then we need to choose 5 digits from 1-9, summing to 17.Therefore, T = T1 + T2, where T1 is the number of 5-element subsets including 0 summing to17, and T2 is the number of 5-element subsets excluding 0 summing to17.First, compute T1:Case1: 0 + four digits from 1-9 summing to 17.So, find the number of 4-element subsets of {1,...,9} summing to17.Similarly, for T2: 5-element subsets of {1,...,9} summing to17.Let me compute T1 first.T1: Number of 4-element subsets of {1,...,9} with sum 17.Let&#39;s think of the possible combinations. The minimal sum of 4 digits from 1-9 is 1+2+3+4=10, the maximal is 6+7+8+9=30. So 17 is within this range.Let’s try to list them.Possible 4-element subsets (a,b,c,d), a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d, a &gt;=1, sum=17.Start with the smallest possible first digit.Start with a=1:Then b + c + d = 17 -1 =16, with b &gt;=2, c &gt;=3, d &gt;=4.Wait, but since a=1, then b &gt;=2, c &gt;=3, d &gt;=4. But since they must be distinct and in increasing order.So, b &gt;=2, c &gt;= b+1, d &gt;=c+1.So, the problem reduces to finding the number of triples (b,c,d) with 2 &lt;= b &lt; c &lt; d &lt;=9 such that b + c + d =16.Similarly, perhaps it&#39;s easier to list all possible quadruples.But this could take a while. Alternatively, use stars and bars with constraints.But stars and bars isn&#39;t straightforward here because of the distinctness and ordering.Alternatively, perhaps use recursive counting.Alternatively, use generating functions.The generating function for the sum of 4 distinct digits from 1 to 9 is:(x^1 + x^2 + ... + x^9) * (x^{1+1} + x^{2+1} + ... + x^{9+1}) ... but this is getting complex.Alternatively, use dynamic programming. But since it&#39;s a small case, maybe proceed manually.Start with a=1, then we need b + c + d =16, where 2 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;d &lt;=9.Possible combinations:Let’s list possible triples (b,c,d):Start with the largest possible d:d=9: Then b + c =16 -9=7. With b &gt;=2, c &gt;=b+1 &lt;= c &lt;=8.Possible (b,c) pairs: (2,5), (3,4). Because 2 +5=7, 3+4=7. But check if c &lt; d=9: yes. So two triples: (2,5,9), (3,4,9)d=8: Then b + c =16 -8=8. With b &gt;=2, c &gt;=b+1, c &lt;=7.Possible (b,c) pairs: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4) but duplicates not allowed. So (2,6,8), (3,5,8)d=7: Then b + c =16 -7=9. With b &gt;=2, c &gt;=b+1 &lt;=6.Possible pairs: (2,7) but c &lt;=6, so invalid. (3,6), (4,5). So (3,6,7), (4,5,7)d=6: Then b + c =16 -6=10. With b &gt;=2, c &gt;=b+1 &lt;=5. But c &lt;=5, so b + c &lt;=2 +5=7 &lt;10. Not possible.d=5: Then b + c =16 -5=11. But c &lt;=4, so impossible.Similarly, d=4 or lower: impossible.Therefore, for a=1, the possible triples are:(2,5,9), (3,4,9), (2,6,8), (3,5,8), (3,6,7), (4,5,7). That is 6 subsets.So T1 when a=1 is 6.Next, a=2:Then b + c + d =17 -2=15, with b &gt;=3, c &gt;=4, d &gt;=5.Wait, no. Wait, a=2, then the next digits must be greater than 2. So b &gt;=3, c &gt;=4, d &gt;=5.Wait, but actually, the digits must be distinct and in increasing order, so if a=2, then b must be at least 3, c at least 4, d at least 5.So, sum b + c + d =15, with 3 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;d &lt;=9.Let&#39;s find such triples.Start with d=9:Then b + c =15 -9=6. With 3&lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=8.Possible (b,c): (3,3), but duplicates not allowed. (3,4)=7, too big. Wait, 6-3=3, but c must be &gt;b. So no solutions here.d=8:b + c =15 -8=7. 3&lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=7.Possible pairs: (3,4)=7. So (3,4,8)d=7:b + c =15 -7=8. 3&lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=6.Possible pairs: (3,5)=8, (4,4)=8 invalid. So (3,5,7)d=6:b + c =15 -6=9. 3&lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=5.Possible pairs: (3,6) but c &lt;=5. Not possible. Similarly, (4,5)=9, so (4,5,6)d=5: sum=15-5=10. b +c=10, but b &gt;=3, c &gt;=4, but d=5 requires c &lt;=4. Contradiction. Impossible.Therefore, triples for a=2 are: (3,4,8), (3,5,7), (4,5,6). That is 3 subsets.So T1 when a=2 is 3.a=3:Then b + c + d =17 -3=14, with b &gt;=4, c &gt;=5, d &gt;=6.Wait, actually, since a=3, the remaining digits must be greater than 3. So b &gt;=4, c &gt;=5, d &gt;=6.So sum b + c + d =14, with 4 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;d &lt;=9.Start with d=9:b + c =14 -9=5. With 4 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=8. The only possible pair is (4,1), but c &gt;b &gt;=4, so minimum b=4, c=5. But 4+5=9 &gt;5. Not possible.d=8:b + c =14 -8=6. With 4 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=7.Possible pairs: (4,2) invalid. 4 + 2=6, but c must be &gt;b &gt;=4. So minimum b=4, c=5: 4+5=9&gt;6. No solutions.d=7:b + c =14 -7=7. With 4 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=6.Possible pairs: (4,3) invalid. 4+5=9&gt;7. No solutions.d=6:b + c =14 -6=8. With 4 &lt;=b &lt;c &lt;=5.But c &lt;=5, so 4 +5=9&gt;8. No solutions.Lower d: impossible.So no subsets for a=3.a=4:Then b + c + d =17 -4=13, with b &gt;=5, c &gt;=6, d &gt;=7.But 5 +6 +7=18 &gt;13. Impossible.Similarly, higher a will only make the required sum smaller, which is impossible since the minimal sum increases.Therefore, T1 = subsets with a=1:6 + a=2:3 + a=3:0 + ... =9.Now compute T2: subsets of {1,...,9} with 5 elements summing to 17.Again, we need to find 5 distinct digits from 1-9 adding to 17.Let me attempt similar approach.List all 5-element subsets {a,b,c,d,e}, 1&lt;=a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt; e &lt;=9, sum=17.The minimal sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15, next is 1+2+3+4+6=16, then 1+2+3+4+7=17. So starting here.Let’s list them:Start with a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7: sum=1+2+3+4+7=17a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6: sum=1+2+3+5+6=17Next, check if there are others.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6What about a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: duplicates, invalid.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6Check a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=5: same as previous.Wait, maybe another combination.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6What about a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: no.a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: no.Wait, perhaps a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: no, duplicate.Wait, maybe a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=5: same as before.Alternatively, a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: duplicates.Wait, maybe higher a.a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.Alternatively, a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: same.Wait, let&#39;s check if there are others.Is there a subset like a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7Another one: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6Another possibility: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=5: same as a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6 when sorted.Wait, perhaps a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: nope.Wait, let&#39;s try a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.How about a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: invalid.Alternatively, a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: nope.Wait, maybe a=1, b=2, c=3, d=7, e=4: which is same as the first one.Alternatively, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7 and a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6. Are these the only two?Wait, let&#39;s check sum=17 with five digits starting with 1.Next possible:a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7=17a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6=17Is there another combination where a=1, but different digits?For example, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=5: same as above.a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: duplicate.Alternatively, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7=17Wait, another possibility: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.What about a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6=17Is there a subset with a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: no.What if a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: duplicate.Alternatively, a=1, b=2, c=5, d=6, e=3: same as previous.Wait, maybe no other combinations.Check another starting point.a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6Wait, let&#39;s check a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalid.Wait, how about a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: invalid.Alternatively, a=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: nope.Wait, perhaps a=1, b=2, c=4, d=6, e=4: invalid.Hmmm, maybe these are the only two.But let&#39;s think again. If the minimal sum is 15, then 17 is just two more. So possible subsets would be the minimal subset (1,2,3,4,5) with sum 15, then add 2 to two of the digits. But need to maintain uniqueness.Wait, perhaps:Start with 1,2,3,4,5 (sum 15). To get sum 17, we need to increase two digits by 1 each, but ensuring they remain distinct.For example, change 5 to 6 and 4 to 5: but that would be 1,2,3,5,6 (sum 17). Which is one of the subsets we found.Alternatively, change 5 to 7 and 3 to 4: 1,2,4,4,7: duplicates. Not allowed.Alternatively, change 5 to 6 and 3 to 4: 1,2,4,5,6 (sum 18). Too much.Alternatively, increase two different digits: perhaps 1 to 2 and 5 to 6: duplicates.Wait, this approach may not be helpful.Alternatively, perhaps there are more subsets.Wait, let&#39;s check a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: duplicate.Wait, a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=7: sum=17a=1, b=2, c=3, d=5, e=6: sum=17a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, e=5: invalida=1, b=3, c=4, d=5, e=4: invalidWait, maybe another one: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6, e=5: same as a=1,2,3,5,6.Any others?Let me think. What about subsets that include 1,2,4,5,5: nope. Or 1,3,4,5,4: nope.Alternatively, subsets starting with 1,2,3,7,4: same as 1,2,3,4,7.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s another way. Let&#39;s list all possible combinations.Possible 5-digit numbers from 1-9 without repetition summing to17.Start with 1,2,3,4,7=171,2,3,5,6=171,2,4,5,5=invalid1,2,3,6,5= same as 1,2,3,5,61,3,4,5,4=invalidWait, how about 1,2,4,5,5: invalid.How about 1,2,4,6,4: invalid.Alternatively, 1,2,5,6,3: same as 1,2,3,5,6.What if a=1, b=2, c=7, d= something: 1+2+7=10, then remaining two digits need to sum to7. But the remaining digits must be greater than 7, which is impossible.Similarly, a=1, b=3: 1+3=4, then c + d + e=13. But c &gt;=4, d &gt;=5, e &gt;=6. Minimum sum=4+5+6=15 &gt;13. Impossible.a=1, b=4: 1+4=5, c + d + e=12. c &gt;=5, minimum sum=5+6+7=18 &gt;12. Impossible.Similarly, higher a&#39;s are worse.Therefore, only two subsets in T2: {1,2,3,4,7} and {1,2,3,5,6}. Therefore, T2=2.Wait, but wait, earlier when a=1, we found two subsets. But when a=2 or higher, maybe there are more?Wait, no. Wait, T2 is 5-element subsets from {1,...,9} summing to17. We considered starting with a=1, found two. What about subsets not starting with 1?For example, a=2.Let’s see:a=2, then we need b + c + d + e =17 -2=15, with b &gt;=3, c &gt;=4, d &gt;=5, e &gt;=6.Wait, but 3+4+5+6=18 &gt;15. So impossible.Therefore, T2=2.Therefore, total T = T1 + T2 =9 + 2=11.Wait, but earlier for T1 (subsets including 0, i.e., 5-element subsets including 0 and four digits summing to17), we found T1=9. For T2 (subsets excluding 0, 5-element subsets from 1-9 summing to17), we found T2=2. So total T=11.But let me double-check that. Wait, in Case1, when we computed subsets including 0 (T1), we found 9 subsets. In Case2, subsets not including0 (T2), we found 2 subsets. So total T=11. Therefore, the total number of subsets for both sum 17 and 28 is 2*T=22? Wait, no. Wait, T is the number of subsets with sum17 (including and excluding0). Then the number of subsets with sum28 is equal to T, since each subset with sum17 corresponds to a subset with sum28. Therefore, total number of valid subsets (sum17 or28) is T + T=2*T=22.But according to our calculation, T=11, so total subsets=22.But wait, let&#39;s verify. If T=11, which is the number of subsets with sum17 (including0 and excluding0), then the number with sum28 is also11, so total subsets is22.But when we computed T1=9 and T2=2, summing to T=11. So each of these subsets corresponds to a complement subset with sum28. For example, each subset with sum17 that includes0 corresponds to a subset with sum28 that excludes0, and vice versa. So total valid subsets for even positions are11 (sum17) +11 (sum28)=22.But in our earlier calculation, we had T=11 for sum17. So the total number of valid splits is22.But in the problem statement, we need to count all ten-digit numbers using all digits0-9 exactly once, first digit non-zero, and divisible by99. Which corresponds to these22 subsets, each contributing a certain number of permutations.But according to our previous analysis, the total number of valid numbers is120*216*T, where T=11. Wait, no. Wait, the formula was total numbers=120*216*(N1 + N2). But N1 + N2 = T=11. Wait, no. Wait, going back:We had T = N1 + N2, where N1 is the number of subsets with sum17 including0, and N2 is the number of subsets with sum17 excluding0. Then, for the total valid numbers, it&#39;s 120*216*T. Wait, but in our case, T=11. Therefore, total numbers=120*216*11.But 120*216=25920. Then 25920*11=285,120.But this seems high. Let me check again.Wait, the formula we derived was total numbers=5! * [N1 * 5! + N2 * (5! -4!)] +5! * [N2 * 5! + N1 * (5! -4!)] which simplified to 120*216*(N1 + N2). But in our case, N1 + N2 = T1 + T2=9 +2=11. So total numbers=120*216*11=120*2376= Let&#39;s compute 120*2376:First, 100*2376=237,60020*2376=47,520Total=237,600 +47,520=285,120.But I need to confirm if this is correct.But according to our earlier steps:For each subset S (sum17 or28):If S includes0, then even positions can be permutated in5! ways, odd positions (which don&#39;t have0) can be permutated in5! ways.If S excludes0, then even positions permutated in5! ways, odd positions (which include0) can be permutated in5! -4! ways.But the number of subsets S with sum17 including0 isN1=9, and with sum17 excluding0 isN2=2. Similarly, for sum28, it&#39;s the complements: subsets with sum28 including0 isN2=2, and excluding0 isN1=9.Therefore, the total number of valid numbers is:For sum17 subsets:- 9 subsets including0: each contributes5! *5! =120*120=14,400. Total=9*14,400=129,600- 2 subsets excluding0: each contributes5!*(5! -4!)=120*(120 -24)=120*96=11,520. Total=2*11,520=23,040For sum28 subsets:- 2 subsets including0: each contributes14,400. Total=2*14,400=28,800-9 subsets excluding0: each contributes11,520. Total=9*11,520=103,680Total numbers=129,600 +23,040 +28,800 +103,680= Let&#39;s compute:129,600 +23,040=152,64028,800 +103,680=132,480Total=152,640 +132,480=285,120.Yes, so total numbers=285,120.But wait, is this the correct answer? Let&#39;s check with known results.But wait, I recall that the number of ten-digit pandigital numbers divisible by99 is known to be9×9×8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1=9×9! But that doesn&#39;t make sense.Wait, no. Wait, actually, there&#39;s a standard result here. The number is 9!×4!×2, but I need to verify.Alternatively, perhaps the total number is 4×9!.But according to our calculation, it&#39;s285,120=9!× something. 9!=362,880, which is larger than285,120. 285,120 divided by9! is285,120 /362,880=0.785≈. Not helpful.Alternatively, 285,120 divided by10! (3,628,800) is≈0.0785.But this doesn&#39;t help. Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, the total number of ten-digit pandigital numbers (with first digit non-zero) is9×9!=9×362,880=3,265,920.Our answer is285,120. So approximately 8.7% of all pandigital numbers are divisible by99. That seems plausible.But let me check for possible errors in reasoning.First, we calculated that the number of subsets with sum17 is11, leading to22 subsets (sum17 and28). Each subset contributes a certain number of permutations. For subsets including0, even permutations are5! and odd permutations (no0) are5!; for subsets excluding0, odd permutations have0 and subtract the cases where0 is first.But is there a mistake in assuming that all subsets are unique and complement each other correctly?Wait, but according to our calculation, there are11 subsets with sum17 (including0 and excluding0). Their complements would be11 subsets with sum28. So total22 subsets. Each of these subsets, when used for even positions, gives a valid split. Then, for each of these22 subsets, we calculate the number of valid permutations. As per our earlier calculation, each subset contributes either14,400 or11,520 numbers, depending on whether it includes0 or not.But adding them up gives285,120.Alternatively, if we think that for each of the22 subsets (11 sum17 and11 sum28), each contributes5!*5! =120*120=14,400 permutations, but then subtract the cases where0 is in the first position for the subsets where0 is in the odd positions.But in the sum17 case, subsets including0 have even positions with0, so odd positions don&#39;t have0, hence all permutations are allowed. For sum17 subsets excluding0, the odd positions include0, so need to subtract those permutations where0 is first. Similarly, for sum28 subsets, which are complements of sum17 subsets: sum28 subsets including0 correspond to sum17 subsets excluding0, hence the odd positions include0, so subtract permutations with0 first. sum28 subsets excluding0 correspond to sum17 subsets including0, so odd positions don&#39;t include0, hence all permutations allowed.Therefore, the total number is:For sum17:- 9 subsets including0:9*5!*5! =9*14,400=129,600-2 subsets excluding0:2*(5!*(5! -4!))=2*11,520=23,040For sum28:-2 subsets including0:2*5!*5!=2*14,400=28,800-9 subsets excluding0:9*(5!*(5! -4!))=9*11,520=103,680Total:129,600 +23,040 +28,800 +103,680=285,120.This seems correct.But I want to confirm the count of subsets. We found that T=11 (9 subsets including0 and2 subsets excluding0 for sum17). Therefore, the total number of such subsets is22. But let&#39;s verify that with an example.Take subset including0: {0,1,2,3,11} Wait, no. Wait, the subsets with sum17 include0 and four other digits. For example, {0,2,5,9, something}? Wait, no.Wait, actually, in our calculation, for sum17 subsets including0, we had T1=9. These are the subsets where0 is included and the other four digits sum to17. We found that there are9 such subsets. Similarly, subsets excluding0 sum to17, we found2.But to verify, let&#39;s take an example subset including0.For example, one of the subsets is0,2,5,9, and the other two digits? Wait, no. Wait, sum17 with0: sum of four digits is17. For example, in our earlier calculation, we had for a=1: six subsets. For a=2: three subsets. So for T1=9, these are:Case1 (a=1): six subsets:{0,1,2,5,9}, {0,1,3,4,9}, {0,1,2,6,8}, {0,1,3,5,8}, {0,1,3,6,7}, {0,1,4,5,7}Wait, actually, no. Wait, in our earlier analysis, for sum17 including0, we considered subsets where0 is included, and the other four digits sum to17. We split into cases where the minimal digit (a) in the four digits is1,2,3, etc.Wait, in the sum=17 case including0, the four digits are from1-9, summing to17. So for a=1, we had six subsets:(1,2,5,9), (1,3,4,9), (1,2,6,8), (1,3,5,8), (1,3,6,7), (1,4,5,7)Therefore, including0, the subsets would be:{0,1,2,5,9}, {0,1,3,4,9}, {0,1,2,6,8}, {0,1,3,5,8}, {0,1,3,6,7}, {0,1,4,5,7}That&#39;s six subsets.For a=2, three subsets:(2,3,4,8), (2,3,5,7), (2,4,5,6)Including0:{0,2,3,4,8}, {0,2,3,5,7}, {0,2,4,5,6}That&#39;s three subsets.Total T1=6+3=9.Similarly, the subsets for sum17 excluding0 are two:{1,2,3,4,7} and {1,2,3,5,6}Therefore, T=9+2=11.Thus, the calculation seems accurate.Therefore, the total number of valid ten-digit numbers is285,120.But I should check if there is any overcounting or undercounting.Wait, for each subset S (even positions), we compute permutations of even and odd positions. Each subset is unique, so no overlap. Therefore, the total count should be correct.Therefore, the answer should be285,120.But I recall that there is a known result for this problem. Let me recall. I think the number is 4×9! = 145,1520 ÷10=145,152? Wait, no.Wait, 4×9! =4×362,880=1,451,520. But that&#39;s larger than our result.Wait, alternatively, the number is9!×4! =362,880×24=8,709,120, which is too big.Alternatively, the number is9! /2=181,440, but our result is285,120, which is larger.Hmm, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is indeed285,120.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation in the number of subsets.Let me verify T=11.For sum17 subsets including0 (T1=9):As listed:{0,1,2,5,9}, {0,1,3,4,9}, {0,1,2,6,8}, {0,1,3,5,8}, {0,1,3,6,7}, {0,1,4,5,7}, {0,2,3,4,8}, {0,2,3,5,7}, {0,2,4,5,6}That&#39;s9 subsets.For sum17 subsets excluding0 (T2=2):{1,2,3,4,7}, {1,2,3,5,6}Yes, two subsets.Total T=11. So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, total valid numbers=285,120.But let me check a smaller case for sanity.Suppose we have digits0-3, making a4-digit number, first digit non-zero, divisible by99. But99 is9*11. The sum of digits0+1+2+3=6, which is not divisible by9, so no such numbers. Makes sense.Another example: digits0-5, 6-digit numbers. Sum=15, divisible by3 but not9. So no numbers divisible by99.Alternatively, digits0-8, nine-digit numbers. Sum=36, divisible by9. Need to check divisibility by11. The difference S_odd - S_even must be divisible by11. Total sum36. So S_odd - S_even =11k. Also, S_odd + S_even=36. So S_odd=(36 +11k)/2 must be integer. So36 +11k must be even. Since36 is even,11k must be even, so k must be even. Possible k= -2,0,2.Compute possible D=11k: -22,0,22.Check possible:D=0: S_odd=18, S_even=18. Possible?Split nine digits into5 odd positions and4 even positions. Sum18 each. The number of ways would depend on possible splits.But calculating it would take time. But the point is, the method seems valid.Therefore, returning to the original problem, I think our answer of285,120 is correct.But to cross-validate, let&#39;s consider that each valid number corresponds to a permutation where the even-position digits sum to17 or28, and the first digit is non-zero.The total number of such permutations is285,120, which is the answer.Final Answerboxed{285120}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the number of ten-digit numbers using all digits from 0 to 9 exactly once (without repetition) that are divisible by 99, we need to check the divisibility rules for 9 and 11. 1. Divisibility by 9: The sum of all digits from 0 to 9 is 45, which is divisible by 9. Hence, all pandigital numbers are divisible by 9.2. Divisibility by 11: The difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions must be a multiple of 11. Given the total sum of digits is 45, we need ( S_{text{odd}} - S_{text{even}} ) to be a multiple of 11. This translates to ( 45 - 2S_{text{even}} ) being a multiple of 11. The possible values for ( S_{text{even}} ) are 17 or 28 (since these are the only values that make ( 45 - 2S_{text{even}} ) a multiple of 11).Key Steps:1. Count subsets of digits summing to 17 or 28:   - For sum 17, we found 11 subsets (9 including 0 and 2 excluding 0).   - For sum 28, each subset is the complement of a sum 17 subset, so there are also 11 subsets.2. Calculate valid permutations:   - For each valid subset, the number of permutations is calculated considering the first digit cannot be zero.   - Subsets including 0 allow all permutations of odd positions.   - Subsets excluding 0 require subtracting permutations where the first digit is zero.Calculations:- For subsets including 0: ( 5! times 5! )- For subsets excluding 0: ( 5! times (5! - 4!) )Summing these contributions for all subsets gives the total number of valid permutations:- For sum 17 subsets: ( 9 times 120 times 120 + 2 times 120 times 96 )- For sum 28 subsets: ( 2 times 120 times 120 + 9 times 120 times 96 )Total permutations:[129600 + 23040 + 28800 + 103680 = 285120]Thus, the number of ten-digit numbers divisible by 99 is (boxed{285120}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>7.285 120 .Since the sum of the ten digits from 0 to 9 is 45, and 9 mid 45, such a ten-digit number is always divisible by 9.Now, divide the ten digits from 0 to 9 into two groups, each containing 5 digits, with their sums being x and y respectively, where x geqslant y geqslant 10.If 11 mid (x-y), then the ten-digit number is divisible by 11, with x+y=45, and x-y=11kleft(k in mathbf{Z}_{+}right).Solving this, we get x=28, y=17.Notice that, among the ten digits, there are 11 groups of five digits whose sum is 17:begin{array}{l}{0,1,2,5,9},{0,1,2,6,8}, {0,1,3,4,9},{0,1,3,5,8}, {0,1,3,6,7},{0,1,4,5,7}, {0,2,3,4,8},{0,2,3,5,7}, {0,2,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,7}, {1,2,3,5,6} .end{array}Therefore, the number of such ten-digit numbers is11 times(5!times 5!+4 times 4!times 5!)=285120 .</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>12.10.

We need to find all natural numbers n &gt; 2 such that we can select n points on a plane where any two points are vertices of an equilateral triangle with the third vertex also among the selected points. Hmm, that&#39;s interesting. Let me break it down.First, let&#39;s understand the requirement. For any two points in the set, there must exist a third point in the set that forms an equilateral triangle with them. So, given any pair, the third vertex needed to complete the equilateral triangle is already present. That seems like a very symmetric arrangement. The points must be arranged in such a way that every pair has their corresponding third vertex included.Let me start with small values of n. Let&#39;s see:n = 3: The simplest case. If we have three points forming an equilateral triangle, then any two points do form a triangle with the third. So that works. But the problem asks for n greater than 2, so 3 is possible. But wait, the problem says &quot;values of n ∈ N, greater than 2&quot;, so 3 is allowed. But maybe they are looking for n beyond that. Let&#39;s check n=4.n = 4: Can we have four points where every pair is part of an equilateral triangle with another point? Let&#39;s think. Let&#39;s start with three points forming an equilateral triangle. If we add a fourth point, where should it be? For the fourth point to satisfy the condition, every pair involving the fourth point must form a triangle with another existing point.Suppose we have triangle ABC. Let&#39;s add point D. Now, the pairs AD, BD, CD each need to form equilateral triangles with some other points. If D is the center of the triangle ABC, but the center (centroid) doesn&#39;t form equilateral triangles with any two vertices. So that&#39;s not going to work. Alternatively, maybe D is another point such that ABD is equilateral. But if ABC is already equilateral, where can D be?If we consider the three-dimensional case, we can have a tetrahedron, but the problem is on a plane. So in 2D, perhaps we need to construct another equilateral triangle adjacent to ABC. For example, if we take point D such that ABD is an equilateral triangle. But then, where is D? If ABC is equilateral, then D would be a reflection of C over AB or something. Let me visualize.Suppose ABC is equilateral with side length 1. Let me try to place D such that ABD is also equilateral. The point D would be the reflection of C across the line AB. So, if ABC is oriented with AB horizontal, then C is above AB, and D would be the mirror image below AB. Then ABD is equilateral. But now, does this work? Let&#39;s check the pairs involving D.Pair AD: For AD to be part of an equilateral triangle, there must be a point E such that ADE is equilateral. The possible points are A, B, C, D. If E is one of them. Let&#39;s see. If E is C, then triangle ADC. Is that equilateral? Let&#39;s see. AC is length 1, AD is length 1 (since ABD is equilateral), and CD would be the distance between the original C and the reflection D. The distance between C and D would be 2 times the height of the original triangle. The height is √3/2, so CD would be 2*(√3/2) = √3. So triangle ACD would have sides 1, 1, √3, which is not equilateral. So that doesn&#39;t work. Similarly, if E is B, triangle ADB is equilateral, which is true. So for pair AD, the third vertex is B, which is already in the set. Wait, but the problem states that &quot;any two of them are vertices of an equilateral triangle, the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points.&quot; So, for any two points, there exists a third point in the set such that those three form an equilateral triangle. Wait, does it mean that for every pair, there is exactly one such triangle, or at least one? The problem says &quot;the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points.&quot; So, for every pair, there must exist at least one third point that forms an equilateral triangle with them.So in our four-point case: ABC is original equilateral triangle, D is reflection of C over AB. Now, let&#39;s check all pairs.Pairs in ABC: AB, AC, BC. Each of these already form a triangle with the third point, which is in the set. Then the pairs involving D: AD, BD, CD.AD: Can AD form an equilateral triangle with another point? If we have points A, D, then the third point could be B (since ABD is equilateral). So yes, triangle ABD is equilateral. Similarly, BD: BD and A? Yes, ABD. BD and C? Let&#39;s see, BD and C. The distance BD is 1, BC is 1, but DC is √3. So triangle BDC has sides BD=1, BC=1, DC=√3. Not equilateral. So BD and C can&#39;t form an equilateral triangle. Wait, but BD needs to form an equilateral triangle with some third point. The possible third points are A, C, or the other D? Wait, we only have four points: A, B, C, D.Wait, BD: To form an equilateral triangle with BD, the third point must be such that BDX is equilateral. If we consider point A, then ABD is equilateral. So yes, that&#39;s already covered. So BD with A forms ABD. BD with C, as above, is not equilateral. BD with D is not a triangle. So BD is okay because ABD exists.Similarly, CD: What about CD? The pair CD. To form an equilateral triangle, we need a third point. The possible third points are A, B, or D. Let&#39;s check:- C, D, A: triangle CDA. Sides CD=√3, CA=1, DA=1. Not equilateral.- C, D, B: triangle CDB. Similarly, CD=√3, CB=1, DB=1. Not equilateral.- C, D, D: Not a triangle.So the pair CD does not form an equilateral triangle with any third point in the set. Therefore, the four-point configuration doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition because the pair CD doesn&#39;t have a third point to form an equilateral triangle. Therefore, n=4 is not possible.Hmm, so maybe four points don&#39;t work. Let&#39;s try another approach. Maybe instead of adding a single point, we need a different configuration. Wait, but in the plane, the equilateral triangle&#39;s properties might limit how we can place points. Each pair defines two possible equilateral triangles (one on each side of the line). So perhaps to satisfy the condition, for every edge, both possible third vertices must be present? But that would require more points.Wait, but the problem states that for any two points, the third vertex is also among the selected points. So for each pair, there must be at least one third point. It doesn&#39;t have to be both, just at least one. So maybe constructing a configuration where each pair has one third point.Let me think about n=4 again. Suppose we take a regular tetrahedron, but on the plane. Wait, regular tetrahedron is 3D. On the plane, the most symmetric figures are regular polygons. Maybe a regular hexagon? Let&#39;s see.Wait, a regular hexagon has six points. Let me check n=6.Wait, in a regular hexagon, each pair of adjacent points are distance 1 apart (if side length 1), but non-adjacent pairs have larger distances. However, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices is 2, and other distances are √3. So, maybe equilateral triangles can be formed. For example, in a regular hexagon, every other vertex forms an equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s take points A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Then, triangle ACE is equilateral. Similarly, BDF is equilateral. But does every pair of points form an equilateral triangle with another point?Wait, take two adjacent points, A and B. Is there a point X such that ABX is equilateral? In the regular hexagon, the angle between adjacent points is 60 degrees. So from A to B, rotating 60 degrees. If we go from A to B, then the point X could be the next one, but AB and BC form 60 degrees, but ABX would require X to be such that AB and AX form 60 degrees. Wait, in the regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, in a regular hexagon, if you take every other vertex, you get an equilateral triangle. So points A, C, E form an equilateral triangle, as do B, D, F. But if I pick two points that are two apart, like A and C, then E is the third point. But if I pick two adjacent points, A and B, is there a third point that makes an equilateral triangle?The distance between A and B is equal to the side length, say &#39;s&#39;. To form an equilateral triangle, the third point should be at distance &#39;s&#39; from both A and B. In a regular hexagon, the points adjacent to A and B are F and C. The distance from A to F is &#39;s&#39;, and from B to C is &#39;s&#39;, but the distance from F to C is 2s*sin(60°) = √3s, which is longer. So triangle ABF would have sides AB = s, AF = s, and BF = √3s, which is not equilateral. Similarly, triangle ABC would have AB = s, BC = s, and AC = 2s, which is not equilateral. So in a regular hexagon, two adjacent points do not form an equilateral triangle with any other single vertex. Therefore, a regular hexagon doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition because pairs like AB don&#39;t have a third point to form an equilateral triangle. So n=6 might not work either.Hmm. Maybe the only possible n is 3? But the problem says &quot;find all n &gt; 2&quot;, so maybe 3 is the only one. But the problem is from SFRY, 76, which might be an Olympiad problem, so maybe there&#39;s another value. Wait, let&#39;s think again.Wait, perhaps a larger configuration. Suppose we take multiple equilateral triangles arranged in a star or something. For example, the vertices of a regular tetrahedron in 3D projected onto 2D? Wait, but projections might distort distances. Alternatively, consider a lattice of equilateral triangles. But in a lattice, every pair of points would have multiple distances, so unless the lattice is very dense, but even so, not every pair would form an equilateral triangle with another point.Wait, another idea. Let&#39;s consider the complex plane. Represent points as complex numbers. Suppose we have a set of complex numbers such that for any two, say z1 and z2, there exists a z3 such that z1, z2, z3 form an equilateral triangle. In complex numbers, rotating a point by 60 degrees around another point can give the third vertex. So, if the set is closed under such rotations, maybe it would work.For example, start with 0 and 1. To form an equilateral triangle with 0 and 1, we need the third point to be either 0 + e^{iπ/3}(1 - 0) = e^{iπ/3} or the other rotation, which would be e^{-iπ/3}. So, adding those two points. Then, with the new points, we have to check all pairs again. But this process might keep generating new points indefinitely, leading to an infinite set. But we need a finite set. So unless the rotations by 60 degrees close after some steps.Wait, if we consider the 6th roots of unity, they form a regular hexagon, but as we saw earlier, adjacent points don&#39;t form equilateral triangles. But all the roots are spaced 60 degrees apart. Wait, no, 6th roots are spaced 60 degrees, but in a regular hexagon, adjacent points are 60 degrees apart in angle, but the distance between them is the side length. Wait, in complex plane, the 6th roots of unity are at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, ..., 300°, each separated by 60°, and the distance between adjacent roots is 1 (if on the unit circle). But the chord length between two roots separated by k steps is 2*sin(πk/6). So, for k=1, it&#39;s 2*sin(π/6)=1. For k=2, 2*sin(π/3)=√3. For k=3, 2*sin(π/2)=2. So in this case, pairs of points separated by one step (adjacent) have distance 1, two steps have √3, three steps have 2. So, for two points separated by one step, to form an equilateral triangle, the third point should be at 1 distance from both. For example, take 0° and 60°. The third point should be at 1 distance from both. The two possible points are 120° and -60° (i.e., 300°). But in the 6th roots of unity, 120° is present, and 300° is also present. So, for the pair (0°, 60°), the third points are 120° and 300°. But in the 6th roots, both are present. Wait, but if we have all six roots, then for each pair separated by one step, there are two possible third points. However, only one of them is in the set. Wait, let&#39;s check.Take the pair (0°, 60°). The third point to form an equilateral triangle could be 0° rotated 60° around 60°, which is 120°, or 60° rotated -60° around 0°, which is 0°. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. If we have points at 0° (1,0) and 60° (1/2, √3/2), then the third point to form an equilateral triangle can be found by rotating one point around the other by 60°. Rotating 0° around 60° by 60° gives a point. Let me compute that.In complex numbers, rotating a point z around point w by angle θ is given by:z&#39; = (z - w) * e^{iθ} + wSo rotating 0° (which is 1 + 0i) around 60° (which is 1/2 + (√3/2)i) by 60° (π/3 radians):z&#39; = (1 - (1/2 + (√3/2)i)) * (cos(π/3) + i sin(π/3)) + (1/2 + (√3/2)i)Compute the difference: 1 - (1/2 + (√3/2)i) = 1/2 - (√3/2)iMultiply by e^{iπ/3} = 1/2 + (√3/2)i:(1/2 - (√3/2)i)(1/2 + (√3/2)i) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)(√3/2)i - (√3/2)i(1/2) - (√3/2)^2 i^2= 1/4 + (√3/4)i - (√3/4)i - (3/4)(-1)= 1/4 + 3/4 = 1Then add back the center (1/2 + (√3/2)i):1 + (1/2 + (√3/2)i) = 3/2 + (√3/2)iWhich is the point at 60° + 60° = 120°, but with a magnitude. Wait, actually, (3/2, √3/2) is not on the unit circle. Wait, this seems wrong. Maybe my approach is incorrect.Alternatively, if you have two points, A and B, to find the third point C such that ABC is equilateral, you can rotate point B around A by 60°, or rotate point A around B by 60°. Each rotation gives a different point. So in the complex plane, given two complex numbers a and b, the third point can be (b - a) * e^{iπ/3} + a, or (a - b) * e^{iπ/3} + b. So these are two different points unless the rotation results in the same point.So, for the pair (0°, 60°), which are 1 and e^{iπ/3}, the third points would be:C1 = (e^{iπ/3} - 1) * e^{iπ/3} + 1= e^{i2π/3} - e^{iπ/3} + 1Similarly,C2 = (1 - e^{iπ/3}) * e^{iπ/3} + e^{iπ/3}= e^{iπ/3} - e^{i2π/3} + e^{iπ/3}= 2e^{iπ/3} - e^{i2π/3}These might not be in the 6th roots of unity. Let me compute C1:C1 = e^{i2π/3} - e^{iπ/3} + 1Convert to rectangular coordinates:e^{i2π/3} = -1/2 + i√3/2e^{iπ/3} = 1/2 + i√3/21 = 1 + 0iSo,C1 = (-1/2 + i√3/2) - (1/2 + i√3/2) + 1= (-1/2 - 1/2) + (i√3/2 - i√3/2) + 1= -1 + 0i + 1 = 0Wait, that&#39;s the origin? That doesn&#39;t seem right. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.Wait, (e^{iπ/3} - 1) * e^{iπ/3} + 1:First compute e^{iπ/3} - 1:(cos(π/3) + i sin(π/3)) - 1 = (1/2 - 1) + i(√3/2) = (-1/2) + i√3/2Multiply by e^{iπ/3}:Multiply (-1/2 + i√3/2) by (1/2 + i√3/2):Real part: (-1/2)(1/2) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = -1/4 - 3/4 = -1Imaginary part: (-1/2)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(1/2) = (-√3/4 + √3/4) = 0Then add 1: -1 + 1 = 0. So C1 is 0. But 0 is not part of our original points (which were on the unit circle). So that&#39;s not helpful. Hmm.Similarly, C2:(1 - e^{iπ/3}) * e^{iπ/3} + e^{iπ/3}First compute 1 - e^{iπ/3} = 1 - (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2Multiply by e^{iπ/3} = (1/2 + i√3/2):(1/2 - i√3/2)(1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)(i√3/2) - (i√3/2)(1/2) - (i√3/2)^2= 1/4 + i√3/4 - i√3/4 - ( -3/4 )= 1/4 + 3/4 = 1Then add e^{iπ/3}: 1 + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 3/2 + i√3/2Which is the point (3/2, √3/2), which is outside the unit circle. So again, not part of the original 6th roots.So in the case of the regular hexagon (unit circle), the third points required to form equilateral triangles with adjacent pairs are not in the set. Therefore, regular hexagon doesn&#39;t work. So maybe n=6 is out.Wait, so perhaps n=3 is the only possible? But the problem says &quot;find all n &gt; 2&quot;. Maybe the answer is all multiples of 3? Wait, 3, 6, 9,... but our trials with n=4, 6 didn&#39;t work. Alternatively, maybe only n=3 is possible. But let me think again.Wait, another idea: if we take three equilateral triangles arranged to form a larger equilateral triangle. For example, a tetrahedron-like configuration but in 2D. Wait, but in 2D, a tetrahedron isn&#39;t possible. Alternatively, the vertices and centers of equilateral triangles?Wait, consider the following configuration: Start with an equilateral triangle. Then, add the centroid. But the centroid doesn&#39;t form equilateral triangles with the vertices. So that&#39;s no good.Alternatively, the vertices of a regular tetrahedron projected onto a plane. But projections distort distances, so probably not.Wait, maybe if we take a triangular lattice. In a triangular lattice, each point has six neighbors arranged in a hexagon, and equilateral triangles are everywhere. But the problem requires a finite set. In an infinite lattice, every pair of points would have the third vertex somewhere in the lattice, but we need a finite n. So that&#39;s not helpful here.Wait, perhaps a solution exists for n=7? Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me think differently.Suppose such a set S exists with n points. Then, for any two points in S, there is a third point in S such that they form an equilateral triangle. Let me consider the implications.First, for each pair of points, there is a unique third point? Or could there be multiple? The problem states &quot;the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points&quot;. So it just requires existence, not uniqueness. So a pair could be part of multiple equilateral triangles, but at least one must have the third vertex in the set.But for the set to be closed under this operation, it&#39;s almost like a group, but not quite. Wait, in group theory terms, if we have an operation that takes two elements and produces a third, but here it&#39;s a geometric condition. Hmm.Alternatively, think of the set as a graph where each edge is part of at least one triangle. But not just any triangle, an equilateral one. So the graph must be such that every edge is in at least one equilateral triangle (in the geometric sense).But how to construct such a graph?Wait, if we have n=3, the complete graph K3 works, as it&#39;s a single triangle. For n=4, as we saw earlier, it&#39;s not possible. For n=7, maybe some special configuration. Alternatively, perhaps only powers of 3? Not sure.Wait, another approach. Let&#39;s consider that each point must be part of multiple equilateral triangles. For example, in a configuration where every point is part of several triangles. However, in order to have every pair of points being part of a triangle, the number of triangles required is C(n, 2), each requiring a third point. But some third points can be shared among multiple pairs.But the problem is in the plane, so there&#39;s a limit to how many equilateral triangles can share a common vertex.Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that they form a union of equilateral triangles, each sharing edges with others. For example, a hexagon with triangles inside. Wait, but earlier attempts showed that regular hexagons don&#39;t work.Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is related to finite projective planes or other combinatorial structures, but with a geometric constraint. Not sure.Wait, going back to the original problem. Let&#39;s suppose that such a configuration exists for some n &gt; 3. What properties must it have?First, each pair of points must have a third point such that the three form an equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s consider the number of times a point is the third vertex. Each point can be the third vertex for multiple pairs. Let’s denote that for a point P, the number of pairs (A, B) such that P is the third vertex of the equilateral triangle ABP. For n points, each pair (A, B) must have at least one such P. The total number of pairs is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. Each point P can be the third vertex for at most some number of pairs. If each equilateral triangle has three pairs, but we are counting each triangle once for each pair. Wait, maybe not.Wait, each equilateral triangle contributes three pairs (AB, AC, BC) each having the third vertex (C, B, A respectively). So each triangle is counted three times in the total count of pairs needing a third vertex. Therefore, if there are T triangles, then the total coverage is 3T. Since we need to cover all C(n, 2) pairs, we have 3T ≥ C(n, 2). But some pairs might be covered by multiple triangles. However, the problem only requires that each pair has at least one third vertex, so 3T ≥ C(n, 2). Therefore, T ≥ C(n, 2)/3.But each triangle uses three pairs. So the minimal number of triangles needed is at least C(n, 2)/3. But each triangle is defined by three points, so the number of triangles is also C(n, 3). Wait, but that&#39;s if every triplet is a triangle, which is not the case here. So perhaps the relationship isn&#39;t straightforward.Alternatively, consider that each point participates in k triangles. Then, the number of triangles is (n * k)/3. Each triangle has three points. The number of pairs covered per triangle is three. So the total pairs covered is (n * k)/3 * 3 = n * k. But the total number of pairs that need to be covered is C(n, 2). Therefore, n * k ≥ C(n, 2) =&gt; k ≥ (n - 1)/2. So each point must be part of at least (n - 1)/2 triangles. Since k must be an integer, this gives a lower bound on the number of triangles each point is involved in.But in the plane, the number of equilateral triangles that a single point can be part of is limited by the geometry. For a given point, how many other points can be at the same distance from it, each forming 60-degree angles? In other words, to form multiple equilateral triangles with a central point, the other points must be placed at 60-degree rotations around it.But in the plane, you can have up to six points at 60-degree intervals around a central point, all at the same distance. However, if those points also need to form equilateral triangles among themselves, that&#39;s the regular hexagon case, which we saw doesn&#39;t work because adjacent points don&#39;t form equilateral triangles with others.Alternatively, if you have three points around a central point at 120-degree intervals, each at the same distance. Then, the central point forms an equilateral triangle with each pair of adjacent outer points. Wait, let&#39;s see. Suppose we have a central point O and three outer points A, B, C, each 120 degrees apart around O, each at distance r from O. Then, the distance between any two outer points is 2r sin(60°) = √3 r. For OA, OB, OC to form equilateral triangles with another point, say OAB: is OA, OB, and AB an equilateral triangle? OA and OB are length r, AB is length √3 r. So not equilateral. Alternatively, maybe O is not part of the triangles. Wait, but the problem requires that any two points form a triangle with a third. So if we have points O, A, B, C, then the pair O and A must form a triangle with some third point. If that third point is B, then OAB would need to be equilateral, but OA and OB are r, AB is √3 r. Not equilateral. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, maybe the outer points form their own equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s say we have four points: three forming an equilateral triangle, and the centroid. But as before, the centroid doesn&#39;t help.Wait, this seems difficult. Maybe the only solution is n=3. Let&#39;s verify n=3. Three points forming an equilateral triangle. Any two points form a triangle with the third. Perfect. So n=3 works. For n=4, as we saw earlier, the configuration fails because some pairs don&#39;t have a third point. For n=7 or other numbers, maybe there&#39;s a special configuration?Wait, here&#39;s another thought. In 3D space, you can have configurations like the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, where each edge is part of three equilateral triangles (each face). But we&#39;re restricted to the plane. However, in the plane, the regular tetrahedron can&#39;t exist. But maybe if you project it onto the plane, although distances would be distorted. Probably not helpful.Wait, maybe using complex numbers again. Suppose we take the cube roots of unity. That gives three points forming an equilateral triangle on the complex plane. If we take the sixth roots, as we tried before, but that didn&#39;t work. Alternatively, maybe a combination of rotated equilateral triangles.Alternatively, consider the following construction: Start with an equilateral triangle ABC. Then, for each pair of points, we need to have the third point. But since we already have all three, adding another point would require that the new point forms equilateral triangles with existing pairs. But as before, this leads to the need for more points, potentially infinitely.Wait, unless the configuration is self-similar. For example, a fractal-like structure where each equilateral triangle has smaller triangles attached. But again, that would be infinite.Alternatively, maybe n=7 works with a specific configuration. But I can&#39;t think of such a configuration. Maybe the problem is only possible for n=3.Wait, let me look for any mathematical literature or known results. Wait, this seems similar to the concept of &quot;equilateral sets&quot; in metric spaces. In Euclidean space, an equilateral set is a set of points with all pairwise distances equal. But here, the requirement is different: not that all pairs are equal, but that every pair is part of an equilateral triangle. However, I don&#39;t recall a specific term for this.Alternatively, this is similar to a Steiner triple system, where every pair is part of a triple, but here the triples have a geometric condition.In Steiner triple systems, the number of triples is C(n, 2)/3, which requires that n ≡ 1 or 3 mod 6. But our problem is geometric, so the combinatorial conditions may not align. However, if such a system can be embedded in the plane with the geometric condition, maybe n must satisfy those congruence conditions. But since we already have n=3 works, which is 3 mod 6, perhaps n=7 might work? But again, without a geometric construction, it&#39;s speculative.Alternatively, maybe the answer is that no such n &gt; 3 exists, so only n=3. Given that in all attempts to construct n=4 or higher, we run into pairs that don&#39;t have a third point, it&#39;s plausible. Let me try another approach for n=4.Suppose we have four points where every pair is part of an equilateral triangle. Let’s assume the four points form a complete graph where each edge is in at least one equilateral triangle. How many triangles would that require?For four points, there are C(4, 2) = 6 pairs. Each triangle covers three pairs. So if each triangle is distinct, we need at least 6/3 = 2 triangles. But two triangles would share a common edge. Let&#39;s say we have two equilateral triangles sharing a common edge. So, imagine two triangles ABC and ABD, where AB is the common edge. Then, ABC is equilateral and ABD is equilateral. But in this case, points C and D would need to be on different sides of AB. The distance AC = BC = AB, and AD = BD = AB. So, points C and D are both at distance AB from A and B, but on opposite sides. So this forms a rhombus with two equilateral triangles. But in this case, let&#39;s check all pairs:Pairs: AB, AC, BC, AD, BD, CD.- AB: part of both ABC and ABD.- AC: part of ABC. Needs a third point. If we consider AC, the third point is B.- BC: part of ABC. Third point is A.- AD: part of ABD. Third point is B.- BD: part of ABD. Third point is A.- CD: What&#39;s the third point for CD? There is no triangle with CD and another point. The distances are AC = AD = AB, BC = BD = AB, but CD is the distance between C and D. Since C and D are reflections over AB, the distance CD is twice the height of the equilateral triangle ABC. The height is (√3/2)AB, so CD = √3 AB. But there is no point in the set at distance CD from both C and D. The existing points are A, B, C, D. Check:- C and D with A: distance CA = AB, DA = AB, but CD = √3 AB. So triangle ACD has sides AB, AB, √3 AB. Not equilateral.- C and D with B: Similarly, triangle BCD has sides BC=AB, BD=AB, CD=√3 AB. Not equilateral.- C and D with themselves: Not a triangle.Therefore, pair CD doesn&#39;t form an equilateral triangle with any other point. So this configuration fails. Hence, n=4 is impossible.What if we try three equilateral triangles? Let&#39;s say we have points A, B, C forming a triangle, and points A, B, D forming another, and points A, C, E forming another. But now we have points A, B, C, D, E. Each time we add a point, we have to check all pairs. This could lead to an infinite set again.Alternatively, maybe arranging four points in a tetrahedral configuration but in 3D. Wait, but the problem specifies a plane. So 3D configurations are invalid.Another thought: maybe the problem is a trick question where n=3 is the only solution. Given that for any higher n, we cannot satisfy the condition due to geometric constraints. The problem states &quot;n ∈ N, greater than 2&quot;, so 3 and above. If only n=3 works, that&#39;s the answer.But let me check if maybe n=7 works with a more complex configuration. Wait, in finite projective planes, each pair of points lies on a unique line, but here it&#39;s a triangle. Not directly related.Alternatively, consider the Moser spindle, a configuration in graph theory with seven edges. But again, not sure.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach. Assume such a set S exists with n ≥ 4. Then, take any three points A, B, C forming an equilateral triangle. Now, take another point D. For D to form equilateral triangles with A, B, and C, it must be positioned such that for each pair involving D, there&#39;s a third point. Let&#39;s see.For pair AD, there must be a point E such that ADE is equilateral. Similarly, for BD, there&#39;s a point F, and for CD, a point G. If E, F, G are already in S, then the set must include those points. But then those new points need to form triangles with existing points, leading to an infinite regression. Hence, unless the configuration is closed under such operations, which in the plane would require an infinite set, we can&#39;t have finite n &gt; 3.Therefore, the only possible finite n is 3.Hence, the answer is boxed{3}Final AnswerThe only natural number greater than 2 is boxed{3}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding all values of ( n in mathbf{N} ), greater than 2, for which it is possible to select ( n ) points on a plane such that any two of them are vertices of an equilateral triangle with the third vertex also among the selected points, we analyze the following:1. Case ( n = 3 ):   - Three points forming an equilateral triangle satisfy the condition. Each pair of points forms an equilateral triangle with the third point. This works.2. Case ( n = 4 ):   - Consider adding a fourth point to an equilateral triangle. The fourth point must form equilateral triangles with each pair of the original three points. However, the reflection of one vertex over the line joining the other two vertices does not maintain equilateral triangles with all pairs. This configuration fails because pairs involving the new point do not form equilateral triangles with existing points.3. Larger Configurations:   - For ( n = 6 ), considering a regular hexagon, adjacent points do not form equilateral triangles with other vertices. The required third vertex for some pairs is not present.   - Generalizing to larger ( n ), we consider geometric and combinatorial constraints. Each pair must form an equilateral triangle with a third point, leading to complex configurations that either fail geometrically or require an infinite set.4. Conclusion:   - After analyzing various configurations and considering geometric constraints, it is concluded that only ( n = 3 ) works. Larger configurations fail due to the inability to maintain equilateral triangles for all pairs.Thus, the only value of ( n ) greater than 2 that satisfies the condition is (boxed{3}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: Find all natural numbers n greater than 2 for which it&#39;s possible to select n points on a plane such that any two of them are vertices of an equilateral triangle, the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me parse the problem. We need to find all n &gt; 2 where we can arrange n points in a plane with the property that any two points form a side of an equilateral triangle, and the third vertex of that triangle is also among the selected points. So, for any pair of points, there must exist a third point that completes the equilateral triangle. Let me start with small values of n. Let&#39;s see:For n = 3: If we have three points forming an equilateral triangle, then any two points do form a side, and the third vertex is the one completing the triangle. So yes, n=3 works.n=4: Hmm, can we have four points with this property? Let me try to visualize. Suppose we start with an equilateral triangle. Let&#39;s say points A, B, C. Now, we need to add a fourth point D such that any pair among A, B, C, D has a third point forming an equilateral triangle. First, existing pairs (A,B), (A,C), (B,C) already have their third point. Now, pairs involving D: (A,D), (B,D), (C,D). Each of these pairs must form a side of an equilateral triangle with another point from the set. So, for (A,D), there must be a point E such that ADE is equilateral. But E must be one of the existing points: A, B, C, or D. But we already have A, B, C, D. So E has to be one of them. Similarly for (B,D) and (C,D). Let me try to place D. If I take D as the center of the triangle ABC. Wait, but the center (centroid) is not equidistant from all vertices. The distance from centroid to each vertex is less than the side length. So that might not form equilateral triangles. Alternatively, maybe D is another vertex of a larger equilateral triangle? Let&#39;s think.Suppose we have two equilateral triangles sharing a common edge. Wait, but then we would have a rhombus, but not sure if that works. Alternatively, maybe constructing a tetrahedral configuration in 3D, but the problem is on a plane, so it has to be 2D. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe a square? But in a square, the diagonals are longer than the sides, so two points adjacent form a side of the square, but the diagonal is longer. So if we take two adjacent points in a square, the distance is the side length, but the diagonal is √2 times longer, so equilateral triangle would require a third point at the same distance, but that&#39;s not the case in a square. So a square doesn&#39;t work.Wait, maybe a regular hexagon? Let me think. In a regular hexagon, each side is length s, and the distance between every other vertex is 2s, which is longer. But the distance between adjacent vertices is s. If we take two adjacent vertices, the third point forming an equilateral triangle would be... Let&#39;s see. For example, in a regular hexagon, points A, B, C, D, E, F. If I take points A and B, then to form an equilateral triangle, the third point could be F or C? Let me check. The distance from A to B is s. The angle between them is 60 degrees. Wait, in a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if you take points A, B, and then the point that would form an equilateral triangle would be either outside or inside the hexagon. Wait, in a regular hexagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get an equilateral triangle. For example, A, C, E form an equilateral triangle. But in that case, the distance between A and C is 2s, which is longer than the side length. But the problem states that any two points must form a side of an equilateral triangle with a third point in the set. So if two points are adjacent in the hexagon (distance s), is there a third point at distance s forming a triangle? Let&#39;s see. For points A and B, distance s. To form an equilateral triangle, the third point should be at distance s from both A and B. In a regular hexagon, the point F is adjacent to A, and point C is two steps from B. Wait, the point that is 60 degrees from AB would be either inside or outside the hexagon. But in a regular hexagon, such a point might not exist. For example, in the regular hexagon, the angle between A and B is 120 degrees, so the equilateral triangle would require a 60-degree angle. So perhaps the third point is not part of the hexagon. Therefore, a regular hexagon might not work either.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s consider the case where all points lie on a regular triangular lattice. In such a lattice, each point has neighbors in six directions, each 60 degrees apart. So, in that case, any two points that are neighbors can form equilateral triangles in multiple directions. But does this satisfy the condition that any two points are part of an equilateral triangle with a third point? Hmm, not necessarily. Because if two points are not adjacent on the lattice, their distance might not correspond to a lattice distance that allows a third point to form an equilateral triangle.Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that the entire set of points is such that the third vertex for any pair is also in the set. So, the set is closed under the operation of completing an equilateral triangle for any two points. This sounds like a kind of closure property. So, starting with a set S, for any two points in S, the third vertex of the equilateral triangle they form must also be in S. So, S must be closed under this operation.Given that, maybe the minimal such sets are the regular triangles, and then perhaps some other configurations.Wait, for n=3, as we said, it works. What about n=4?Suppose we have four points. Let&#39;s think of a regular tetrahedron, but in 3D. But the problem is on a plane, so 2D. So a regular tetrahedron is out. Alternatively, maybe a square with its center? Wait, but as I thought earlier, a square&#39;s diagonals are longer than the sides. If we take two adjacent vertices, the third point needed would be the center? But the distance from the center to a vertex is (√2/2)*side, which is different from the side length. So that&#39;s not an equilateral triangle.Alternatively, maybe another configuration. Let&#39;s try constructing four points. Suppose we have an equilateral triangle ABC, and then a fourth point D such that D forms equilateral triangles with each pair of the original triangle.So, for example, with triangle ABC, we need D such that ABD, BCD, and ACD are all equilateral triangles. But in 2D, is this possible? If ABC is an equilateral triangle, then the point D would have to be the reflection of C over the line AB, but then D would form another equilateral triangle ABD. Similarly, reflecting A over BC to get D&#39;, and reflecting B over AC to get D&#39;&#39;. But these three reflections give three different points. So in 2D, you can&#39;t have a single point D that serves as the third vertex for all three pairs. Therefore, in 2D, with ABC as an equilateral triangle, adding a fourth point D can only form an equilateral triangle with one pair, not all three. Hence, n=4 might not be possible.Alternatively, maybe a different configuration. Let&#39;s think of a rhombus with 60 and 120-degree angles. Wait, a rhombus with all sides equal, but angles of 60 and 120. In such a rhombus, the diagonals are of different lengths. The shorter diagonal would be equal to the side length, because in a rhombus with 60-degree angles, the diagonals satisfy d_short = side, d_long = side * sqrt(3). Wait, let&#39;s verify.In a rhombus with side length s and angles 60 and 120 degrees, the diagonals can be calculated using the law of cosines. The shorter diagonal splits the rhombus into two equilateral triangles? Wait, no. If the angle is 60 degrees, then the diagonals would be:d1 = 2s sin(30°) = s (since sin(30°)=0.5)d2 = 2s sin(60°) = s√3So the shorter diagonal is length s, equal to the side length. So in such a rhombus, the diagonals are s and s√3. So, if we have a rhombus with vertices A, B, C, D, where AB = BC = CD = DA = s, and angle ABC = 60 degrees, then the diagonals AC = s and BD = s√3. But in this case, the points A, B, C form an equilateral triangle with side length s, and points B, C, D also form an equilateral triangle. However, the diagonal AC is length s, so triangle ACD would have sides AC = s, CD = s, and AD = s. Wait, AD is a side of the rhombus? Wait, no. AD is a side of the rhombus, length s. Wait, in this rhombus, AD is adjacent to angle 120 degrees at D. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should draw it mentally.Let me label the rhombus: A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to A. Angles at B and D are 60 degrees, angles at A and C are 120 degrees. Then, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonal AC splits the rhombus into two triangles, ABC and ADC. Since angle at B is 60 degrees, triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle (AB=BC=AC=s). Similarly, triangle ADC is also equilateral, because DC=AD=AC=s. Wait, but AD is a side of the rhombus, which is length s. So AC is also length s. Therefore, in this case, the rhombus is actually composed of two equilateral triangles joined along a common side AC. Wait, but if ABC is equilateral with side s, then AC is length s. Then ADC is also equilateral with sides AD=DC=AC=s. So this rhombus is actually a regular hexagon? No, a regular hexagon has all sides equal and angles 120 degrees. Wait, but in this case, the rhombus would have four sides, each of length s, and two angles of 60 degrees and two angles of 120 degrees. However, in this configuration, points A, B, C, D have the property that ABC and ADC are equilateral triangles.But in this case, let&#39;s check if any two points form a side of an equilateral triangle with a third point in the set.Take points A and B: they form a side of triangle ABC, whose third vertex is C.Points B and C: form a side of triangle BCD, but wait, in our rhombus, is triangle BCD equilateral? Let&#39;s see. BC = CD = s, but BD is the diagonal, which is s√3. So triangle BCD has sides BC=CD=s and BD=s√3, which is not equilateral. Hence, BCD is not equilateral. Wait, so this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe triangle BCD is not part of the set. Wait, but in this rhombus, if we have points A, B, C, D, then pairs like B and D: the distance BD is s√3, which is not equal to s, so there is no equilateral triangle with side BD in the set. Similarly, pairs like A and D: distance s, and they form a side of triangle ADC, which is equilateral. So pairs A and D: third vertex C. Pairs D and C: third vertex A. Pairs C and B: third vertex A? Wait, no. Wait, in the rhombus, ABC is equilateral, so pairs A and B have C as the third vertex. Pairs B and C: in the rhombus, is there a third vertex? If we consider triangle BCD, which is not equilateral, so no. But wait, the rhombus is two equilateral triangles back-to-back: ABC and ADC. So, if we consider pair B and C: in triangle ABC, the third vertex is A. But the problem states that any two points are the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the third vertex also in the set. So for pair B and C, we have triangle ABC, which is equilateral with third vertex A. Similarly, for pair C and D, we have triangle ADC with third vertex A. Wait, but triangle ADC is also equilateral. So C and D: third vertex A. Similarly, D and A: third vertex C. A and B: third vertex C. Wait, hold on, this seems inconsistent.Wait, in the rhombus ABCD as described (two equilateral triangles ABC and ADC), let&#39;s list all pairs:A-B: part of ABC, third vertex C.A-C: distance AC = s. If we consider equilateral triangle on A-C, third vertex would be B or D? Wait, but B is distance AB = s from A and BC = s from C. Similarly, D is distance AD = s from A and DC = s from C. So either B or D. But triangle ABC and ADC are both equilateral. So pair A-C is part of two equilateral triangles: one with B and one with D. So third vertices are B and D. But the problem states &quot;the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points&quot;. So it&#39;s okay if there are multiple, as long as at least one exists. So for pair A-C, there are two possible third vertices. But the problem only requires that there exists at least one. So that&#39;s okay.But wait, the problem says &quot;any two of them are vertices of an equilateral triangle, the third vertex of which is also one of the selected points&quot;. So for any two points, there must exist at least one third point such that the three form an equilateral triangle. So even if there are multiple, as long as one exists, it&#39;s okay.So let&#39;s check all pairs in the rhombus ABCD:A-B: third vertex C.A-C: third vertex B or D.A-D: third vertex C.B-C: third vertex A.B-D: Hmm, distance BD is s√3. To form an equilateral triangle with B and D, we need a third point at distance s√3 from both B and D. But in our set, the distances are s or s√3. Wait, points in the set are A, B, C, D. The distance between B and D is s√3. So to form an equilateral triangle with side BD, the third vertex must be at distance s√3 from both B and D. But in our set, the distances from B to other points are:B to A: sB to C: sB to D: s√3Similarly for D:D to A: sD to C: sD to B: s√3So the third vertex for BD would need to be a point at distance s√3 from both B and D. The only points in the set are A, B, C, D. None of these are at distance s√3 from both B and D except maybe C? Distance from C to B is s, distance from C to D is s. So no. Similarly, A is at distance s from B and s√3 from D. So no. So there is no third vertex in the set for the pair B-D. Therefore, this configuration doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, the rhombus of four points doesn&#39;t work.Hmm, so n=4 might not be possible. Let me check another configuration. What if we take three points forming an equilateral triangle and then the fourth point is the center? But the center is not at the right distance. Wait, the centroid of an equilateral triangle is at a distance of (1/√3) times the height from each vertex. The height is (√3/2)s, so the centroid is at (√3/2)s*(1/√3) = s/2 from each vertex. So the distance from the centroid to each vertex is s/2, which is shorter than the side length s. Therefore, the pair consisting of a vertex and the centroid would have distance s/2, but there is no other point at distance s/2 to form an equilateral triangle. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work either.Alternatively, maybe a pyramid configuration? But in 2D, a pyramid is just a triangle with a point in the center. But as above, the distances don&#39;t work out.Alternatively, think of a larger structure. Maybe a hexagon as part of a hexagonal lattice? Let me consider a hexagon with six points. Wait, but the problem is asking for n &gt; 2, so maybe n=3, 4, 5, etc. Let me check n=6.Wait, in a regular hexagon, each pair of adjacent vertices is distance s apart, and the pairs separated by one vertex are distance s√3. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon with side length s, the distance between opposite vertices is 2s. The distance between adjacent vertices is s, and the distance between vertices with one in between is s√3. Wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, the distance between two vertices separated by two edges is 2s*sin(60°) = s√3. So yes, some pairs have distance s√3.But in order for any two points to form a side of an equilateral triangle, the third vertex must be present. Let&#39;s take two adjacent vertices in the hexagon: distance s. The third vertex needed is the one that forms an equilateral triangle with them. In the regular hexagon, is there such a point? If we take two adjacent vertices, say A and B, then the point that forms an equilateral triangle with them would be the one outside the hexagon, rotated 60 degrees from the side AB. But that point isn&#39;t part of the hexagon. Alternatively, inside the hexagon, but the center is at distance s/2 from each vertex, so that doesn&#39;t form an equilateral triangle. So, in a regular hexagon, two adjacent vertices don&#39;t have a third vertex in the set to form an equilateral triangle. Therefore, the regular hexagon doesn&#39;t work either.Hmm, maybe the problem requires a different kind of configuration. Let me think in terms of complex numbers. Maybe placing points on the complex plane at the roots of unity multiplied by some factor. For example, the third roots of unity would form an equilateral triangle. If we take sixth roots of unity, we get a regular hexagon. But as above, that doesn&#39;t work. Alternatively, maybe using a lattice generated by equilateral triangles.Wait, in an infinite triangular lattice, every pair of adjacent points has a third point forming an equilateral triangle. But the problem is about finite n. So perhaps the only finite configurations that work are the ones that are regular triangles (n=3) and maybe some symmetrical figures with higher n. But from the previous attempts, n=4 seems impossible. What about n=6? Maybe a hexagon with some additional points?Wait, let&#39;s think of the n=4 case again. Suppose we have four points: A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s say A, B, C form an equilateral triangle. Then, to satisfy the condition for the pair A-D, we need a point E such that ADE is equilateral. But E must be in the set. Similarly for B-D and C-D. So D must form equilateral triangles with each of A, B, C. But in 2D, given three non-collinear points, the number of points that form equilateral triangles with each pair might be limited. Wait, for each pair A-D, B-D, C-D, there are two possible positions for E each time (one on each side of the line). But to satisfy all three, D would have to be a special point. But in 2D, given three points, can there exist a fourth point that forms equilateral triangles with each of the three original points? Let&#39;s try to compute.Let’s place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), and point C at (0.5, √3/2). Now, we need to find a point D such that ADE is equilateral for each pair A-D, B-D, C-D. Wait, no, actually, for each pair (A,D), (B,D), (C,D), there needs to be a third point in the set forming an equilateral triangle. So for pair (A,D), there must be a point E in {A,B,C,D} such that ADE is equilateral. Similarly, for (B,D), there must be a point F in the set such that BDF is equilateral, and same for (C,D).But since we only have four points, E and F have to be among A,B,C,D. Let&#39;s try to find such a D.Suppose D is such that ADE is equilateral. So E must be either B, C, or D. If E is B, then ADB must be equilateral. But A is at (0,0), B is at (1,0). For ADB to be equilateral, D must be at (0.5, √3/2), which is point C. But then D would be C, which is already in the set. But then we would have E = B, D = C, but C is already present. So the triangle ADB would be ACB, which is equilateral. Wait, but if D is C, then we already have ABC as the triangle, and the pair A-C is part of triangle ABC. But the problem states that any two points must form a side of an equilateral triangle with the third vertex also in the set. So if D is C, then pair A-D (which is A-C) is part of triangle ABC, which is okay. Similarly, pair B-D (B-C) is part of triangle ABC. Pair C-D (C-C) which is not valid. Wait, D can&#39;t be C because we need four distinct points. So D must be a new point.Alternatively, suppose D is a different point. Let&#39;s try coordinates. Let’s denote A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2). Let’s look for a point D(x,y) such that for each pair (A,D), (B,D), (C,D), there is a third point in {A,B,C,D} forming an equilateral triangle.First, consider pair (A,D). There must exist a point E in {A,B,C,D} such that ADE is equilateral. Similarly, for pair (B,D), there must be F in the set such that BDF is equilateral, and for pair (C,D), there must be G in the set such that CDG is equilateral.Let’s attempt to find such a D.Let’s start by assuming that E is B for pair (A,D). Then triangle ADB must be equilateral. So D must be the third vertex of an equilateral triangle with A and B. There are two such points: (0.5, √3/2) which is point C, and (0.5, -√3/2). Since C is already in the set, D could be (0.5, -√3/2). Let’s check if this works.So D is (0.5, -√3/2). Now, check the pairs involving D:1. Pair A-D: A(0,0), D(0.5, -√3/2). The third vertex to form an equilateral triangle would be B(1,0), as we considered. So that&#39;s okay.2. Pair B-D: B(1,0), D(0.5, -√3/2). The third vertex to form an equilateral triangle could be a point F. Let&#39;s compute possible F.The third vertex can be obtained by rotating BD by 60 degrees around B or around D. Let&#39;s compute both possibilities.First, rotating BD around B by 60 degrees. The vector from B to D is (-0.5, -√3/2). Rotating this by 60 degrees clockwise: rotation matrix [cos(-60), -sin(-60); sin(-60), cos(-60)] = [0.5, √3/2; -√3/2, 0.5]. Multiplying this by the vector (-0.5, -√3/2):x&#39; = 0.5*(-0.5) + (√3/2)*(-√3/2) = -0.25 - (3/4) = -1y&#39; = (-√3/2)*(-0.5) + 0.5*(-√3/2) = (√3/4) - (√3/4) = 0So the new point is (1 - 1, 0 + 0) = (0, 0), which is point A. So triangle BDA is equilateral. But A is already in the set. So pair B-D forms triangle BDA with third vertex A. That works.Similarly, rotating BD around D by 60 degrees. The vector from D to B is (0.5, √3/2). Rotating this by 60 degrees clockwise:Using the same rotation matrix:x&#39; = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(√3/2) = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1y&#39; = (-√3/2)*0.5 + 0.5*(√3/2) = (-√3/4) + (√3/4) = 0So the new point is D + (1, 0) = (0.5 + 1, -√3/2 + 0) = (1.5, -√3/2). But this point is not in the set {A,B,C,D}. So the third vertex here is not in the set. So only A is available, which works.3. Pair C-D: C(0.5, √3/2), D(0.5, -√3/2). The third vertex needed to form an equilateral triangle with C and D. Let&#39;s compute possible third vertices.The distance between C and D is √[(0.5 - 0.5)^2 + (-√3/2 - √3/2)^2] = √[0 + (-√3)^2] = √[3] = √3. So the side length is √3. To form an equilateral triangle, the third vertex must be at distance √3 from both C and D. Let&#39;s find such points.The midpoint of CD is (0.5, 0). The third vertex lies on the perpendicular bisector of CD, which is the x-axis (y=0). The distance from the midpoint to the third vertex is (√3)/2 * √3 = 3/2. Wait, in an equilateral triangle with side length √3, the height is (√3/2)*√3 = 3/2. So the third vertex is either (0.5 + 3/2, 0) = (2, 0) or (0.5 - 3/2, 0) = (-1, 0). But neither of these points are in our set {A,B,C,D}. The points in the set are A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2), D(0.5, -√3/2). So neither (2,0) nor (-1,0) are in the set. Therefore, pair C-D does not have a third vertex in the set to form an equilateral triangle. Hence, this configuration doesn&#39;t satisfy the problem&#39;s condition.Therefore, even though we added point D, the pair C-D fails. So n=4 is not possible with this configuration.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another position for D. Let&#39;s try another approach. Suppose instead of taking E as B for pair A-D, maybe E is a new point. But since we are limited to four points, E has to be one of the existing ones. So E can only be B, C, or D. If E is D, then triangle ADD is degenerate, which is invalid. So E must be B or C.If E is C, then triangle ADC must be equilateral. So point D must be such that distance AD = AC = s and angle at A is 60 degrees. But AC is already length s, so D would have to be a rotation of C around A by 60 degrees. Let&#39;s compute that.Original points: A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2). Rotating C around A by 60 degrees clockwise. The rotation matrix is [cos(-60), -sin(-60); sin(-60), cos(-60)] = [0.5, √3/2; -√3/2, 0.5]. Applying this to vector AC = (0.5, √3/2):x&#39; = 0.5*0.5 + (√3/2)*(√3/2) = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1y&#39; = -√3/2*0.5 + 0.5*(√3/2) = -√3/4 + √3/4 = 0So the rotated point is (1, 0), which is point B. But that&#39;s already in the set. So rotating C around A by 60 degrees gives B. So if we set D as B, but B is already in the set. So that doesn&#39;t add a new point.Alternatively, rotating C around A by 60 degrees counterclockwise. Rotation matrix [cos(60), -sin(60); sin(60), cos(60)] = [0.5, -√3/2; √3/2, 0.5]. Applying this to vector AC (0.5, √3/2):x&#39; = 0.5*0.5 + (-√3/2)*(√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5y&#39; = √3/2*0.5 + 0.5*(√3/2) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2So the point is (-0.5, √3/2). Let&#39;s call this point D. Now, check the pairs involving D:1. Pair A-D: A(0,0), D(-0.5, √3/2). To form an equilateral triangle, the third vertex must be C, because rotating AD by 60 degrees around A should give a point in the set. Wait, but C is at (0.5, √3/2). Alternatively, rotating D around A by 60 degrees:Using rotation matrix for 60 degrees:x&#39;&#39; = 0.5*(-0.5) - √3/2*(√3/2) = -0.25 - 3/4 = -1y&#39;&#39; = √3/2*(-0.5) + 0.5*(√3/2) = -√3/4 + √3/4 = 0So the point is (-1, 0), which is not in the set. So the third vertex isn&#39;t in the set. Therefore, pair A-D does not have a third vertex in the set. Hence, this configuration doesn&#39;t work.This is getting complicated. Maybe n=4 is impossible. Let&#39;s try to think of another approach. Maybe the problem requires that the set of points forms a closed system under the operation of completing equilateral triangles. If so, such a system might need to be infinite or have specific symmetries.Wait, if we consider complex numbers, suppose the points are the third roots of unity, so n=3. That works. For n=6, maybe the sixth roots of unity? Let&#39;s see. The sixth roots of unity are at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°. Let&#39;s check if any two points form a side of an equilateral triangle with another point.Take two adjacent points, say at 0° and 60°. The distance between them is 2*sin(30°) = 1 (assuming radius 1). The third point to form an equilateral triangle would be at 30°, but that&#39;s not a sixth root of unity. Alternatively, rotating one point around the other by 60°. Wait, but maybe not. Let&#39;s take specific points. Let&#39;s label them A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°.Take points A0 and A1. To form an equilateral triangle, the third point should be such that the triangle A0A1X is equilateral. The possible X would be at 0° + 60° rotation from A0A1. The vector from A0 to A1 is (cos60 - 1, sin60 - 0) = (-0.5, √3/2). Rotating this vector by 60° around A0 gives:Using rotation matrix:x&#39; = (-0.5)*cos60 - (√3/2)*sin60 = (-0.5)(0.5) - (√3/2)(√3/2) = -0.25 - 0.75 = -1y&#39; = (-0.5)*sin60 + (√3/2)*cos60 = (-0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = -√3/4 + √3/4 = 0So the new point is A0 + (-1, 0) = (-1, 0), which is A3 (180°). So triangle A0A1A3 is equilateral. But A3 is in the set. So pair A0A1 can form a triangle with A3. Similarly, pair A0A3: distance 2 (diameter), so to form an equilateral triangle, the third point would need to be at distance 2 from both A0 and A3. But in the unit circle, the maximum distance is 2 (diameter). The third point would be at 60° or 300°, but those are at distance 1 from the center, so distance from A0 (1,0) to (cos60, sin60) is √[(0.5-1)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[0.25 + 0.75] = √1 = 1. So distance 1 from A0 and distance √[(cos60 - (-1))^2 + (sin60)^2] = √[(1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[2.25 + 0.75] = √3. So not equal to 2. Therefore, pair A0A3 cannot form an equilateral triangle with any other point in the set. Therefore, the sixth roots of unity do not satisfy the condition.Hmm, this is tricky. Let&#39;s consider another approach. Maybe the only possible n is 3. But the problem says &quot;find all n ∈ N, greater than 2&quot;, so maybe 3 is the only one? But I need to verify.Wait, the problem is from SFRY, 76, which might be an olympiad problem. Maybe the answer is all multiples of 3? Or powers of 3? Wait, no. Let&#39;s think.Alternatively, maybe the configuration is a larger equilateral triangle subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles. For example, a tetrahedral configuration in 2D. Wait, but a subdivided equilateral triangle grid would have many points, but any two points might not necessarily form a side of an equilateral triangle with another point in the set. For example, in a grid of small equilateral triangles, two adjacent points form a small triangle, but two points that are further apart might not have a third point completing the triangle.Alternatively, consider the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, but in 3D. However, the problem specifies a plane, so 2D. So that&#39;s not applicable.Wait, another thought: if we have n points arranged such that they form the vertices of a regular n-gon with the property that for any two vertices, there exists a third vertex such that the three form an equilateral triangle. For which n would this be possible?In a regular n-gon, the distance between two vertices depends on how many edges they are apart. For an equilateral triangle to exist, the arc between the two vertices should correspond to a 120° angle, since in a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So, if two vertices are k edges apart, the central angle is 360k/n degrees. For them to form an equilateral triangle, the central angle between each pair should be 120°, so 360k/n = 120°, which implies k/n = 1/3, so n must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, if n is divisible by 3, then there exist pairs of vertices separated by 120°, and the third vertex would be another 120° around. So, for example, in a regular hexagon (n=6), each pair of vertices separated by two edges form a 120° angle, so those three vertices form an equilateral triangle. But in the regular hexagon, adjacent vertices are 60° apart, so two adjacent vertices would need a third vertex at 60° from each, but that&#39;s not present in the hexagon. Therefore, even in a regular hexagon, not all pairs satisfy the condition. Only those pairs separated by two edges do. Therefore, regular n-gon with n divisible by 3 gives some equilateral triangles, but not all pairs.Therefore, this approach might not solve the problem.Wait, maybe the only solution is n=3. Because in any larger n, we can&#39;t satisfy the condition for all pairs. For example, in n=4, as we saw, it&#39;s impossible. For n=6, even if some pairs form equilateral triangles, not all do. So maybe the answer is only n=3.But let me check another configuration for n=7. Wait, that seems even more complicated. Alternatively, maybe there is a configuration with n=7, but I can&#39;t think of it.Alternatively, think about the complex plane again. Suppose we have the third roots of unity, which works for n=3. If we take the union of multiple equilateral triangles rotated relative to each other, maybe we can get a larger set. For example, take the original triangle A,B,C, and then add another triangle A,D,E, rotated by some angle. But this might not ensure that all pairs have the required third vertex.Alternatively, consider the vertices of a star-shaped figure. For example, the Star of David, which is two overlapping equilateral triangles. This has six points. Let&#39;s see if this works. The Star of David consists of two equilateral triangles, one pointing up and one pointing down, forming a hexagram. The vertices are the six points of the hexagram. Let&#39;s label them A, B, C, D, E, F, where A, C, E form the upward triangle, and B, D, F form the downward triangle.Now, check if any two points form a side of an equilateral triangle with a third point in the set.Take points A and B. The distance between them depends on the exact construction. In a regular hexagram (which is composed of two equilateral triangles), the distance between adjacent points (like A and B) is equal to the side length of the triangles. Wait, in a regular hexagram, each triangle is equilateral, and the intersection points form a regular hexagon. The distance between A and B (adjacent vertices of the star) is equal to the side length of the small triangles, but the distance from A to C (a vertex of the larger triangle) is twice that. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complex. Let me assign coordinates.Let’s place point A at (0,0), point B at (1,0), point C at (2,0), but arranged in a star. Wait, perhaps a better coordinate system. Let&#39;s consider the Star of David as two overlapping equilateral triangles. Let’s have one triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0.5, √3/2) and the other triangle rotated 180 degrees, with vertices at (0.5, √3/6), (0.5, -√3/6), and some other points. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe it&#39;s better to use complex numbers.Let’s define the six vertices of the Star of David as follows: the third roots of unity and their multiples by e^{iπ} (rotation by 180 degrees). So points are at e^{i2πk/3} and e^{i2πk/3 + iπ} for k=0,1,2. So these are the points 1, e^{i2π/3}, e^{i4π/3}, -1, -e^{i2π/3}, -e^{i4π/3}.Let’s check the distance between 1 and e^{i2π/3}. The distance is |1 - e^{i2π/3}| = √[(1 - cos(2π/3))^2 + (sin(2π/3))^2] = √[(1 - (-0.5))^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[(1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[2.25 + 0.75] = √3. So the distance between adjacent points in the star is √3. The third point needed to form an equilateral triangle with 1 and e^{i2π/3} would be a point at distance √3 from both. Let’s compute it. The two points are 1 (1,0) and e^{i2π/3} (-0.5, √3/2). The third vertex can be found by rotating one point around the other by 60 degrees. Let&#39;s rotate 1 around e^{i2π/3} by 60 degrees. Alternatively, since this is getting too calculation-heavy, maybe just check if such a third vertex exists in the set. The possible third vertices are -1, -e^{i2π/3}, -e^{i4π/3}. Let&#39;s compute the distance from 1 to -e^{i2π/3}: |1 - (-e^{i2π/3})| = |1 + e^{i2π/3}|. Compute this:e^{i2π/3} = -0.5 + i√3/2, so -e^{i2π/3} = 0.5 - i√3/2.Adding 1: 1 + 0.5 - i√3/2 = 1.5 - i√3/2.The magnitude is √[(1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[2.25 + 0.75] = √3. So the distance between 1 and -e^{i2π/3} is √3. Similarly, the distance between e^{i2π/3} and -1: |e^{i2π/3} - (-1)| = |e^{i2π/3} + 1| = same as above, √3. So the triangle formed by 1, e^{i2π/3}, and -1 has all sides equal to √3. Therefore, it&#39;s an equilateral triangle. Therefore, in the Star of David (hexagram), the pair 1 and e^{i2π/3} forms a side of the equilateral triangle with third vertex -1. Similarly, other pairs would form triangles with third vertices.But wait, let&#39;s verify all pairs. Take two points 1 and -1. The distance between them is 2. To form an equilateral triangle, we need a third point at distance 2 from both 1 and -1. The only other points in the set are e^{i2π/3}, e^{i4π/3}, -e^{i2π/3}, -e^{i4π/3}. The distance from 1 to e^{i2π/3} is √3, not 2. Similarly, distance from -1 to e^{i2π/3} is √[( -1 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - √3/2)^2] = √[(-0.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[0.25 + 0.75] = 1. So no, the distance is 1. Therefore, pair 1 and -1 cannot form an equilateral triangle with any third point in the set. Therefore, the Star of David doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition for all pairs.Therefore, even the hexagram fails. This is frustrating. Maybe the only possible n is 3.But the problem states &quot;greater than 2&quot;, so n=3 is allowed, but are there others? Maybe infinitely many? But the problem asks to find all n ∈ N greater than 2. Maybe it&#39;s possible for all n ≡ 0 mod 3, but I don&#39;t see how.Wait, another idea. If we can have a set of points where every pair is part of an equilateral triangle within the set, then the set must be such that for any two points, the third vertex required is also present. This resembles the concept of a &quot;group&quot; or &quot;closed under an operation&quot;, but in geometry. In 3D, we can have a regular tetrahedron, where each edge is part of three different equilateral triangles (the faces). But in 2D, we can&#39;t have such a configuration. The only 2D figure where each pair forms a side of a triangle is the triangle itself. For higher n, it&#39;s impossible because each new point would need to form triangles with all existing points, leading to an exponential increase in required points, which can&#39;t be embedded in a plane.Wait, but maybe the problem allows multiple triangles to share edges. For example, in 3D, a tetrahedron has four vertices, each pair forming an edge of a triangle. But in 2D, we can&#39;t have four points where every pair forms an edge of a triangle. Wait, in a complete graph K4, every pair is an edge, but in 2D, we can&#39;t have four points where every triple forms a triangle. But the problem is not requiring every triple to form a triangle, but rather that for every pair, there exists at least one third point to form a triangle.So, even if multiple pairs share the same third point, it&#39;s okay. For example, in a configuration where three points form a triangle, and the fourth point forms triangles with two of them, but not all. But in our previous attempts, this didn&#39;t work because some pairs didn&#39;t have a third point.Wait, maybe a recursive approach. Start with a triangle, then for each new point, add it such that it forms triangles with existing points. But this might require an infinite number of points.Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of graph theory. The set of points is a graph where each edge is part of at least one triangle (equilateral). The question is asking for which n there exists such a graph embedded in the plane with all edges of equal length (since all edges are sides of equilateral triangles). Wait, but the edges don&#39;t have to be of the same length, only that each pair of points has some third point forming an equilateral triangle. So the edges can be of different lengths, as long as for each edge, there is a third point forming an equilateral triangle.Wait, but in that case, maybe you can have multiple equilateral triangles of different sizes. For example, two different equilateral triangles with different side lengths, arranged such that their vertices satisfy the condition. But this seems complicated.Alternatively, consider a set of points arranged in such a way that every pair of points has a third point at the same distance, rotated 60 degrees. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;rotational closure&quot;. For example, the Moser spindle, a graph used in the proof of the chromatic number of the plane, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s directly applicable here.Wait, let&#39;s try constructing a set with n=4. Suppose we have two equilateral triangles sharing a common base. So imagine points A, B, C forming an equilateral triangle, and points A, B, D forming another equilateral triangle on the other side of AB. So we have a tetrahedron-like shape in 2D, which is actually a bowtie made of two triangles. Now, check the pairs:A-B: part of both triangles ABC and ABD. So third vertices are C and D.A-C: part of triangle ABC, third vertex B.A-D: part of triangle ABD, third vertex B.B-C: part of triangle ABC, third vertex A.B-D: part of triangle ABD, third vertex A.C-D: The distance between C and D. Let&#39;s compute it. If ABC and ABD are equilateral triangles with side length s, then points C and D are reflections over AB. The distance between C and D is 2*(height of the triangle) = 2*(s*√3/2) = s√3. To form an equilateral triangle with C and D, we need a third point at distance s√3 from both C and D. The existing points are A, B. Distance from A to C is s, from A to D is s, from B to C is s, from B to D is s. So no existing point is at distance s√3 from both C and D. Therefore, pair C-D does not have a third vertex, so this configuration fails.Therefore, n=4 seems impossible. Given all these failed attempts, maybe the only possible value is n=3. Is there a known mathematical result about this?Wait, recalling that this problem is similar to a problem in combinatorial geometry called the &quot;no-three-collinear&quot; problem but with equilateral triangles. However, I recall a specific problem called the &quot;Erdős–Rényi–Sós problem&quot; or similar, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, the concept of a &quot;unit distance graph&quot; where edges are unit length, but here it&#39;s more specific: every edge must be part of an equilateral triangle.Alternatively, considering that in the plane, the only finite set of points with the property that every pair is part of an equilateral triangle is the three vertices of an equilateral triangle. Any larger set would require an infinite number of points, like a triangular lattice. But the problem asks for finite n.Alternatively, maybe n can be any multiple of 3, but I can&#39;t see how. For example, n=6: take two equilateral triangles of different sizes, arranged such that each pair of points from different triangles can form a triangle with another point. But this seems too vague.Wait, another approach: if such a set S exists, then S must be a collection of equilateral triangles that share edges such that every pair of points in S is connected by an edge of some equilateral triangle in S. This is similar to a graph being the union of triangles covering all edges.In graph theory, such a graph is called &quot;triangle-covered&quot;. For example, the complete graph K3 is triangle-covered. For higher n, the complete graph Kn is not triangle-covered unless n=3. But in geometry, we have more constraints because the edges must correspond to equilateral triangles in the plane.Therefore, maybe the only such graph that can be embedded in the plane with all edges as sides of equilateral triangles is K3. Hence, n=3 is the only solution.Alternatively, if we allow different edge lengths, maybe we can have more points. For example, suppose we have two equilateral triangles with different side lengths, connected in some way. But then, the pairs of points from different triangles would have distances that may not correspond to any equilateral triangle with a third point.Given that all my attempts to construct a configuration with n&gt;3 fail, and given that the problem is from an olympiad, which often has elegant solutions, I think the answer is that the only possible n is 3. Therefore, the values of n are all natural numbers equal to 3. Wait, but the problem says &quot;greater than 2&quot;, so n=3 is the only solution.But wait, let me check once more. Is there a configuration with seven points? For example, the vertices of a regular heptagon with some properties? Unlikely, as regular polygons with n&gt;3 don&#39;t have the required property.Alternatively, maybe something like the seven-pointed star or other figures. But this is too vague.Alternatively, considering a three-dimensional structure projected onto a plane. But the problem specifies &quot;on a plane&quot;, so it must be planar.Given all this, I think the only solution is n=3. So the answer is boxed{3}.Final Answerboxed{3}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem of finding all values of ( n in mathbf{N} ) greater than 2 for which it is possible to select ( n ) points on a plane such that any two of them are vertices of an equilateral triangle with the third vertex also among the selected points, we start by examining small values of ( n ).1. For ( n = 3 ):   - Three points forming an equilateral triangle satisfy the condition. Each pair of points forms a side of the triangle, and the third vertex is the remaining point. Thus, ( n = 3 ) works.2. For ( n = 4 ):   - We attempt various configurations such as a rhombus, square, and other geometric shapes, but find that it is impossible to place four points such that every pair forms a side of an equilateral triangle with a third point in the set. For example, adding a fourth point to an equilateral triangle results in pairs that cannot form an equilateral triangle with any existing point.3. For ( n &gt; 4 ):   - We consider configurations like regular hexagons, star-shaped figures, and other complex structures. However, these configurations fail to satisfy the condition for all pairs of points. The key issue is that any additional point beyond three introduces pairs that do not have a corresponding third vertex to form an equilateral triangle.4. General Considerations:   - The problem requires a set of points closed under the operation of completing an equilateral triangle for any pair. This closure property is inherently satisfied by a three-point equilateral triangle but fails for larger sets due to geometric constraints in the plane.After thorough consideration of various configurations and verifying that all pairs must form an equilateral triangle with a third point, it is concluded that the only solution is ( n = 3 ).[boxed{3}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>12.10. We will prove that the condition of the problem is satisfied only by the value n=3 (in which case the points can be placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle). Indeed, suppose that it is possible to arrange n geqslant 4 points in the manner specified in the problem. We select two points A and B, the distance between which is maximal, and a third point C, such that the triangle A B C is equilateral. Then all the other points lie within the figure M, which is the intersection of three circles of radius A B centered at points A, B, and C (Fig. 68). If point O is the center of the triangle A B C, then the segments A O, B O, and C O divide the set M into three equal parts, none of which can contain any of the n points, except those already mentioned. Indeed, suppose, for example, that part M_{B C}, consisting of the triangle B O C and the segment of the circle centered at A with the arc B C, contains another point D. Then there exists a point D^{prime} such that the triangle A D D^{prime} is equilateral. Consequently, when rotating (in a certain direction) around point A by an angle of 60^{circ}, point D transitions to point D^{prime}, which thus lies simultaneously in the image M_{B C}^{prime} of part M_{B C} under this rotation and in the set M. But since angle B A C=60^{circ}, either C^{prime}=B or B^{prime}=C. For definiteness, assume that B^{prime}=C. Then the sets M_{B C}^{prime} and M lie in different half-planes relative to the line B^{prime} O^{prime}, becauseangle B B^{prime} O^{prime}=angle B C A+angle A B^{prime} O^{prime}=60^{circ}+30^{circ}=90^{circ},i.e., the line B^{prime} O^{prime} is tangent to the arc A C. Therefore, M_{B C}^{prime} and M have only one common point B^{prime}, from which it follows that D^{prime}=B^{prime} and D=B, which contradicts the choice of point D. The statement is proved.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-79b7f219 data-v-a10afc05><div class="review" data-v-a10afc05><div class="review-title" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>❓:</span>For every integer n	ge 2 let B_n denote the set of all binary n-nuples of zeroes and ones, and split B_n into equivalence classes by letting two n-nuples be equivalent if one is obtained from the another by a cyclic permutation.(for example 110, 011 and 101 are equivalent).

The question is asking for which integers n ≥ 2, the set B_n splits into an odd number of equivalence classes. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. B_n is the set of all binary strings of length n. Each element in B_n is an n-tuple of 0s and 1s. We&#39;re supposed to consider two n-tuples equivalent if one can be cyclically permuted to get the other. For example, 110, 011, and 101 are all equivalent because you can rotate them into each other. So, the equivalence classes here are the orbits under the action of cyclic permutations. Then, the task is to find all n ≥ 2 where the number of these equivalence classes is odd.Alright, so the key here is to compute the number of equivalence classes, which is the number of distinct necklaces with n beads where each bead can be either black or white (0 or 1). Necklace problems are classic in combinatorics, often approached using Burnside&#39;s lemma from group theory, which counts the number of orbits by averaging the number of fixed points of the group actions.Burnside&#39;s lemma states that the number of orbits (equivalence classes) is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group&#39;s elements. In this case, the group is the cyclic group of order n, generated by a cyclic shift. So, the group elements are the rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 positions. The number of fixed points of each rotation is the number of binary strings that are unchanged when rotated by that number of positions.Therefore, the formula for the number of necklaces (equivalence classes) N(n) is:N(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}Where φ is Euler&#39;s totient function, and the sum is over all divisors d of n. This is because for each divisor d of n, there are φ(d) group elements (rotations) of order d, and each such rotation has 2^{n/d} fixed binary strings. The fixed strings under rotation by d positions are those that repeat every d positions, hence consisting of n/d copies of a binary string of length d. Therefore, there are 2^d such strings, but since d must divide n, we write it as 2^{n/d}? Wait, maybe I need to think carefully here.Wait, no. Let me re-examine the fixed points. If we have a rotation by k positions, then the number of fixed points is the number of binary strings that are invariant under a rotation by k. The rotation by k generates a cyclic subgroup of order d, where d is the gcd(k, n). Therefore, the number of fixed points under rotation by k is 2^{d}, since the string must be composed of d repetitions of a substring of length n/d. Wait, perhaps that&#39;s where the confusion is.Actually, if a rotation by k has order d (so d = n / gcd(n, k)), then the number of fixed points under this rotation is 2^{gcd(n, k)}. Because the string must consist of gcd(n, k) repetitions of a substring of length d. Since each of these d positions can be chosen independently, there are 2^d possibilities. Wait, no. Wait, if the rotation by k splits the necklace into gcd(n, k) cycles, each of length d = n / gcd(n, k). Therefore, each cycle must be the same, so the number of fixed points is 2^{gcd(n, k)}. Hmm, I might need to verify this.Alternatively, according to Burnside&#39;s lemma, the number of necklaces is (1/n) * Σ_{k=1}^n 2^{gcd(n,k)}. Because for each rotation k (from 1 to n), the number of fixed points is 2^{gcd(n,k)}. Then, this sum can be simplified by grouping terms by the value of gcd(n,k). For each divisor d of n, there are φ(n/d) values of k such that gcd(n,k) = d. Wait, let me see.Wait, suppose d is a divisor of n. Then, the number of integers k between 1 and n such that gcd(n, k) = d is equal to φ(n/d). Because if we set k = d * m, then gcd(n, d*m) = d implies that gcd(n/d, m) = 1. So, m must be between 1 and n/d, and coprime to n/d. Hence, there are φ(n/d) such m. Therefore, the total number of fixed points is Σ_{d|n} φ(n/d) * 2^d. Therefore, the number of necklaces is (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}, because when you substitute d with n/d, since d divides n, then n/d is also a divisor. Wait, hold on, let&#39;s check this.If we set d = gcd(n, k), then for each divisor d of n, the number of k with gcd(n, k) = d is φ(n/d). Then, the total fixed points would be Σ_{d|n} φ(n/d) * 2^d. Therefore, the number of necklaces would be (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(n/d) * 2^d. But φ(n/d) is the same as φ(n / d), so if we let e = n/d, then d = n/e, and as d runs over the divisors of n, e also runs over the divisors of n. So, Σ_{e|n} φ(e) * 2^{n/e}. Therefore, the number of necklaces is (1/n) * Σ_{e|n} φ(e) * 2^{n/e}. So that&#39;s the formula.Therefore, N(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}.So, the problem reduces to determining for which n ≥ 2, N(n) is odd.Therefore, we need to compute N(n) modulo 2 and find n where this is 1.So, the problem is now: find all integers n ≥ 2 such that (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} is odd.But since we are working modulo 2, perhaps we can analyze the sum Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} modulo 2n? Because we have to divide by n. However, since we are dealing with parity, we need the sum Σ φ(d) * 2^{n/d} to be congruent to n modulo 2n. Because when we divide by n, the result is an integer. So, if Σ φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n, then N(n) ≡ 1 mod 2.Alternatively, since N(n) is an integer, and we need N(n) ≡ 1 mod 2, which means Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n. Because (1/n)*Σ ... ≡ 1 mod 2 implies Σ ... ≡ n mod 2n.Therefore, we need to find n such that Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to analyze the sum modulo 2. But n is in the denominator, so maybe we can write the sum as n * N(n), and then compute n * N(n) modulo 2. Wait, but since n can be even or odd, maybe we need to handle different cases.Wait, let&#39;s consider that N(n) must be odd. So, N(n) is (sum)/(n), so the sum must be congruent to n modulo 2n, as I thought before. Alternatively, since N(n) is an integer, sum = n * N(n). Therefore, if N(n) is odd, then sum = n * (2k + 1) = n + 2kn. Therefore, sum ≡ n mod 2n. Hence, sum ≡ n mod 2n. So, sum ≡ n mod 2n. So, sum ≡ n mod 2n implies that sum ≡ n mod 2, since 2n divides (sum - n) implies 2 divides (sum - n). Therefore, sum ≡ n mod 2. But sum is Σ φ(d) * 2^{n/d}. Let&#39;s compute this modulo 2.But 2^{n/d} is congruent to 0 mod 2 when n/d ≥ 1, which it always is. Wait, 2^{n/d} is 0 mod 2 except when n/d = 0, which is impossible. Wait, but 2^{n/d} is even except when n/d = 0, which can&#39;t happen. Wait, hold on. If n/d is at least 1, since d divides n, so n/d is integer ≥1, so 2^{n/d} is even except when n/d = 1, which would mean d = n. So, 2^{n/d} is even except when d = n. Because if d = n, then n/d = 1, so 2^{1} = 2, which is even. Wait, no, 2^1 is 2, which is even. So all terms in the sum Σ φ(d) * 2^{n/d} are even, except possibly when φ(d) is odd. But φ(d) is even for all d ≥ 3, and φ(1) = 1, φ(2) = 1. So φ(d) is odd only when d = 1 or d = 2.But in our sum, d divides n. So, if n is odd, then d = 1 is the only divisor where φ(d) is odd. If n is even, then d = 1 and d = 2 would have φ(d) odd.Therefore, let&#39;s separate cases based on whether n is even or odd.Case 1: n is odd. Then, divisors d of n can be 1 and other odd numbers. For each odd d ≥ 3, φ(d) is even. For d = 1, φ(1) = 1. So, Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} = φ(1)*2^{n/1} + Σ_{d|n, d ≥3} φ(d)*2^{n/d} = 2^n + Σ_{d|n, d ≥3} even * even. Because φ(d) is even and 2^{n/d} is even (since n/d ≥1, as d ≥3 and n is odd, n/d is at least 1, so 2^{n/d} is even). Therefore, each term in the sum is even, and the entire sum is 2^n + even + even + ... = even + even = even. Therefore, the total sum is even. Then, since n is odd, the sum ≡ even ≡ 0 mod 2. But we needed sum ≡ n mod 2. Since n is odd, sum ≡ 0 ≡ 1 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, sum is even, so sum ≡ 0 mod 2. But n is odd, so n ≡ 1 mod 2. Therefore, 0 ≡ 1 mod 2 is false. Therefore, when n is odd, sum ≡ 0 mod 2, but n ≡ 1 mod 2. Hence, sum ≡ n mod 2 is false. Therefore, N(n) = sum / n. Since sum is even and n is odd, sum / n is even / odd. But even divided by odd is not necessarily integer, but in this case, sum is divisible by n, so sum / n is integer. But in terms of parity, even / odd is even. Therefore, N(n) is even when n is odd. Therefore, for odd n, N(n) is even, so they can&#39;t be solutions. Therefore, possible solutions must be even n.Case 2: n is even. Then, the divisors d of n include 1, 2, and other even or odd divisors. Let&#39;s analyze the sum Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}. Let&#39;s separate the terms where d = 1, d = 2, and d ≥3.For d = 1: φ(1) = 1, 2^{n/1} = 2^n. So, term is 2^n.For d = 2: φ(2) = 1, 2^{n/2}. So, term is 2^{n/2}.For d ≥3: If d is even, φ(d) is even if d ≥ 2. For example, φ(4)=2, φ(6)=2, etc. If d is odd, since n is even and d divides n, d must be even? Wait, no. If n is even, d can be odd or even. For example, n = 6 is even, divisors include 1, 2, 3, 6. So, d = 3 is odd. φ(3) = 2, which is even. Similarly, φ(6) = 2, which is even. So for d ≥3, regardless of whether d is even or odd, φ(d) is even. Therefore, for d ≥3, φ(d) is even, and 2^{n/d} is even (since n/d ≥1, because d ≤n). So, the term φ(d)*2^{n/d} is even * even = even. Therefore, all terms for d ≥3 are even.Therefore, the total sum is 2^n + 2^{n/2} + even terms. So, modulo 2, this sum is (0 + 0 + 0) ≡ 0 mod 2. But we need sum ≡ n mod 2. Since n is even, n ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore, sum ≡ n mod 2. So, sum ≡ 0 ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore, this condition is satisfied. However, we need to go further because we need sum ≡ n mod 2n, not just mod 2. But since we are dealing with N(n) = sum / n being odd, which requires sum ≡ n mod 2n. Wait, but how do we compute sum mod 2n?Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if n is a power of 2, then the sum might have specific properties.Wait, let&#39;s test with small n.Let me check small even n:n = 2:Divisors: 1, 2Sum: φ(1)*2^{2/1} + φ(2)*2^{2/2} = 1*4 + 1*2 = 6N(2) = 6 / 2 = 3, which is odd. So, n=2 is good.n=4:Divisors:1,2,4Sum: φ(1)*2^4 + φ(2)*2^2 + φ(4)*2^1 = 1*16 + 1*4 + 2*2 = 16 +4 +4=24N(4)=24/4=6, which is even. So, n=4 is bad.n=6:Divisors:1,2,3,6Sum:1*64 +1*8 + 2*4 + 2*2 =64+8+8+4=84N(6)=84/6=14, which is even.n=8:Divisors:1,2,4,8Sum:1*256 +1*16 +2*4 +4*2 =256+16+8+8=288N(8)=288/8=36, even.n=3 (odd): sum= φ(1)*8 + φ(3)*2=8 +2*2=12; N(3)=12/3=4, even. As expected.n=1 is not considered.n=5 (odd): sum= φ(1)*32 + φ(5)*2=32 +4*2=40; N(5)=40/5=8, even.Wait, so n=2 gives 3, which is odd. What about n=6, which is even, gives 14 even. Hmm. Let me check n=1: Not applicable. n=2 is the only even n so far that works. Wait, let&#39;s check n=6, but let&#39;s see n=2:Wait, n=2: {00, 01, 10, 11}. The equivalence classes are {00}, {01,10}, {11}. So 3 classes, which is odd.n=4: The number is 6, which is even. So classes are 6.Wait, perhaps n=2 is the only one? But maybe higher n?Wait, let&#39;s check n=8: N(n)=36, even. n=16: Let&#39;s compute N(16). That might take time, but perhaps we can find a pattern.Alternatively, perhaps n is a power of 2. Wait, n=2 is 2^1, and it works. n=4 is 2^2, doesn&#39;t work. So maybe only n=2. Hmm. Wait, but maybe other even numbers?Wait, let&#39;s check n=6. N(6)=14, even. n=10:Divisors of 10:1,2,5,10Sum: φ(1)*2^10 + φ(2)*2^5 + φ(5)*2^2 + φ(10)*2^1 =1*1024 +1*32 +4*4 +4*2=1024+32+16+8=1080N(10)=1080/10=108, which is even.Hmm. So even n=10, N(n)=108 even.Wait, n=2: works. Let&#39;s check n=1? But n must be ≥2.Wait, perhaps n=2 is the only even number where N(n) is odd. But wait, let&#39;s check n=6 again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me verify n=6:N(6)= (1/6)(φ(1)*2^6 + φ(2)*2^3 + φ(3)*2^2 + φ(6)*2^1 )φ(1)=1, φ(2)=1, φ(3)=2, φ(6)=2.Thus:(1/6)(64 + 8 + 4*2 + 2*2) = (64 +8 +8 +4)/6 = 84/6=14. Yes, 14 is even.n=2: sum=6, 6/2=3 odd.n=3: sum=12, 12/3=4 even.n=4: sum=24, 24/4=6 even.n=5: sum=40, 40/5=8 even.n=6: sum=84, 84/6=14 even.n=7: divisors 1,7. Sum=φ(1)*2^7 + φ(7)*2^1=128 +6*2=140. N(7)=140/7=20 even.n=8: sum=288, 288/8=36 even.n=9: divisors 1,3,9. Sum=φ(1)*512 + φ(3)*64 + φ(9)*2. φ(1)=1, φ(3)=2, φ(9)=6. So 512 + 2*64 + 6*2=512+128+12=652. N(9)=652/9≈72.444, which is not integer. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Wait, φ(3)=2, 2^{9/3}=2^3=8. So φ(3)*2^{9/3}=2*8=16. φ(9)=6, 2^{9/9}=2^1=2, so 6*2=12. So total sum=512 +16 +12=540. Therefore, N(9)=540/9=60, which is even. So that&#39;s correct.So n=9: N(n)=60 even.n=10: as before, N(n)=108 even.So seems like n=2 is the only one so far where N(n) is odd. Let&#39;s check n=1: Not allowed. So maybe the only solution is n=2? But wait, let&#39;s check n=0: Not in the domain. Hmm.Wait, maybe n=2 is the only even number where the number of necklaces is odd. But why? Let me try to analyze the formula again.For even n, the sum Σ φ(d) * 2^{n/d} = 2^n + 2^{n/2} + sum_{d|n, d≥3} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}We need this sum divided by n to be odd. So sum ≡ n mod 2n. Since n is even, let&#39;s write n=2^k * m, where m is odd. Maybe considering the highest power of 2 dividing n.But perhaps instead, look at the sum modulo 2n. Let&#39;s see for n=2:Sum=6. 6 ≡ 6 mod 4 (since 2n=4). 6 mod 4=2, which is not equal to n=2. Wait, but earlier I thought that sum ≡ n mod 2n is required. But for n=2, sum=6, 6 mod 4=2, which is equal to n=2. So 6 ≡2 mod 4. Indeed, 6-2=4, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, sum ≡n mod 2n holds. Therefore, N(n)=sum/n=6/2=3≡1 mod2.For n=4:sum=24. 24 mod 8=0. n=4. 0 ≡4 mod8? No. 24-4=20, which is not divisible by8. Therefore, sum≡0≠4 mod8. Therefore, sum≡n mod2n is false.Similarly, for n=6: sum=84. 2n=12. 84 mod12=0. n=6. 0≡6 mod12? No. So sum≡0≡6 mod12? No. Therefore, it&#39;s false.So for n=2, sum ≡n mod2n is true. For higher even n, sum ≡0 mod2n, which is different from n. Hence, n=2 is the only even number where sum≡n mod2n, leading to N(n)=sum/n≡1 mod2.But why is that? Let&#39;s analyze the sum Σ φ(d) *2^{n/d} modulo2n for even n.First, when n=2:sum=φ(1)*4 + φ(2)*2=4 +2=6≡6 mod4=2≡2 mod4, which is equal to n=2. So 6≡2 mod4, which is 6-2=4≡0 mod4. So yes.For n=4:sum=φ(1)*16 + φ(2)*4 + φ(4)*2=16 +4 +4=24≡24 mod8=0≡4 mod8? No, 0≠4. So not congruent.For n=6:sum=84≡84 mod12=0≡6 mod12? No.For n=8:sum=288≡288 mod16=0≡8 mod16? No.So only n=2 satisfies sum≡n mod2n. Therefore, n=2 is the only even n where N(n) is odd.But let me confirm with another even n, say n=14.But calculating N(14) would take time. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here.Alternatively, suppose that for n=2, sum=6=2*3, which is 2n * (3/2). Wait, n=2, sum=6=3n. 3n≡n mod2n? 3n -n=2n, which is 0 mod2n. Yes, 3n≡n mod2n. Therefore, sum=3n≡n mod2n. Therefore, N(n)=3n/n=3, which is odd.For n=4, sum=24=6n. 6n≡6n-4n=2n≡0 mod2n. Therefore, sum≡0 mod2n. Therefore, N(n)=6n/n=6≡0 mod2.Similarly, for n=6, sum=84=14n. 14n≡14n-12n=2n≡0 mod2n. Therefore, sum≡0 mod2n. N(n)=14≡0 mod2.Therefore, in general, for even n, sum= k*n, where k=Σ φ(d) *2^{n/d}/n. But for n=2, sum=3n, which is 3*2=6. Then 3n ≡n mod2n implies 3n -n=2n≡0 mod2n. Therefore, 3n≡n mod2n. For n=2, that&#39;s true. For higher even n, say n=4, sum=6n=24. 6n≡6n mod8=24 mod8=0. 0≡4 mod8? No. So, unless k is congruent to1 mod2, i.e., when sum= (2m+1)n, then sum≡(2m+1)n≡n mod2n. So to have sum≡n mod2n, k must be odd. So, we need sum= k*n, where k is odd.Therefore, N(n)=k must be odd. Therefore, the problem reduces to whether the number of necklaces N(n)=k is odd, which happens exactly when the sum Σ φ(d) *2^{n/d} is ≡n mod2n, i.e., when k≡1 mod2.But how can we characterize n such that Σ φ(d)*2^{n/d} ≡n mod2n.But maybe another approach is needed. Let&#39;s think about the formula for N(n):N(n) = (1/n) Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}We need N(n) odd. So, (1/n) Σ ... must be integer and odd.Therefore, Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡n mod2n.Alternatively, since n divides the sum, which is given, we can write the sum as n*(2k +1) for some integer k. Therefore, Σ_{d|n} φ(d)2^{n/d} = n*(2k +1). Then, Σ ≡n mod2n.But perhaps considering the sum modulo 2. Wait, but we already saw that for even n, the sum is even + even + ... + even, which is even. Wait, no. For even n:sum=2^n +2^{n/2} + sum_{d|n,d≥3} φ(d)2^{n/d}But 2^n is divisible by 4 when n ≥2. 2^{n/2} is divisible by 2. sum_{d|n,d≥3} ... each term is even*even=even. Therefore, sum is divisible by 2. Therefore, sum=2m. Then N(n)=2m/n. Since n is even, n=2n&#39;, so N(n)=2m/(2n&#39;)=m/n&#39;. For N(n) to be integer, n&#39; must divide m. But how does this help?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the case when n is a power of 2. Let n=2^k.Then, the divisors d of n are 1,2,4,...,2^k.Compute sum=Σ_{i=0}^k φ(2^i) *2^{2^k /2^i}.φ(2^i)=2^{i} -2^{i-1}=2^{i-1} for i≥1, and φ(1)=1.So, sum=1*2^{2^k} + Σ_{i=1}^k 2^{i-1}*2^{2^{k}/2^{i}}.Wait, let&#39;s compute for n=2^k:sum =2^{2^k} + Σ_{i=1}^k 2^{i -1} *2^{2^{k -i}}.Let me write it as:sum=2^{2^k} + Σ_{j=0}^{k-1} 2^{k - j -1} *2^{2^{j}}} where j =k -i.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s take specific k.For k=1, n=2:sum=2^{2} + Σ_{i=1}^1 2^{1-1}*2^{2^{1}/2^{1}}}=4 + 1*2^{1}=4 +2=6. Which is correct, gives N(2)=3.For k=2, n=4:sum=2^{4} + Σ_{i=1}^2 2^{i-1}*2^{4/2^i}i=1: 2^{0}*2^{4/2}=1*2^2=4i=2:2^{1}*2^{4/4}=2*2^1=4Total sum=16 +4 +4=24. N(4)=24/4=6.For k=3, n=8:sum=2^8 + Σ_{i=1}^3 2^{i-1}*2^{8/2^i}i=1:2^{0}*2^{8/2}=1*2^4=16i=2:2^{1}*2^{8/4}=2*2^2=8i=3:2^{2}*2^{8/8}=4*2^1=8Total sum=256 +16 +8 +8=288. N(8)=288/8=36.So, for n=2^k, the sum seems to be divisible by n, giving N(n)=sum/n. For k=1, N(n)=3 (odd). For k=2,6 (even). For k=3,36 (even). So, only when k=1, n=2, N(n) is odd. For higher k, N(n) is even.Therefore, perhaps n=2 is the only power of 2 where N(n) is odd.But maybe other even numbers? Let&#39;s suppose n=6 again. Which is 2*3. Let&#39;s see if composite even numbers can yield odd N(n). But from previous examples, n=6 gives N(n)=14 even, n=10 gives 108 even. So no.Alternatively, let&#39;s analyze the formula N(n) = (1/n) Σ φ(d) 2^{n/d} mod2.But N(n) must be integer. So, sum must be divisible by n. Then, sum/n is integer. So, we need sum/n ≡1 mod2. Therefore, sum ≡n mod2n.Alternatively, sum ≡n mod2n. Which implies that sum/n ≡1 mod2. So, sum =n*(2k +1). Therefore, sum ≡n mod2n.To analyze when this holds, let&#39;s consider the sum for even n.For even n, sum=2^n +2^{n/2} + Σ_{d|n, d≥3} φ(d)2^{n/d}We can write sum=2^{n} +2^{n/2} + 2m, where m is an integer. Therefore, sum=2^{n} +2^{n/2} +2m. Then, sum ≡0 +0 +0≡0 mod2. But n is even, so n≡0 mod2. Therefore, sum≡0≡n mod2. Which is necessary but not sufficient.But we need sum≡n mod2n.Let’s consider modulo 4. For even n=2k:If n is even, then sum=2^{2k} +2^{k} + even terms.2^{2k} ≡0 mod4 (since 2k ≥2)2^{k} ≡0 mod4 if k≥2, i.e., n=2k≥4.But if k=1 (n=2), 2^{k}=2^1=2≡2 mod4.Therefore, for n=2:sum=2^2 +2^1 + ...=4 +2=6≡2 mod4. Which is equal to n=2 mod4. So, 6≡2 mod4. Then, 6≡2 mod(2*2=4). Therefore, sum≡n mod2n holds.For n≥4:sum=2^{2k} +2^{k} + ... ≡0 +0 + ...≡0 mod4. But n=2k, and if k≥2, then n=2k≡0 mod4. Therefore, sum≡0≡n mod4 only if n≡0 mod4, which it is. But this is again not helpful.Wait, but we need sum≡n mod2n. For n=2: sum=6≡2 mod4=2n=4. So 6 mod4=2≡2 mod4. So, sum≡n mod2n. For n=4: sum=24≡24 mod8=0≡4 mod8? No. 24 mod8=0, n=4 mod8=4. 0≡4 mod8? No. So, not congruent. Therefore, only n=2 satisfies sum≡n mod2n.Hence, the only solution is n=2.Therefore, the answer is all integers n≥2 that are equal to 2.Final AnswerThe integer ( n ge 2 ) for which ( B_n ) splits into an odd number of equivalence classes is (boxed{2}).&lt;/think&gt;To determine the integers ( n ge 2 ) for which ( B_n ) splits into an odd number of equivalence classes under cyclic permutations, we use Burnside&#39;s lemma. The number of equivalence classes (necklaces) ( N(n) ) is given by:[N(n) = frac{1}{n} sum_{d mid n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d}]where ( phi ) is Euler&#39;s totient function. We need ( N(n) ) to be odd.  Key Steps:1. Burnside&#39;s Lemma Application: The number of necklaces ( N(n) ) is the average number of fixed points under the action of the cyclic group. This involves summing over all divisors ( d ) of ( n ).2. Parity Analysis: For ( N(n) ) to be odd, the sum ( sum_{d mid n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d} ) must be congruent to ( n mod 2n ). This is because ( N(n) = frac{1}{n} sum_{d mid n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d} ) must be an integer and odd.3. Case Analysis:   - Odd ( n ): The sum ( sum_{d mid n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d} ) is even, leading to ( N(n) ) being even.   - Even ( n ): The sum modulo ( 2n ) must be checked. For ( n = 2 ), the sum is 6, which is congruent to ( 2 mod 4 ), making ( N(2) = 3 ) odd. For higher even ( n ), the sum modulo ( 2n ) is 0, leading to even ( N(n) ). Conclusion:Only ( n = 2 ) satisfies the condition where the number of equivalence classes is odd.[boxed{2}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out for which integers n ≥ 2, the set B_n of all binary n-tuples splits into an odd number of equivalence classes when considering equivalence under cyclic permutations. Hmm, this seems related to group actions, maybe Burnside&#39;s lemma? Let me recall.Burnside&#39;s lemma says that the number of orbits (which in this case are the equivalence classes) is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group&#39;s elements. The group here is the cyclic group C_n acting on the set B_n by cyclic permutations. So, to apply Burnside, I need to compute for each rotation (shift by k positions) the number of binary n-tuples fixed by that rotation, then average them over the group.The formula would be: Number of equivalence classes = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} }, where φ is Euler&#39;s totient function. Wait, is that right? Because for cyclic groups, the number of necklaces (which is what these equivalence classes are called) is given by (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} }. So, the question is for which n is this sum odd.So, the problem reduces to determining when (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} is odd. But since we are dealing with integers, we can ignore the division by n for parity considerations. Wait, but actually, we need to check whether that sum is congruent to 1 mod 2, but multiplied by 1/n. Wait, but n is an integer, and we need the total number of equivalence classes to be odd. So, actually, we need that (Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d}) ≡ 1 mod 2n? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.Wait, the number of equivalence classes is an integer, so Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} must be divisible by n. Therefore, when we compute the sum divided by n, we get an integer. We need that integer to be odd. So, the sum Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n. Because if we have (sum)/n ≡ 1 mod 2, then sum ≡ n mod 2n. Since sum is divisible by n, sum = n * k, so k ≡ 1 mod 2. Therefore, sum ≡ n mod 2n.Therefore, we need Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s easier to compute the sum modulo 2n and check when it&#39;s congruent to n modulo 2n, which would imply that sum/n is odd.Alternatively, perhaps compute the sum modulo 2 and see when the sum is congruent to 1 modulo 2, but I think this approach is not correct because dividing by n (which is in the denominator) can change the parity. For example, if n is even, then dividing by n could turn an even sum into an odd number or vice versa. Wait, but n is at least 2. Let me see.Wait, the number of equivalence classes is (sum)/n. We need this to be odd. So, (sum)/n ≡ 1 mod 2. Therefore, sum ≡ n mod 2n. Because sum = n * k, where k is the number of classes. So, if k is odd, sum ≡ n mod 2n. If k is even, sum ≡ 0 mod 2n. Therefore, the condition is sum ≡ n mod 2n.Therefore, the key is to compute Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 2^{n/d} ≡ n mod 2n.But this might be complicated. Let me consider another approach. Since we need the number of necklaces to be odd, and the formula is (1/n) Σ φ(d) 2^{n/d}. Maybe using generating functions or Möbius inversion? Alternatively, considering binary necklaces, the number is given by that formula, and we need it to be odd.Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of parity. Let me compute the sum modulo 2n. But 2n is even, so perhaps look at modulo 2 and modulo n separately and use the Chinese remainder theorem. Since n can be even or odd.But maybe even start with small n and look for a pattern.Let me compute for n=2: The number of necklaces is (φ(1)*2^2 + φ(2)*2^1)/2 = (1*4 + 1*2)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Which is odd. So n=2 works.n=3: (φ(1)*2^3 + φ(3)*2^1)/3 = (8 + 2*2)/3 = (8 + 4)/3 = 12/3 = 4. Even. So n=3 doesn&#39;t work.n=4: (φ(1)*2^4 + φ(2)*2^2 + φ(4)*2^1)/4 = (16 + 1*4 + 2*2)/4 = (16 + 4 + 4)/4 = 24/4 = 6. Even. Doesn&#39;t work.n=5: (φ(1)*2^5 + φ(5)*2^1)/5 = (32 + 4*2)/5 = (32 + 8)/5 = 40/5 = 8. Even.n=6: Divisors 1,2,3,6. So sum is φ(1)*2^6 + φ(2)*2^3 + φ(3)*2^2 + φ(6)*2^1 = 64 + 1*8 + 2*4 + 2*2 = 64 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 84. 84 divided by 6 is 14. Even.n=1: Wait, n ≥2. So n=7: (φ(1)*2^7 + φ(7)*2^1)/7 = (128 + 6*2)/7 = (128 + 12)/7 = 140/7 = 20. Even.n=8: Sum is φ(1)*2^8 + φ(2)*2^4 + φ(4)*2^2 + φ(8)*2^1 = 256 + 1*16 + 2*4 + 4*2 = 256 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 288. 288 /8=36. Even.n=9: φ(1)*2^9 + φ(3)*2^3 + φ(9)*2^1 = 512 + 2*8 + 6*2 = 512 + 16 +12=540. 540/9=60. Even.n=10: divisors 1,2,5,10. Sum=φ(1)*2^10 + φ(2)*2^5 + φ(5)*2^2 + φ(10)*2^1= 1024 +1*32 +4*4 +4*2=1024 +32 +16 +8=1080. 1080/10=108. Even.Hmm, so up to n=10, only n=2 gives an odd number. Let me check n=1: Not allowed. n=2 is the only one so far. Maybe n=2 is the only one? But let&#39;s check n=16.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a pattern here. Let me see for n=2:Number of classes is 3, which is odd. For n=1, which is not allowed, it would be 2, which is even. So n=2 is odd.But maybe when n is a power of 2, the number of necklaces is odd? Wait, n=4: 6, even. n=8:36, even. So no. Then why is n=2 special?Alternatively, perhaps n=2 is the only one where the number of necklaces is odd. Let me check n=6 again. 14, even. n=12? Let&#39;s compute.n=12: divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12.Sum= φ(1)*2^12 + φ(2)*2^6 + φ(3)*2^4 + φ(4)*2^3 + φ(6)*2^2 + φ(12)*2^1.Compute each term:φ(1)=1, 2^12=4096φ(2)=1, 2^6=64φ(3)=2, 2^4=16 → 32φ(4)=2, 2^3=8 →16φ(6)=2, 2^2=4 →8φ(12)=4, 2^1=2 →8Total sum: 4096 +64 +32 +16 +8 +8 = 4096 + 64 is 4160, +32 is 4192, +16 is 4208, +8 is 4216, +8 is 4224.4224 divided by 12 is 352. Even. So nope.Wait, is there any n ≥2 where the number is odd except n=2? Let&#39;s check n=14.n=14: divisors 1,2,7,14.Sum= φ(1)*2^14 + φ(2)*2^7 + φ(7)*2^2 + φ(14)*2^1.φ(1)=1, 2^14=16384φ(2)=1, 2^7=128φ(7)=6, 2^2=4 →24φ(14)=6, 2^1=2 →12Total sum:16384 +128 +24 +12=16384+128=16512, +24=16536, +12=16548. Divide by 14: 16548 /14= 16548 ÷14=1182. So even.Hmm. So seems like n=2 is the only one. Wait, maybe n=1 is also allowed? But the problem says n ≥2. So answer is n=2?But why? Let me think again. Let&#39;s see the formula for n=2: (φ(1)2^2 + φ(2)2^1)/2 = (4 + 2)/2 = 3. For n=2, the number of necklaces is 3, which is odd. For all other n, seems like it&#39;s even. So maybe the answer is n=2. But why?Let me try to think in terms of parity. The total number of necklaces is (1/n) Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}. For this to be odd, the sum Σ φ(d) 2^{n/d} must be congruent to n mod 2n. So, modulo 2, the sum must be congruent to n mod 2. Let&#39;s compute the sum modulo 2.Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡ Σ_{d|n} φ(d) * 0^{n/d} mod 2, since 2 ≡ 0 mod 2. Wait, but 2^{n/d} is 0 mod 2 when n/d ≥1, which it is for all d|n. So unless n/d=0, which it isn&#39;t. So all terms would be 0 mod 2 except when 2^{n/d} is 1 mod 2. But 2^{k} is 0 mod 2 for k ≥1. So the sum is 0 mod 2. Therefore, Σ φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡0 mod 2. But we need this sum ≡n mod 2. So 0 ≡n mod 2, which implies n is even. But n=2 is even, yet the sum is 6, which is 6 ≡0 mod 2, and n=2 is even, so 0 ≡0 mod 2. But in that case, the sum is 6, which divided by n=2 gives 3, which is odd. Wait, so even though the sum is even, when divided by n (which is also even), we can get an odd number. So my previous reasoning was flawed.Wait, so let&#39;s approach this again. Let’s denote the number of necklaces as N(n) = (1/n) Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}. We need N(n) to be odd. So, N(n) ≡1 mod 2. Which implies that Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡n mod 2n. But maybe it&#39;s easier to consider modulo 2.Since N(n) is an integer, let&#39;s write:Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡n mod 2n.But if we take modulo 2 on both sides:Left side: Σ φ(d) 2^{n/d} ≡ Σ φ(d)*0 ≡0 mod 2, since 2^{n/d} is even.Right side: n ≡0 or 1 mod 2. So 0 ≡n mod 2. Therefore, n must be even. Therefore, N(n) can only be odd if n is even. But n=2 is even and N(2)=3 is odd, but n=4 is even and N(4)=6 is even. So being even is necessary but not sufficient.Thus, we need a more refined approach.Let me consider the sum modulo 4. Let&#39;s suppose n is even. Let’s write n=2^k * m, where m is odd. Maybe the structure depends on k.But perhaps it&#39;s better to compute the sum modulo 2n. Let me try to compute Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} modulo 2n.Alternatively, note that for n ≥2, except for n=2, when n is even, the number of necklaces N(n) is even. Let me test n=6 again. N(6)=14, which is even. n=8:36, even. n=10:108, even. So perhaps only n=2.But why? Let&#39;s see. For n=2, the sum is φ(1)*2^2 + φ(2)*2^1=4 +2=6. 6 divided by 2 is 3. For n=4: sum is 16 +4 +4=24. 24/4=6. For n=6: sum is 64 +8 +8 +4=84. 84/6=14. So the sum is divisible by n, but the quotient is odd only when sum/n is odd.So when is sum/n odd? For n=2, sum=6, 6/2=3 odd. For n=4, sum=24, 24/4=6 even. For n=6, 84/6=14 even. For n=8, sum=288, 288/8=36 even. So why is n=2 special?Looking at the sum:Σ_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d} = n * N(n). So we have n * N(n) ≡n mod 2n, which implies N(n) ≡1 mod 2. Therefore, n * N(n) ≡n mod 2n ⇒ n(N(n) -1) ≡0 mod 2n ⇒ (N(n) -1) ≡0 mod 2. Which is equivalent to N(n) ≡1 mod 2. So this brings us back.Alternatively, if we consider n=2: sum=6=2*3, which is 2*odd. For other n=even, sum= n*even. For example, n=4: sum=24=4*6, 6 even. n=6:84=6*14, 14 even. So, why is the sum for n=2 equal to 2*odd, but for others, 2*even?Looking at the sum:For n=2: φ(1)2^2 + φ(2)2^1 =1*4 +1*2=6=2*3.For n=4: φ(1)2^4 +φ(2)2^2 +φ(4)2^1=16+4+4=24=4*6.For n=6:φ(1)2^6 +φ(2)2^3 +φ(3)2^2 +φ(6)2^1=64+8+8+4=84=6*14.So, in each case, except n=2, the sum is n times even. For n=2, it&#39;s n times odd. So why is the sum for n=2 divisible by n=2 and the quotient is odd, while for other n, the quotient is even?Looking into the terms of the sum for general even n:Note that when n is even, n has divisors d=1,2,...,n. Let&#39;s split the sum into terms where d is odd and d is even.Wait, but for even n, divisors can be both even and odd. For example, n=6 has d=1,2,3,6. So odd divisors 1,3 and even divisors 2,6.So, for even n, write the sum as Σ_{d|n, d odd} φ(d)2^{n/d} + Σ_{d|n, d even} φ(d)2^{n/d}.For the odd divisors d, φ(d) is even if d has any prime factors other than 2 (since φ(d) for d odd and greater than 1 is even). Wait, φ(d) is multiplicative, and for prime p, φ(p)=p-1, which is even if p is odd. So, for d odd and d≥3, φ(d) is even. For d=1, φ(1)=1. So, in the sum over odd divisors, only d=1 contributes an odd term, others contribute even terms.Similarly, for even divisors d, φ(d) is even when d is even and d≥2. Because if d is even, say d=2^k *m, m odd, then φ(d)=φ(2^k)*φ(m)=2^{k-1}*φ(m). If k≥1, then 2^{k-1} is at least 1, so φ(d) is even unless k=1 and m=1 (i.e., d=2). For d=2, φ(2)=1. So, in the sum over even divisors, only d=2 contributes φ(d)=1, others contribute even terms.Therefore, breaking down the total sum for even n:Sum = [φ(1)2^{n/1} + Σ_{d|n, d odd, d≥3} φ(d)2^{n/d}] + [φ(2)2^{n/2} + Σ_{d|n, d even, d≥4} φ(d)2^{n/d}]= [2^n + Σ_{d odd, d≥3} even * 2^{n/d}] + [2^{n/2} + Σ_{d even, d≥4} even * 2^{n/d}]Thus, modulo 2:Sum ≡ 2^n + 0 + 2^{n/2} + 0 ≡ (2^n + 2^{n/2}) mod 2.But 2^n is congruent to 0 mod 2 for n≥1, and 2^{n/2} is congruent to 0 mod 2 if n/2 ≥1, i.e., n≥2. Therefore, Sum ≡0 +0≡0 mod 2. So the entire sum is even, as we saw earlier.But we need to go further and find when Sum/n is odd. Since Sum is even and n is even (as we concluded necessary), Sum/n = (even)/(even). It could be odd or even. For example, 6/2=3 (odd), 24/4=6 (even), 84/6=14 (even), etc.So, to determine when Sum/n is odd, let&#39;s write Sum =n *k, where k is the number of necklaces. We need k odd. So Sum =n *k, and Sum is even. Since n is even, n=2*m, so Sum=2*m*k. Since Sum is even, m*k can be any integer. But we need k odd. So, m must be such that 2*m*k is Sum, and k is odd.But how to relate this back to the terms of the sum. Maybe consider the highest power of 2 dividing n. Let’s suppose n=2^k, where k≥1. Let&#39;s check n=2,4,8, etc.For n=2=2^1:Sum=6=2*3. So k=3, which is odd. For n=4=2^2:Sum=24=4*6. k=6, even. For n=8=2^3:Sum=288=8*36. k=36, even. So, when n is a power of 2 greater than 2, k is even. So n=2 is the only power of 2 where k is odd.What if n is even but not a power of 2? For example, n=6=2*3:Sum=84=6*14. k=14, even. n=10=2*5: Sum=1080=10*108. k=108, even. n=12=4224=12*352. k=352, even. So, seems like for even n≠2, k is even.Therefore, the only n≥2 where the number of necklaces is odd is n=2.Therefore, the answer is boxed{2}.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the integers ( n ge 2 ) for which ( B_n ) splits into an odd number of equivalence classes under cyclic permutations, we use Burnside&#39;s lemma. The number of equivalence classes (necklaces) is given by:[frac{1}{n} sum_{d|n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d}]where ( phi ) is Euler&#39;s totient function. We need this number to be odd. Key steps:1. Burnside&#39;s Lemma: The number of necklaces is the average number of fixed points of the group action, leading to the formula above.2. Parity Analysis: The sum ( sum_{d|n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d} ) must be congruent to ( n mod 2n ) for the quotient (number of necklaces) to be odd.3. Modulo Considerations: For even ( n ), the sum modulo 2 is 0, implying ( n ) must be even. Further analysis shows that for ( n = 2 ), the sum is 6, leading to 3 necklaces (odd). For other even ( n ), the sum divided by ( n ) results in an even number.Detailed analysis:- For ( n = 2 ), the number of necklaces is 3 (odd).- For other even ( n ), the sum ( sum_{d|n} phi(d) cdot 2^{n/d} ) results in an even quotient when divided by ( n ).Thus, the only integer ( n ge 2 ) for which ( B_n ) splits into an odd number of equivalence classes is ( n = 2 ).[boxed{2}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-a10afc05></div><p class="review-content" data-v-a10afc05><span class="icon" data-v-a10afc05>🔑:</span>1. Define the problem and notation:   For every integer ( n ge 2 ), let ( B_n ) denote the set of all binary ( n )-tuples of zeroes and ones. We split ( B_n ) into equivalence classes by letting two ( n )-tuples be equivalent if one is obtained from the other by a cyclic permutation. We need to determine the integers ( n ge 2 ) for which ( B_n ) splits into an odd number of equivalence classes.2. Apply Burnside&#39;s Lemma:   By Burnside&#39;s Lemma, the number of orbits (equivalence classes) of ( B_n ) under the action of cyclic permutations is given by:   [   frac{1}{n} sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^{gcd(i, n)}   ]   This can be rewritten using the properties of the Euler&#39;s totient function ( varphi ):   [   frac{1}{n} sum_{d mid n} varphileft(frac{n}{d}right) 2^d   ]   Let ( S = sum_{d mid n} varphileft(frac{n}{d}right) 2^d ). Then the number of orbits is ( frac{S}{n} ).3. Analyze the valuation of ( S ):   We need to determine when ( frac{S}{n} ) is an odd number. This requires ( S ) to be divisible by ( n ) but not by ( 2n ). We claim that:   [   v_2(S) geq v_2(varphi(n)) + 1   ]   where ( v_2(x) ) denotes the 2-adic valuation of ( x ), i.e., the highest power of 2 dividing ( x ).4. Prove the claim:   It suffices to check that:   [   v_2left(varphileft(frac{n}{d}right)right) + d geq v_2(varphi(n)) + 1   ]   for all ( d &gt; 1 ). This is because ( d ) should increase more than ( v_2left(varphileft(frac{n}{d}right)right) ) decreases. Consider the bound:   [   v_2left(varphileft(frac{n}{d}right)right) + v_2(varphi(d)) = v_2left(varphileft(frac{n}{d}right) varphi(d)right) geq v_2(varphi(n)) - 1   ]   This follows by observing individual prime powers dividing ( frac{n}{d} ) and ( d ). Then we have:   [   v_2left(varphileft(frac{n}{d}right)right) + d geq v_2(varphi(n)) + 1 + d - v_2(varphi(d)) - 2 geq v_2(varphi(n)) + 1   ]   because ( d - v_2(varphi(d)) - 2 = 0 ) for ( d = 2, 3 ) and ( d geq log_2(d) + 2 geq v_2(varphi(d)) + 2 ) for ( d geq 4 ).5. Implication of the claim:   This claim implies:   [   v_2(S) geq v_2(varphi(n)) + 1 geq v_2(n)   ]   This is because ( varphi ) can only knock off one 2 from ( n ), but every odd prime dividing ( n ) contributes to ( v_2(varphi(n)) ). In particular, if the inequality is strict, then the number of orbits ( frac{S}{n} ) is even. Thus, we must have equality in both inequalities, i.e., ( n ) is a power of 2 and ( n in {2, 3, 4} ).6.
