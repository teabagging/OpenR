Let me take them one by one and analyze each. Let&#39;s start with option A.Option A: The negation of &quot;If x ≠ a and x ≠ b, then x² - (a + b)x + ab ≠ 0&quot; is &quot;If x = a and x = b, then x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0&quot;. Hmm, negation of a conditional statement. The original statement is of the form: If P, then Q. Where P is &quot;x ≠ a and x ≠ b&quot; and Q is &quot;x² - (a + b)x + ab ≠ 0&quot;. The negation of &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;P and not Q&quot;. So, the negation should be &quot;x ≠ a and x ≠ b, and x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0&quot;. But the answer given here is &quot;If x = a and x = b, then x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0&quot;. Wait, that seems different. The negation isn&#39;t another conditional statement; it&#39;s a conjunction. So the negation is not another &quot;if-then&quot; statement. Therefore, the negation provided in option A is incorrect. So A is wrong.Option B: The converse of &quot;x = -1 is a root of x² - 5x - 6 = 0&quot; is a true proposition. First, let&#39;s parse the original statement. The original statement is &quot;x = -1 is a root of the equation x² - 5x - 6 = 0&quot;. To check if this is true, substitute x = -1 into the equation: (-1)² -5*(-1) -6 = 1 +5 -6 = 0. So, x = -1 is indeed a root. But the problem is about the converse. Wait, the original statement is phrased a bit oddly. Let me see. The original statement is of the form: If x = -1, then it is a root of the equation. But in logical terms, when we talk about converse, we need to be clear about the direction. The statement &quot;x = -1 is a root of...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;If x = -1, then x satisfies the equation&quot;. The converse would be &quot;If x satisfies the equation, then x = -1&quot;. But since the equation is quadratic, it can have two roots. Let&#39;s check the equation: x² -5x -6 =0. Let&#39;s factor it: (x - 6)(x + 1) = 0. So the roots are x =6 and x=-1. Therefore, the converse would be &quot;If x is a root of the equation, then x = -1&quot;. But since there is another root, x=6, the converse is false. Therefore, the converse is not a true proposition. Therefore, option B is incorrect.Wait, but maybe the original statement is phrased differently. Wait, maybe the original statement is &quot;x = -1 is a root of the equation&quot;, which is a simple proposition, not an implication. Then, the converse in logic usually applies to implications. If the original is just a proposition, not an implication, then how does the converse work? Maybe I need to re-examine this.Alternatively, perhaps the original statement is considered as &quot;If x is a root of x² -5x -6 =0, then x = -1&quot;. Then, the converse would be &quot;If x = -1, then x is a root of the equation&quot;. But in that case, the original statement is actually false because the equation has two roots, so the original implication would be false. But the original statement is presented as a proposition, so maybe the user is confused here.Wait, maybe the problem is misphrased. Let&#39;s check again. The problem says: &quot;The converse of &#39;x = -1&#39; is a root of &#39;x² -5x -6 =0&#39; is a true proposition.&quot; Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse the sentence structure. So, the original proposition is: &quot;&#39;x = -1&#39; is a root of &#39;x² -5x -6 =0&#39;&quot;. The converse of this. But in logic, the converse is typically for implications. If the original is a simple proposition, not an implication, then the concept of converse doesn&#39;t apply. So maybe this is a trick question. However, perhaps the original is phrased as an implication. For example, maybe the original is: &quot;If x = -1, then x is a root of the equation.&quot; Then the converse would be &quot;If x is a root of the equation, then x = -1.&quot; Since the equation has roots at x =6 and x=-1, the converse is false. Therefore, the converse is not a true proposition. Therefore, option B is incorrect.Alternatively, if the original statement is &quot;x = -1 is a root&quot;, which is equivalent to an implication: &quot;If x = -1, then the equation holds.&quot; But in that case, the converse would be &quot;If the equation holds, then x = -1&quot;, which is false. So either way, the converse is false. Therefore, B is incorrect.Option C: The negation of the proposition &quot;There exists an x ∈ ℝ, such that x² + x +1 &lt;0&quot; is &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² + x +1 &lt;0&quot;.Okay, the original statement is an existential quantifier: ∃x∈ℝ, P(x), where P(x) is x² +x +1 &lt;0. The negation of this is ∀x∈ℝ, ¬P(x), which is ∀x∈ℝ, x² +x +1 ≥0. Therefore, the negation should be &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² +x +1 is not less than 0&quot;, i.e., &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² +x +1 ≥0&quot;. But the answer given here is &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² +x +1 &lt;0&quot;, which is different. So the negation is not changing the inequality, it&#39;s changing the quantifier and negating the inequality. Therefore, option C is incorrect because the negation should have ≥0 instead of &lt;0. So C is wrong.Option D: The contrapositive of the proposition &quot;If x = y, then sinx = siny&quot; is a true proposition.First, let&#39;s recall that the contrapositive of &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is &quot;If ¬Q, then ¬P&quot;, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.Original statement: If x = y, then sinx = siny. This is definitely true, because if two variables are equal, then their sine values must be equal.Contrapositive: If sinx ≠ siny, then x ≠ y. Which is also true, because if the sines are not equal, the variables cannot be equal. Since contrapositive is logically equivalent, and the original is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, D is correct.Wait, but let me check if there are any nuances. For example, sine is periodic and not injective over all real numbers. So, for example, sin(0) = sin(π) = 0, but 0 ≠ π. So, even if sinx = siny, x may not equal y. However, in the contrapositive, the statement is &quot;If sinx ≠ siny, then x ≠ y&quot;, which is still true. Because contrapositive is equivalent. The original statement is &quot;If x = y, then sinx = siny&quot; which is a tautology, as equality is preserved under function application. Therefore, the contrapositive must hold. Even though the converse (&quot;If sinx = siny, then x = y&quot;) is not true, the contrapositive is different. The contrapositive is indeed true because if the outputs are different, the inputs must have been different. So yes, D is correct.So, among the options, only D is correct.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Option A: The negation of &quot;If ( x neq a ) and ( x neq b ), then ( x^2 - (a+b)x + ab neq 0 )&quot; is &quot;If ( x = a ) and ( x = b ), then ( x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = 0 )&quot;. The negation of a conditional statement &quot;If ( P ), then ( Q )&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;( P ) and not ( Q )&quot;. The correct negation should be &quot;( x neq a ) and ( x neq b ), and ( x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = 0 )&quot;. The given negation is incorrect because it is another conditional statement. Therefore, A is wrong.Option B: The converse of &quot;( x = -1 )&quot; is a root of &quot;( x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 )&quot; is a true proposition. The original statement is true since substituting ( x = -1 ) into the equation results in 0. The converse would be &quot;If ( x ) is a root of the equation, then ( x = -1 )&quot;. However, the equation has another root ( x = 6 ), making the converse false. Therefore, B is incorrect.Option C: The negation of the proposition &quot;There exists an ( x in mathbb{R} ), such that ( x^2 + x + 1 &lt; 0 )&quot; is &quot;For all ( x in mathbb{R} ), ( x^2 + x + 1 &lt; 0 )&quot;. The negation of an existential quantifier is a universal quantifier with the negated statement. The correct negation should be &quot;For all ( x in mathbb{R} ), ( x^2 + x + 1 geq 0 )&quot;. The given negation incorrectly keeps the inequality. Therefore, C is wrong.Option D: The contrapositive of the proposition &quot;If ( x = y ), then ( sin x = sin y )&quot; is a true proposition. The contrapositive of &quot;If ( P ), then ( Q )&quot; is &quot;If ( neg Q ), then ( neg P )&quot;. The original statement is true, and its contrapositive &quot;If ( sin x neq sin y ), then ( x neq y )&quot; is also true. Therefore, D is correct.boxed{D},&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question here about propositions and their logical properties. Let me try to break down each option step by step. Let&#39;s start by understanding what each statement is claiming.First, the question asks which of the statements (A, B, C, D) is correct regarding propositions. Each option deals with different logical concepts: negation, converse, contrapositive, and their truth values.Starting with Option A: The negation of &quot;If x ≠ a and x ≠ b, then x² - (a+b)x + ab ≠ 0&quot; is &quot;If x = a and x = b, then x² - (a+b)x + ab = 0&quot;.Okay, so the original statement is a conditional: If P, then Q, where P is &quot;x ≠ a and x ≠ b&quot; and Q is &quot;x² - (a+b)x + ab ≠ 0&quot;. The negation of a conditional statement &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;P and not Q&quot;. So, the negation should be that the antecedent (P) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false. Therefore, the correct negation should be: &quot;x ≠ a and x ≠ b, and x² - (a+b)x + ab = 0&quot;. However, Option A says the negation is &quot;If x = a and x = b, then x² - (a+b)x + ab = 0&quot;. Wait, that&#39;s not the same. The original negation is about maintaining the hypothesis but negating the conclusion, but here they changed the hypothesis to x = a and x = b. That seems incorrect. Because when you negate &quot;If P, then Q&quot;, you don&#39;t negate P; you keep P and negate Q. So the negation should be &quot;P and not Q&quot;, not &quot;If not P, then not Q&quot;. Therefore, Option A is incorrect because the negation is misrepresented as another conditional statement instead of a conjunction.Moving on to Option B: The converse of &quot;x = -1 is a root of x² - 5x - 6 = 0&quot; is a true proposition.First, let&#39;s recall that the original statement is &quot;x = -1 is a root of the equation x² - 5x - 6 = 0&quot;. To check if this is true, we can substitute x = -1 into the equation:(-1)² - 5*(-1) - 6 = 1 + 5 - 6 = 0. So, yes, x = -1 is a root. Wait, but actually, the original statement is asserting that &quot;x = -1 is a root&quot;, which is true. Now, the converse... Hmm, wait. Wait, the converse in logic typically refers to swapping the hypothesis and conclusion in a conditional statement. But here, the statement isn&#39;t phrased as a conditional. It&#39;s a simple statement: &quot;x = -1 is a root of the equation&quot;. So maybe they are misapplying the term converse here? Because converse usually applies to implications.Wait, perhaps the original problem was intended as a conditional. Let me check again. The problem says: &quot;The converse of &#39;x = -1&#39; is a root of &#39;x² - 5x - 6 = 0&#39; is a true proposition.&quot; Hmm, maybe there was a misphrasing here. Let me parse this.Wait, the original statement is: &quot;x = -1 is a root of x² - 5x -6 = 0&quot;. So, in logical terms, this is like a proposition P: &quot;If x = -1, then x² -5x -6 = 0&quot;. Then the converse would be: &quot;If x² -5x -6 = 0, then x = -1&quot;. But in reality, the equation x² -5x -6 =0 factors as (x - 6)(x +1) =0, so roots are x=6 and x=-1. Therefore, the converse statement &quot;If x is a root of the equation, then x = -1&quot; is false because x could also be 6. But wait, the original statement is &quot;x = -1 is a root&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;If x = -1, then it is a root&quot;. The converse would be &quot;If it is a root, then x = -1&quot;. Since there is another root, the converse is false. Therefore, the converse is not a true proposition. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.But wait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Let me check again. The original statement is: &quot;x = -1 is a root of x² -5x -6 =0&quot;, which is a simple proposition, not a conditional. So, maybe the converse is not applicable here? Because converse applies to implications. Hmm, maybe the question is ill-posed? But if we take it as an implication, then as I analyzed, the converse is false. So Option B is incorrect.Moving on to Option C: The negation of the proposition &quot;There exists an x ∈ ℝ, such that x² + x + 1 &lt; 0&quot; is &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² + x +1 &lt; 0&quot;.The original proposition is an existential quantifier: ∃x∈ℝ, P(x), where P(x) is &quot;x² +x +1 &lt;0&quot;. The negation of this is a universal statement: ∀x∈ℝ, ¬P(x), which would be &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² +x +1 ≥0&quot;. Therefore, the negation should state that for all real x, x² +x +1 is not less than zero. However, Option C claims the negation is &quot;For all x ∈ ℝ, x² +x +1 &lt;0&quot;, which is incorrect because it&#39;s changing the inequality direction. Instead of negating the inequality (making it ≥0), they kept the same inequality but made it universal. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.Now, Option D: The contrapositive of the proposition &quot;If x = y, then sin x = sin y&quot; is a true proposition.First, let&#39;s recall that the contrapositive of &quot;If P, then Q&quot; is &quot;If not Q, then not P&quot;, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement is &quot;If x = y, then sin x = sin y&quot;. This is a true statement because if two variables are equal, their sine values must be equal. The contrapositive would be &quot;If sin x ≠ sin y, then x ≠ y&quot;. Which is also true, because if the sines are different, then the angles must be different. However, wait, is that necessarily true? Wait, sine is not injective over all real numbers. For example, sin(0) = sin(π) = 0, but 0 ≠ π. Therefore, even if sin x = sin y, x and y might not be equal. However, the contrapositive is &quot;If sin x ≠ sin y, then x ≠ y&quot;, which is indeed true. Because if sin x ≠ sin y, then x cannot be equal to y, because if they were equal, their sines would be equal. So the contrapositive is true. So the contrapositive is a true proposition, so Option D is correct.Wait, let me double-check. Suppose sin x ≠ sin y. Does that necessarily mean x ≠ y? Yes. Because if x were equal to y, then sin x would equal sin y. Therefore, contrapositive holds. The fact that the converse (if sin x = sin y, then x = y) is not true doesn&#39;t affect the contrapositive. The contrapositive is logically equivalent, so since the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, Option D is correct.So summarizing:- A: Incorrect, because negation of &quot;If P then Q&quot; is &quot;P and not Q&quot;, not another implication.- B: Incorrect, the converse is false because there&#39;s another root.- C: Incorrect, negation should be &quot;for all x, x² +x +1 ≥0&quot;.- D: Correct, the contrapositive is true.Therefore, the correct answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which statement about propositions is correct, we analyze each option:Option A: The negation of &quot;If ( x neq a ) and ( x neq b ), then ( x^2 - (a+b)x + ab neq 0 )&quot; is &quot;If ( x = a ) and ( x = b ), then ( x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = 0 )&quot;.  - The negation of a conditional statement &quot;If ( P ), then ( Q )&quot; is ( P ) and not ( Q ).

Here, the contrapositive is &quot;If ( sin x neq sin y ), then ( x neq y )&quot;, which is true because different sines imply different angles.  - CorrectThe correct answer is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5286df18></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5286df18><span class="icon" data-v-5286df18>🔑:</span>The negation of the proposition &quot;If x neq a and x neq b, then x^2 - (a+b)x + ab neq 0&quot; is: If x = a or x = b, then x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = 0, hence option A is incorrect;  The converse of &quot;x = -1 is a root of x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0&quot; is: The root of x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 is x = -1, which is a false proposition, hence option B is incorrect;  The proposition &quot;There exists an x in mathbb{R} such that x^2 + x + 1 &lt; 0&quot; is a particular proposition, its negation is: For all x in mathbb{R}, x^2 + x + 1 geq 0, hence option C is incorrect;  The contrapositive of the proposition &quot;If x = y, then sin x = sin y&quot; is &quot;If sin x neq sin y, then x neq y&quot;, which is correct;  Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{text{D}}.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. I remember that the derivative of arctangent of something is 1 over (1 plus that something squared), right? But wait, then I also have to use the chain rule because it&#39;s not just arctangent of x, it&#39;s arctangent of x squared. So the chain rule says I need to take the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, then multiply by the derivative of the inner function. Let me write this down step by step.First, let me recall the derivative of arctangent. If I have y = arctan(u), then dy/dx is 1/(1 + u²) times du/dx. Yeah, that&#39;s the chain rule application here. So in this problem, u is x squared. So applying that, the derivative dy/dx should be 1 over (1 + (x²)²) multiplied by the derivative of x squared. Wait, let me check that again. The outer function is arctan(u), whose derivative is 1/(1 + u²), and the inner function is u = x². So the derivative of arctan(x²) is [1/(1 + (x²)²)] times the derivative of x². The derivative of x² is 2x. So putting that together, the derivative should be 2x divided by (1 + x⁴). Let me verify that.Wait, (x²)² is x⁴, so 1 + x⁴ is the denominator, and then the numerator is 2x. So yes, that seems right. Let me double-check my steps. Starting with y = arctan(x²). Let u = x², so y = arctan(u). Then dy/du = 1/(1 + u²) and du/dx = 2x. Therefore, dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx = [1/(1 + u²)] * 2x. Substituting back u = x², that becomes [1/(1 + (x²)²)] * 2x = 2x / (1 + x⁴). Hmm, that seems straightforward. I don&#39;t think I made any mistakes here. Let me see if there&#39;s another way to approach this. Maybe using implicit differentiation? Let&#39;s try that just to confirm.If y = arctan(x²), then taking tangent of both sides gives tan(y) = x². Now, differentiate both sides with respect to x. The left side is sec²(y) * dy/dx, and the right side is 2x. Therefore, dy/dx = 2x / sec²(y). But sec²(y) is 1 + tan²(y), and since tan(y) = x², then sec²(y) = 1 + x⁴. Therefore, dy/dx = 2x / (1 + x⁴). Okay, that&#39;s the same result as before. So both methods give me 2x over (1 + x⁴). That gives me more confidence that it&#39;s correct. I think that&#39;s the right derivative. Let me check if there&#39;s another possible error. Maybe in handling the chain rule? For example, sometimes people might forget to square the inner function when plugging into the denominator. But in this case, since u is x², u squared is (x²)² = x⁴, which I included. So that&#39;s correct. Alternatively, if I had a different function inside arctan, like x instead of x², then the derivative would be 1/(1 + x²), which is different. But here, since it&#39;s x², the chain rule adds the 2x factor. So yeah, I think I did that properly. Another way to think about it: the general formula for the derivative of arctan(f(x)) is f&#39;(x) / (1 + (f(x))²). So here, f(x) is x², so f&#39;(x) is 2x, and (f(x))² is x⁴. So substituting into the formula gives 2x / (1 + x⁴). Exactly as before. I guess that&#39;s pretty much all the ways I can think of to verify this. Both the direct chain rule application, implicit differentiation, and the general formula for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions lead to the same answer. So unless I made the same mistake in all three methods, which is possible but unlikely, this should be correct. Therefore, the derivative y&#39; is 2x divided by (1 + x to the fourth power). So in boxed form, it&#39;s boxed{dfrac{2x}{1 + x^4}}.Final AnswerThe derivative of ( y = operatorname{arctg} x^{2} ) is boxed{dfrac{2x}{1 + x^4}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the derivative of ( y = operatorname{arctg} x^{2} ), we use the chain rule. 1. Let ( u = x^2 ). Then ( y = operatorname{arctg}(u) ).2. The derivative of ( operatorname{arctg}(u) ) with respect to ( u ) is ( frac{1}{1 + u^2} ).3. The derivative of ( u = x^2 ) with respect to ( x ) is ( 2x ).Applying the chain rule:[frac{dy}{dx} = frac{dy}{du} cdot frac{du}{dx} = frac{1}{1 + u^2} cdot 2x]Substituting ( u = x^2 ) back into the expression:[frac{dy}{dx} = frac{1}{1 + (x^2)^2} cdot 2x = frac{2x}{1 + x^4}]Thus, the derivative of ( y = operatorname{arctg} x^{2} ) is boxed{dfrac{2x}{1 + x^4}}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x, where y is the arctangent of x squared. Let me write that down: y = arctg(x²). Hmm, arctg is another way of writing arctan, right? So, it&#39;s the inverse tangent function. Alright, so I remember that the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to u is 1/(1 + u²). But since this is a composite function, I&#39;ll need to use the chain rule here. Let me recall the chain rule. If I have a function y = f(g(x)), then the derivative y&#39; is f&#39;(g(x)) multiplied by g&#39;(x). So in this case, f(u) is arctan(u) and g(x) is x². Therefore, the derivative of y with respect to x should be the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to u, evaluated at u = x², multiplied by the derivative of x² with respect to x. Let me compute each part step by step. First, the derivative of arctan(u) with respect to u. As I mentioned earlier, that&#39;s 1/(1 + u²). So substituting u = x² into that gives 1/(1 + (x²)²). Then, the derivative of g(x) = x² is straightforward, that&#39;s 2x. So putting it all together, the derivative y&#39; should be [1/(1 + (x²)²)] * 2x. Let me write that out: y&#39; = (2x)/(1 + x⁴). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Another way to think about it: if y = arctan(x²), then tan(y) = x². Maybe I can use implicit differentiation here. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to x, the left side is sec²(y) * y&#39;, and the right side is 2x. Therefore, y&#39; = 2x / sec²(y). But since tan(y) = x², we can use the identity that sec²(y) = 1 + tan²(y) = 1 + (x²)² = 1 + x⁴. Therefore, y&#39; = 2x / (1 + x⁴), which matches what I got before. That’s reassuring. So both methods give the same result, so I think that&#39;s correct. Let me also check if there are any alternative notations or possible mistakes. For instance, sometimes people might forget to apply the chain rule correctly, especially with the square on x. But in this case, since we have x squared inside the arctan, the chain rule requires us to take the derivative of the outer function (arctan) first, which gives 1/(1 + (x²)²), and then multiply by the derivative of the inner function x², which is 2x. Multiplying those together gives 2x over (1 + x⁴), which seems right. Is there any other way to verify this? Maybe plug in a value. Let&#39;s take x = 1. Then y = arctan(1²) = arctan(1) = π/4. The derivative at x = 1 should be (2*1)/(1 + 1⁴) = 2/2 = 1. Let me check that with a small increment. Let’s compute y at x = 1.1 and x = 0.9, approximate the derivative. Compute y(1.1) = arctan(1.1²) = arctan(1.21). Using a calculator, arctan(1.21) ≈ 0.8795 radians. Similarly, y(0.9) = arctan(0.81) ≈ 0.6778 radians. The difference in y is approximately 0.8795 - 0.6778 = 0.2017. The difference in x is 1.1 - 0.9 = 0.2. So the approximate derivative is 0.2017 / 0.2 ≈ 1.0085, which is close to 1. That’s a good sign. Alternatively, using x = 0. The derivative there would be (2*0)/(1 + 0) = 0. Let&#39;s check y(0.1) = arctan(0.01) ≈ 0.0099996667 and y(-0.1) = arctan(0.01) ≈ 0.0099996667. The slope between these two points would be (0.0099996667 - 0.0099996667)/0.2 = 0, which matches the derivative at x = 0. Another test: x = √1. So x² = 1, same as before. Wait, that&#39;s the same as x = 1. Hmm. Maybe try x = √(sqrt(3)), but that might complicate. Let me pick x = 2. The derivative would be (2*2)/(1 + 16) = 4/17 ≈ 0.2353. Let me compute y(2.01) and y(1.99). y(2.01) = arctan((2.01)^2) = arctan(4.0401). Using a calculator, arctan(4.0401) ≈ 1.328 radians.y(1.99) = arctan((1.99)^2) = arctan(3.9601) ≈ 1.320 radians.Difference in y: 1.328 - 1.320 = 0.008 radians.Difference in x: 2.01 - 1.99 = 0.02.Approximate derivative: 0.008 / 0.02 = 0.4, but wait, that&#39;s not matching 4/17 ≈ 0.2353. Hmm, that&#39;s a problem. Wait, maybe my calculator is not precise enough? Let me check the exact values.Wait, arctan(4.0401) and arctan(3.9601). Let me calculate these with more precision. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.Wait, 4.0401 is close to 4, and arctan(4) is approximately 1.3258 radians. Similarly, 3.9601 is close to 4, but slightly less. arctan(3.96) is a bit less than arctan(4). Let me use linear approximation.Let me consider f(x) = arctan(x). The derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1 + x²). So at x = 4, the derivative is 1/(1 + 16) = 1/17 ≈ 0.0588. So, f(4.0401) ≈ f(4) + 0.0401*(1/17) ≈ 1.3258 + 0.0401/17 ≈ 1.3258 + 0.00236 ≈ 1.32816 radians.Similarly, f(3.9601) ≈ f(4) - 0.0399*(1/17) ≈ 1.3258 - 0.0399/17 ≈ 1.3258 - 0.00235 ≈ 1.32345 radians.Then, the difference in y is approximately 1.32816 - 1.32345 ≈ 0.00471 radians.Difference in x is 0.02, so approximate derivative is 0.00471 / 0.02 ≈ 0.2355, which is very close to 4/17 ≈ 0.2353. Okay, that checks out. So my initial calculation was correct, and the discrepancy was because my rough estimates of arctan(4.04) and arctan(3.96) were not precise enough. Therefore, the derivative y&#39; = 2x / (1 + x⁴) seems correct. Wait, let me just confirm once again the steps. Start with y = arctan(x²). The derivative of arctan(u) is 1/(1 + u²) times du/dx. Here, u = x², so du/dx = 2x. Therefore, multiplying gives 2x / (1 + (x²)²) = 2x / (1 + x⁴). Yep, that&#39;s the same result. I think that&#39;s solid. I don&#39;t see any mistakes in the reasoning. Both the chain rule approach and the implicit differentiation method lead to the same answer, and the numerical checks support it. So I think that&#39;s the correct derivative.Final AnswerThe derivative ( y&#39; ) is boxed{dfrac{2x}{1 + x^4}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the derivative ( y&#39; ) of ( y = operatorname{arctg}(x^2) ), we use the chain rule. 1. The derivative of ( operatorname{arctan}(u) ) with respect to ( u ) is ( frac{1}{1 + u^2} ).2. Here, ( u = x^2 ), so we substitute ( u ) into the derivative: ( frac{1}{1 + (x^2)^2} = frac{1}{1 + x^4} ).3. Next, we find the derivative of the inner function ( x^2 ), which is ( 2x ).4. Applying the chain rule, we multiply these results:    [   y&#39; = left( frac{1}{1 + x^4} right) cdot 2x = frac{2x}{1 + x^4}   ]Verification using implicit differentiation confirms the result. Let ( y = operatorname{arctan}(x^2) ). Then ( tan(y) = x^2 ). Differentiating both sides with respect to ( x ):1. The left side: ( sec^2(y) cdot y&#39; ).2. The right side: ( 2x ).3. Solving for ( y&#39; ): ( y&#39; = frac{2x}{sec^2(y)} ).4. Using the identity ( sec^2(y) = 1 + tan^2(y) = 1 + x^4 ), we get:   [   y&#39; = frac{2x}{1 + x^4}   ]Both methods confirm that the derivative is ( frac{2x}{1 + x^4} ).

I need to find the integer closest to the larger root of this equation involving arctangent functions. The equation is:operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}-frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)-operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}+frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)=-frac{pi}{4}Hmm, arctangent difference equals -π/4. I remember that there&#39;s a formula for the difference of arctangent functions. Let me recall. The formula for arctan(a) - arctan(b) is arctan((a - b)/(1 + ab)), provided that the result is within the principal value. But here, instead of arctan(a) - arctan(b), we have arctan(a²) - arctan(b²) equals -π/4. Maybe I can use a similar approach.Let me denote:Let’s set A = (3x/22 - 11/(6x))² and B = (3x/22 + 11/(6x))².So the equation becomes:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.If I rearrange this, it&#39;s arctg(A) = arctg(B) - π/4.But I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s helpful. Maybe instead, use the identity for arctan(a) - arctan(b). Let me write:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = arctg[(A - B)/(1 + AB)] = -π/4.Wait, but the identity is arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan((a - b)/(1 + ab)) plus some multiple of π depending on the quadrant. But since the left-hand side is given as -π/4, which is negative, and arctan typically ranges between -π/2 and π/2, but the principal value is between -π/2 and π/2. So maybe the formula applies here.But if arctan[(A - B)/(1 + AB)] = -π/4, then (A - B)/(1 + AB) must be tan(-π/4) = -1.Therefore, (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1.So cross-multiplying:A - B = -1 - ABThen, bringing all terms to one side:A - B + AB + 1 = 0Factorizing:A(1 + B) - B + 1 = 0But maybe it&#39;s easier to substitute A and B back into the equation. Let me do that.First, let&#39;s compute A - B:A = (3x/22 - 11/(6x))²B = (3x/22 + 11/(6x))²So A - B = [ (3x/22 - 11/(6x))² - (3x/22 + 11/(6x))² ]This is a difference of squares: (C - D)² - (C + D)² = [C² - 2CD + D²] - [C² + 2CD + D²] = -4CDSo A - B = -4*(3x/22)*(11/(6x)).Let me compute that:First, compute C = 3x/22, D = 11/(6x)So A - B = -4*C*D = -4*(3x/22)*(11/(6x)).Simplify:Multiply numerator: 3x * 11 = 33xDenominator: 22 * 6x = 132xSo 33x / 132x = 33/132 = 1/4Hence, A - B = -4*(1/4) = -1Wow, that&#39;s neat. So A - B = -1.Then, from the equation (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1, substituting A - B = -1:-1/(1 + AB) = -1 =&gt; 1/(1 + AB) = 1 =&gt; 1 + AB = 1 =&gt; AB = 0Wait, but AB = 0 implies that either A = 0 or B = 0. But A and B are squares of real numbers, so they are non-negative. A = 0 only if 3x/22 - 11/(6x) = 0, and B = 0 only if 3x/22 + 11/(6x) = 0. Let&#39;s check if these can be zero.First, for A = 0:3x/22 - 11/(6x) = 0Multiply both sides by 6x:(3x/22)*(6x) - 11 = 0(18x²)/22 - 11 = 0(9x²)/11 - 11 = 09x² = 121x² = 121/9x = ±11/3 ≈ ±3.666...Similarly, B = 0:3x/22 + 11/(6x) = 0Multiply both sides by 6x:(3x/22)*(6x) + 11 = 0(18x²)/22 + 11 = 09x²/11 + 11 = 09x²/11 = -11x² = -121/9, which is impossible. So B cannot be zero.Therefore, the only way AB = 0 is if A = 0, which happens at x = ±11/3. But plugging these into the original equation, let&#39;s check:Take x = 11/3.Then, compute A = (3*(11/3)/22 - 11/(6*(11/3)))² = ( (11/22 - 11/(22)) )² = (0)² = 0B = (3*(11/3)/22 + 11/(6*(11/3)))² = (11/22 + 11/22)² = (22/22)² = 1² = 1So arctg(0) - arctg(1) = 0 - π/4 = -π/4. Which matches the equation. Similarly, x = -11/3:A = (3*(-11/3)/22 - 11/(6*(-11/3)))² = (-11/22 + 11/( -22))² = (-11/22 - 11/22)² = (-22/22)² = (-1)² = 1B = (3*(-11/3)/22 + 11/(6*(-11/3)))² = (-11/22 - 11/22)² = (-22/22)² = (-1)² = 1Then arctg(1) - arctg(1) = π/4 - π/4 = 0 ≠ -π/4. So x = -11/3 is not a solution.Therefore, x = 11/3 is a solution. But the problem says &quot;the larger root of the equation&quot;. So if x = 11/3 is a root, but maybe there&#39;s another root? Wait, but the equation reduces to AB = 0, which only gives x = 11/3 and x = -11/3, but x = -11/3 doesn&#39;t satisfy the equation. So is 11/3 the only solution? But 11/3 is approximately 3.666...But the problem refers to the larger root, implying there might be more than one root. Maybe I missed something.Wait, let&#39;s double-check the earlier steps. We had the equation arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4, and we set up the identity:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = arctg((A - B)/(1 + AB)) (mod π). But depending on the values of A and B, there could be a multiple of π involved. However, in our case, the equation is equal to -π/4, which is within the principal value range of arctg, so maybe the identity holds directly. Then, as we found, (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1, leading to AB = 0, giving x = ±11/3. But since only x = 11/3 works, is that the only solution?But perhaps there&#39;s another way to approach this. Let me think. Let&#39;s consider substituting y = 3x/22. Then, the equation becomes:arctg((y - 11/(6x))²) - arctg((y + 11/(6x))²) = -π/4.But maybe that substitution isn&#39;t helpful. Alternatively, notice that 3x/22 and 11/(6x) have some relation. Let me compute the product of 3x/22 and 11/(6x):(3x/22)*(11/(6x)) = (3*11*x)/(22*6x) = (33x)/(132x) = 33/132 = 1/4.Oh, interesting! So if we let a = 3x/22 and b = 11/(6x), then a*b = 1/4. Therefore, A = (a - b)², B = (a + b)². So A - B = -4ab = -4*(1/4) = -1, which is what we found before.So substituting back into the equation, we get:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4But since A - B = -1, and (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1/(1 + AB) = -1, so 1/(1 + AB) = 1 =&gt; AB = 0. But AB = (a - b)²*(a + b)² = [(a² - b²)]². Wait, no:Wait, A = (a - b)^2, B = (a + b)^2. So AB = (a - b)^2*(a + b)^2 = [(a - b)(a + b)]^2 = (a² - b²)^2. Since a*b = 1/4, then a² - b² could be something. Wait, but AB = 0 requires that (a² - b²)^2 = 0, so a² = b². Therefore, a = ±b. But since a = 3x/22 and b = 11/(6x). Let&#39;s see:Case 1: a = b3x/22 = 11/(6x)Multiply both sides by 6x*22:3x*6x = 11*2218x² = 242x² = 242/18 = 121/9x = ±11/3Case 2: a = -b3x/22 = -11/(6x)Multiply both sides by 6x*22:3x*6x = -11*2218x² = -242x² = -242/18, which is not possible.Therefore, only solutions are x = ±11/3. But as we saw before, x = -11/3 leads to arctg(1) - arctg(1) = 0, which is not -π/4, so only x = 11/3 is a solution.But the problem mentions &quot;the larger root&quot;, implying there&#39;s more than one. Maybe I need to check if there are other solutions. Wait, perhaps when I used the identity arctg(A) - arctg(B) = arctg((A - B)/(1 + AB)), I assumed that it holds, but depending on the signs of A and B, there might be other solutions.Let me recall the exact formula for arctg(a) - arctg(b). The formula is:arctg(a) - arctg(b) = arctg((a - b)/(1 + ab)) + kπ,where k is an integer chosen such that the result is in the correct quadrant. However, since the left-hand side of our equation is -π/4, which is between -π/2 and π/2, the principal value, so k=0. Therefore, the identity holds as arctg((A - B)/(1 + AB)) = -π/4. Therefore, we can safely use that formula here.Thus, (A - B)/(1 + AB) = tan(-π/4) = -1. Then, as we derived, A - B = -1 - AB, leading to AB = 0. Hence, the only solutions are when AB=0, which is only possible when A=0 or B=0. But B cannot be zero as we saw, so only A=0, leading to x=11/3.Therefore, the equation only has one real solution at x=11/3 ≈ 3.666..., so the integer closest to it would be 4. But the problem says &quot;the larger root&quot;, which is confusing if there&#39;s only one root. Wait, maybe there&#39;s another solution?Wait, let me check the substitution again. Let me suppose that AB is not zero. But according to our earlier steps, we arrive at AB=0. Let me verify that.Starting from (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1.We know that A - B = -1, so substituting that:-1/(1 + AB) = -1 =&gt; 1/(1 + AB) = 1 =&gt; 1 + AB = 1 =&gt; AB=0. So yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the equation reduces to AB=0, leading to only x=11/3 as a valid solution. Therefore, maybe the problem is a trick question where there&#39;s only one root, so the larger root is 11/3, which is approximately 3.666, so the closest integer is 4. But let me check again if there&#39;s another solution.Wait, suppose when we set up the equation, maybe there are other solutions where the arctg difference equals -π/4, but not using the identity. Let&#39;s consider the original equation:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.Let me think about possible values of A and B that can satisfy this. Since arctg(A) - arctg(B) is negative, arctg(A) &lt; arctg(B). Since arctg is an increasing function, this implies that A &lt; B.But A and B are both squares, so they are non-negative. So A &lt; B.Given that A = (3x/22 - 11/(6x))² and B = (3x/22 + 11/(6x))².Since (a - b)² &lt; (a + b)² when ab &gt; 0. Here, a = 3x/22 and b = 11/(6x). So ab = (3x/22)(11/(6x)) = (3*11)/(22*6) = (33)/(132) = 1/4 &gt; 0. Therefore, A &lt; B for all x ≠ 0. So arctg(A) - arctg(B) is always negative, which is consistent with the equation being -π/4. So maybe the only solution is when A=0, leading to x=11/3.Alternatively, perhaps even if A and B are not zero, there could be other solutions where arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4. Let me check with an example.Suppose A = 1 and B = something. If arctg(1) - arctg(B) = -π/4, then π/4 - arctg(B) = -π/4, so arctg(B) = π/2. But arctg(B) approaches π/2 as B approaches infinity. So if B is infinity, which is not possible. So this suggests that maybe the only solution is when A=0 and B=1.Alternatively, perhaps other combinations where A and B satisfy arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.But in general, solving arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.Let me set θ = arctg(A), φ = arctg(B). Then θ - φ = -π/4, so θ = φ - π/4.Taking tangent of both sides:tanθ = tan(φ - π/4) = (tanφ - tan(π/4))/(1 + tanφ tan(π/4)) = (tanφ - 1)/(1 + tanφ).But tanθ = A and tanφ = B. Therefore,A = (B - 1)/(1 + B)Multiply both sides by (1 + B):A(1 + B) = B - 1A + AB = B - 1A + 1 = B(1 - A)Therefore,B = (A + 1)/(1 - A)Since B = (3x/22 + 11/(6x))², and A = (3x/22 - 11/(6x))².But from here, we can express B in terms of A.Alternatively, since we already found that ab = 1/4, where a = 3x/22, b = 11/(6x), so a*b = 1/4.Also, A = (a - b)^2, B = (a + b)^2.So we can express A and B in terms of a and b.Given that ab = 1/4, let&#39;s set a and b such that ab = 1/4.Let me denote t = a - b, so A = t², and B = (a + b)^2.But since ab = 1/4, we can also express a + b in terms of t.We have (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² = (a - b)^2 + 4ab = t² + 4*(1/4) = t² + 1Therefore, B = t² + 1.Thus, from the previous equation:B = (A + 1)/(1 - A)But since B = t² + 1 and A = t²,t² + 1 = (t² + 1)/(1 - t²)Multiply both sides by (1 - t²):(t² + 1)(1 - t²) = t² + 1Expand left side:(t² + 1)(1 - t²) = (1 - t⁴)Thus,1 - t⁴ = t² + 1Bring all terms to left:1 - t⁴ - t² - 1 = 0 =&gt; -t⁴ - t² = 0 =&gt; t²(t² + 1) = 0Solutions: t² = 0 or t² = -1. Since t² cannot be negative, the only solution is t² = 0 =&gt; t = 0.Therefore, t = 0 =&gt; a - b = 0 =&gt; a = b. Which brings us back to the original solution where a = b, leading to x = 11/3.Therefore, the only solution is x = 11/3. Hence, the equation has only one real root at x = 11/3 ≈ 3.666..., so the integer closest to it is 4.But the problem says &quot;the larger root&quot;, which is confusing because there&#39;s only one root. Maybe the problem was expecting two roots, but due to the squaring, perhaps extraneous solutions? Wait, when we squared terms, we might have introduced extraneous solutions, but in this case, we only found one solution, and it checks out. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but given the problem as stated, the only root is 11/3.Wait, wait, wait. Let&#39;s think again. The original equation is:arctg((3x/22 - 11/(6x))²) - arctg((3x/22 + 11/(6x))²) = -π/4.But let me check for x negative. Suppose x is negative, say x = -11/3. Let&#39;s compute A and B:A = (3*(-11/3)/22 - 11/(6*(-11/3)))² = (-11/22 + 11/(-22))² = (-1/2 - 1/2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1B = (3*(-11/3)/22 + 11/(6*(-11/3)))² = (-11/22 - 11/22)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1So arctg(1) - arctg(1) = 0, which is not equal to -π/4, so x = -11/3 is not a solution.What about other x values? Let&#39;s suppose x is a different value, say x = 4. Let&#39;s compute A and B:a = 3*4/22 = 12/22 = 6/11 ≈ 0.545b = 11/(6*4) = 11/24 ≈ 0.458A = (a - b)^2 ≈ (0.545 - 0.458)^2 ≈ (0.087)^2 ≈ 0.0076B = (a + b)^2 ≈ (0.545 + 0.458)^2 ≈ (1.003)^2 ≈ 1.006Then arctg(A) ≈ arctg(0.0076) ≈ 0.0076 radiansarctg(B) ≈ arctg(1.006) ≈ π/4 + small value, since arctg(1) = π/4, and slightly larger.So arctg(A) - arctg(B) ≈ 0.0076 - (π/4 + ε) ≈ -0.777 - ε, which is much less than -π/4 ≈ -0.785. Wait, but it&#39;s actually close to -π/4. Wait, π/4 is approximately 0.785, so if arctg(B) is π/4 + ε, then the difference would be approximately -ε. Wait, maybe my approximations are off.Wait, let me compute more precisely. Let&#39;s compute B = (6/11 + 11/24)^2.First, compute 6/11 ≈ 0.545454..., 11/24 ≈ 0.458333...Adding them: ≈ 0.545454 + 0.458333 ≈ 1.003787...Square: ≈ (1.003787)^2 ≈ 1.00759...arctg(1.00759). Let&#39;s compute tan(π/4 + θ) = 1.00759.tan(π/4 + θ) = (1 + tanθ)/(1 - tanθ) ≈ 1 + 2θ (for small θ). But maybe a better way.Let me use a calculator approximation. arctg(1.00759). Since arctg(1) = π/4 ≈ 0.7854 radians. The derivative of arctg(x) at x=1 is 1/(1 + x²) = 1/2. So the linear approximation:arctg(1 + h) ≈ π/4 + (h)/2.Here, h = 0.00759, so arctg(1.00759) ≈ π/4 + 0.00759/2 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.003795 ≈ 0.789195 radians.Similarly, arctg(A) = arctg(0.0076) ≈ 0.0076 radians (since arctg(x) ≈ x for small x).Therefore, arctg(A) - arctg(B) ≈ 0.0076 - 0.789195 ≈ -0.7816 radians. Comparing to -π/4 ≈ -0.7854. So it&#39;s close, but not exactly. So x=4 gives a difference of approximately -0.7816, which is slightly larger than -π/4. So maybe there&#39;s a solution near x=4.Wait, but earlier we thought that the only solution is x=11/3 ≈3.666. But perhaps there&#39;s another solution?Wait, this suggests that perhaps there are two solutions? One at x=11/3 and another near x=4?Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, the equation reduces to AB=0, which only gives x=11/3. But if we substitute x=4, AB is not zero. So perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the logic?Wait, let me recap. We started with:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.We used the identity:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = arctg((A - B)/(1 + AB)).But this identity holds only when the difference is in (-π/2, π/2). In our case, the difference is -π/4, which is within that range. Therefore, the identity is valid here.Thus, the equation reduces to arctg((A - B)/(1 + AB)) = -π/4. Then, (A - B)/(1 + AB) = tan(-π/4) = -1. Then, A - B = -1 - AB. But we know that A - B = -1. Therefore, substituting:-1 = -1 - AB =&gt; 0 = -AB =&gt; AB=0.Hence, AB=0. Therefore, only possible when A=0 or B=0. Since B can&#39;t be zero, only A=0, leading to x=11/3.Therefore, according to this, x=11/3 is the only solution. However, when I tried x=4, I found that the difference is approximately -0.7816, which is close to -π/4 ≈ -0.7854. Maybe due to the approximate calculations, perhaps there is another solution near x=4. But according to the algebra, there is only one solution. There&#39;s a contradiction here.Wait, let me check x=4 more precisely.Compute A and B for x=4.First, compute 3x/22 = 12/22 = 6/11 ≈ 0.545454...11/(6x) = 11/(24) ≈ 0.458333...Then, A = (6/11 - 11/24)^2. Compute 6/11 - 11/24:Convert to common denominator, which is 264.6/11 = (6*24)/264 = 144/26411/24 = (11*11)/264 = 121/264Wait, 11/24 is (11*11)/264? Wait, no: 24*11=264, so 11/24 = (11*11)/264? No, wait:Wait, 6/11 - 11/24:The denominators are 11 and 24. LCM is 264.6/11 = (6*24)/264 = 144/26411/24 = (11*11)/264 = 121/264Wait, 6/11 - 11/24 = 144/264 - 121/264 = 23/264 ≈ 0.087121...Therefore, A = (23/264)^2 ≈ (0.087121)^2 ≈ 0.007589.Then, B = (6/11 + 11/24)^2. Compute 6/11 + 11/24:6/11 + 11/24 = 144/264 + 121/264 = 265/264 ≈ 1.003787...Therefore, B = (265/264)^2 ≈ (1.003787)^2 ≈ 1.00759.Now, compute arctg(A) - arctg(B):arctg(0.007589) ≈ 0.007589 (since arctg(x) ≈ x for small x)arctg(1.00759). Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.Let’s use the Taylor series expansion for arctg(x) around x=1.Let x = 1 + h, where h = 0.00759.The expansion is arctg(1 + h) = π/4 + (h)/2 - (h)^2/4 + (h)^3/12 + ...So with h = 0.00759:arctg(1.00759) ≈ π/4 + 0.00759/2 - (0.00759)^2/4 + (0.00759)^3/12Calculate each term:First term: π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634Second term: 0.00759/2 ≈ 0.003795Third term: (0.00759)^2 /4 ≈ (0.0000576)/4 ≈ 0.0000144Fourth term: (0.00759)^3 /12 ≈ (0.000000437)/12 ≈ 0.000000036Adding these up:0.7853981634 + 0.003795 ≈ 0.7891931634Subtract third term: 0.7891931634 - 0.0000144 ≈ 0.7891787634Add fourth term: negligible, ≈ 0.7891787634 + 0.000000036 ≈ 0.7891788So arctg(B) ≈ 0.7891788 radiansarctg(A) ≈ 0.007589 radiansTherefore, arctg(A) - arctg(B) ≈ 0.007589 - 0.7891788 ≈ -0.7815898 radiansCompare to -π/4 ≈ -0.7853981634. The difference is approximately 0.0038 radians, which is about 0.217 degrees. So it&#39;s close but not exactly -π/4. Therefore, x=4 is not a solution, but close to the actual solution. Maybe there&#39;s another solution near x=4?But according to our algebraic solution, there&#39;s only x=11/3. Let&#39;s check x=3.666..., which is 11/3 ≈ 3.666666...Compute A and B:x = 11/3 ≈ 3.666666...3x/22 = (3*(11/3))/22 = 11/22 = 0.511/(6x) = 11/(6*(11/3)) = 11/(22) = 0.5Therefore, A = (0.5 - 0.5)^2 = 0B = (0.5 + 0.5)^2 = 1^2 = 1Therefore, arctg(0) - arctg(1) = 0 - π/4 = -π/4, which is correct.If I take x slightly larger than 11/3, say x=4, we saw that the difference is ≈-0.7816, which is more than -π/4 ≈-0.7854. Wait, no: -0.7816 is greater than -0.7854. So it&#39;s closer to zero. So as x increases beyond 11/3, what happens to the difference?Let me try x=5.Compute a=3*5/22≈0.6818, b=11/(6*5)=11/30≈0.3667A=(a - b)^2≈(0.6818 - 0.3667)^2≈(0.3151)^2≈0.0993B=(a + b)^2≈(0.6818 + 0.3667)^2≈(1.0485)^2≈1.0993arctg(A)≈arctg(0.0993)≈0.0991 radiansarctg(B)≈arctg(1.0993). Compute this:1.0993 is tan(π/4 + θ). Let&#39;s approximate:tan(π/4 + θ) = (1 + tanθ)/(1 - tanθ) = 1.0993Let’s set tanθ ≈ h. Then,(1 + h)/(1 - h) ≈1.0993Solving for h:1 + h =1.0993*(1 - h)1 + h =1.0993 -1.0993hh +1.0993h =1.0993 -12.0993h=0.0993h≈0.0993/2.0993≈0.0473Thus, θ≈0.0473 radiansTherefore, arctg(1.0993)=π/4 +0.0473≈0.7854+0.0473≈0.8327 radiansTherefore, difference≈0.0991 -0.8327≈-0.7336 radians, which is less negative than -π/4, so moving away from -π/4 as x increases.Similarly, if we take x=3.5:x=3.5=7/2Compute a=3*(7/2)/22=21/44≈0.4773b=11/(6*(7/2))=11/(21)≈0.5238A=(a - b)^2≈(0.4773 -0.5238)^2≈(-0.0465)^2≈0.00216B=(a + b)^2≈(0.4773 +0.5238)^2≈(1.0011)^2≈1.0022arctg(A)=arctg(0.00216)≈0.00216 radiansarctg(B)=arctg(1.0022). Let&#39;s compute this similarly:1.0022=tan(π/4 + θ). Solve for θ:(1 + tanθ)/(1 - tanθ)=1.0022Let tanθ=h.(1 + h)/(1 - h)=1.00221 + h=1.0022*(1 - h)1 + h=1.0022 -1.0022hh +1.0022h=1.0022 -12.0022h=0.0022h≈0.0022/2.0022≈0.0011Therefore, θ≈0.0011 radiansarctg(B)=π/4 +0.0011≈0.7854+0.0011≈0.7865 radiansDifference≈0.00216 -0.7865≈-0.7843 radians, which is very close to -π/4≈-0.7854. So x=3.5 gives a difference of≈-0.7843, which is very close to -π/4.Therefore, perhaps there is another solution near x=3.5? But according to our previous analysis, there should only be x=11/3. What&#39;s going on?Wait, let me check x=3.5. If the difference is≈-0.7843, which is ≈-π/4, then perhaps there is a solution near x=3.5. But according to the algebraic solution, the only solution is x=11/3≈3.6667. Hmm, but x=3.5 is less than 11/3. So maybe our algebraic solution is missing something?Wait, when we set up the equation (A - B)/(1 + AB) = -1, we assumed that it&#39;s equivalent to arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4. But maybe there are other solutions where (A - B)/(1 + AB) = tan(-π/4 + kπ), but since tan is periodic with period π. However, the principal value of arctg is between -π/2 and π/2, so the equation arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4 must lie within that range. Therefore, k=0 is the only possibility, so (A - B)/(1 + AB) must equal -1, leading to AB=0. Hence, only x=11/3.But when I plugged in x=3.5, I got the difference very close to -π/4. Perhaps there&#39;s a solution near x=3.5?Wait, let&#39;s set up the equation again:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4Let’s define f(x) = arctg(A) - arctg(B) + π/4. We need to find x such that f(x)=0.We know that at x=11/3, f(x)=0. We saw that at x=3.5, f(x)=arctg(A) - arctg(B) + π/4≈-0.7843 +0.7854≈0.0011≈0. So x=3.5 is very close to a solution. Is there actually a solution near x=3.5 or is it just numerical approximation error?Wait, let&#39;s compute more precisely for x=3.5:x=3.5=7/2Compute a=3*(7/2)/22=21/44≈0.4772727b=11/(6*(7/2))=11/(21)=≈0.5238095A=(a - b)^2=( -0.0465368 )^2≈0.002165B=(a + b)^2=(0.4772727 +0.5238095)^2=(1.001082)^2≈1.002166Now compute arctg(A) and arctg(B):arctg(0.002165). Since A is small, arctg(A)≈0.002165 radians.arctg(1.002166). Let&#39;s compute it more accurately.Using the formula arctg(1 + h)≈π/4 + h/2 - h²/4 + h³/12, where h=0.002166.h=0.002166First term: π/4≈0.7853981634Second term: h/2=0.001083Third term: -h²/4≈-(0.002166)^2 /4≈-0.0000047/4≈-0.000001175Fourth term: h³/12≈(0.002166)^3 /12≈0.0000000101 /12≈0.00000000084Adding them up:0.7853981634 +0.001083≈0.7864811634-0.000001175≈0.7864800+0.00000000084≈0.7864800So arctg(B)≈0.7864800 radiansarctg(A)=0.002165 radiansTherefore, f(x)=0.002165 -0.7864800 +0.785398≈0.002165 -0.7864800 +0.785398≈(0.002165 +0.785398) -0.7864800≈0.787563 -0.7864800≈0.001083 radians≈0.062 degrees.So f(x)=0.001083 radians, which is not zero. Therefore, x=3.5 gives f(x)=≈0.0011≈0.06 degrees, which is very close to zero but not exactly.Similarly, x=3.6:Compute a=3*3.6/22=10.8/22≈0.4909b=11/(6*3.6)=11/21.6≈0.5093A=(0.4909 -0.5093)^2≈(-0.0184)^2≈0.000339B=(0.4909 +0.5093)^2≈1.0002^2≈1.0004arctg(A)=≈0.000339 radiansarctg(B)=arctg(1.0004). Let&#39;s compute:h=0.0004arctg(1.0004)≈π/4 +0.0004/2≈0.7854 +0.0002≈0.7856 radiansThus, f(x)=0.000339 -0.7856 +0.7854≈0.000339 -0.0002≈0.000139≈0.008 degrees.Still not zero, but even closer.Similarly, x=3.65:a=3*3.65/22≈10.95/22≈0.4977b=11/(6*3.65)=11/21.9≈0.5023A=(0.4977 -0.5023)^2≈(-0.0046)^2≈0.000021B=(0.4977 +0.5023)^2≈1.0^2=1.0Thus, arctg(A)=≈0.000021 radiansarctg(B)=π/4≈0.7854 radiansf(x)=0.000021 -0.7854 +0.7854≈0.000021≈0.0012 degrees. Still not zero.So as x approaches 11/3≈3.666..., A approaches 0 and B approaches 1, so f(x) approaches 0 - π/4 + π/4 =0. Therefore, x=11/3 is the exact solution. So the function f(x) approaches zero as x approaches 11/3 from below or above, but due to the squaring, the approach is very flat near x=11/3. Therefore, x=11/3 is the only solution.But when I tried x=3.5, the difference was very close to -π/4, but not exactly. So why is that?Because when x is near 11/3, the expression A becomes very small, so arctg(A) is approximately A, and B approaches 1, so arctg(B) approaches π/4. Therefore, the difference arctg(A) - arctg(B)≈A - π/4. So setting A - π/4 = -π/4 =&gt; A=0. Hence, the only solution is when A=0.Therefore, the only exact solution is x=11/3. Any x near 11/3 will give a difference close to -π/4 but not exactly. Therefore, the problem likely only has x=11/3 as a solution.Therefore, the integer closest to the larger root is 4.But why does the problem mention &quot;the larger root&quot;? Maybe there&#39;s a misunderstanding. Perhaps the equation has two roots, but due to the squaring in the arctg arguments, but according to the earlier analysis, there&#39;s only one real root. Alternatively, maybe the equation can be manipulated to a quadratic equation leading to two roots.Wait, let me check. When we set AB=0, we found x=11/3. But maybe there&#39;s another solution from another branch?Wait, the original equation is:arctg(A) - arctg(B) = -π/4.But arctg(A) and arctg(B) are both in the range (-π/2, π/2). The difference could be in (-π, π). But the given difference is -π/4, which is within (-π/2, π/2), so the identity should hold.Alternatively, maybe considering multiple turns, but since arctg is defined as principal value, I don&#39;t think so.Alternatively, suppose we let y = (3x/22 - 11/(6x)) and z = (3x/22 + 11/(6x)), then the equation is arctg(y²) - arctg(z²) = -π/4.But we found that y² - z² = -4ab = -1, and with ab=1/4. So this seems to lead to the same conclusion.Alternatively, if we let u = 3x/22 and v = 11/(6x), then the equation is arctg((u - v)^2) - arctg((u + v)^2) = -π/4, with u*v=1/4.Let me see if there&#39;s any other solution apart from u=v.We found that u=v leads to u=v=1/2 (since u*v=1/4, so u=v=1/2). Therefore, 3x/22=1/2 =&gt; x= (1/2)*(22/3)=11/3. Which is the solution we have.Alternatively, could there be another pair u and v such that (u - v)^2 and (u + v)^2 satisfy the equation?But from the previous analysis using t = u - v, we saw that the only solution is t=0, leading to u=v=1/2.Therefore, there are no other solutions.Thus, the problem&#39;s mention of &quot;the larger root&quot; might be a red herring, or perhaps a translation error, or maybe there&#39;s an intention to consider complex roots, but the problem specifies indicating the integer closest to the larger root, implying real roots. Since there&#39;s only one real root, the answer is 4.Therefore, the integer closest to the larger root (which is 11/3≈3.666...) is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation:operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}-frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)-operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}+frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)=-frac{pi}{4}we denote ( A = left(frac{3x}{22} - frac{11}{6x}right)^2 ) and ( B = left(frac{3x}{22} + frac{11}{6x}right)^2 ). The equation simplifies to:operatorname{arctg}(A) - operatorname{arctg}(B) = -frac{pi}{4}Using the identity for the difference of arctangents, we have:operatorname{arctg}(A) - operatorname{arctg}(B) = operatorname{arctg}left(frac{A - B}{1 + AB}right)Given the equation, this implies:frac{A - B}{1 + AB} = tanleft(-frac{pi}{4}right) = -1Solving this, we get:A - B = -1 - ABSubstituting ( A ) and ( B ) back, we find:left(frac{3x}{22} - frac{11}{6x}right)^2 - left(frac{3x}{22} + frac{11}{6x}right)^2 = -1This simplifies to:-4 left(frac{3x}{22} cdot frac{11}{6x}right) = -1Simplifying the product inside the parentheses:frac{3x}{22} cdot frac{11}{6x} = frac{1}{4}Thus, the equation reduces to:-4 cdot frac{1}{4} = -1This confirms the equation holds. We then check the roots where ( A = 0 ) or ( B = 0 ). Solving ( A = 0 ):frac{3x}{22} - frac{11}{6x} = 0Solving this gives ( x = pm frac{11}{3} ). Checking these values, only ( x = frac{11}{3} ) satisfies the original equation. The integer closest to ( frac{11}{3} approx 3.666 ) is 4. Thus, the final answer is:boxed{4},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this equation to solve: operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}-frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)-operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}+frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)=-frac{pi}{4}Hmm, arctangent functions subtracting to give -π/4. I remember that arctangent has some subtraction formulas. Maybe I can use the identity for arctg(a) - arctg(b)? Let me recall. The formula is:arctg(a) - arctg(b) = arctgleft(frac{a - b}{1 + ab}right)But this is true when considering the principal value, right? So depending on the values of a and b, we might have to adjust by adding or subtracting π. But in this problem, the result is -π/4, which is within the principal range of arctg, which is (-π/2, π/2). Wait, but -π/4 is within that range. So maybe the identity can be directly applied here.Let me denote:Let’s set A = arctg((3x/22 - 11/(6x))²) and B = arctg((3x/22 + 11/(6x))²). Then according to the problem, A - B = -π/4. So, A = B - π/4. Then, applying tangent to both sides:tan(A) = tan(B - π/4) = [tan B - tan(π/4)] / [1 + tan B tan(π/4)] = (tan B - 1)/(1 + tan B)Because tan(π/4) = 1.But tan A is (3x/22 - 11/(6x))², and tan B is (3x/22 + 11/(6x))². Let me denote:Let’s let u = 3x/22 and v = 11/(6x). Then the equation becomes:arctg((u - v)^2) - arctg((u + v)^2) = -π/4So, using the substitution:A = arctg((u - v)^2), B = arctg((u + v)^2)Then, A - B = -π/4 =&gt; tan(A - B) = tan(-π/4) = -1But using the formula for tan(A - B):tan(A - B) = [tan A - tan B] / [1 + tan A tan B] = -1So:[tan A - tan B] / [1 + tan A tan B] = -1Which implies:tan A - tan B = -1 - tan A tan BBring all terms to the left:tan A - tan B + tan A tan B + 1 = 0Factor this equation. Let me see:tan A (1 + tan B) - (tan B - 1) = 0? Hmm, maybe not obvious. Alternatively, group terms:tan A (1 + tan B) + (- tan B + 1) = 0Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write tan A as a and tan B as b. Then:(a - b)/(1 + ab) = -1Therefore:a - b = -1 - abWhich gives:a - b + ab + 1 = 0Factor:a(1 + b) + ( - b + 1 ) = 0? Hmm, not straightforward. Alternatively, rearrange:ab + a - b + 1 = 0Factor:a(b + 1) - (b - 1) = 0Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let&#39;s substitute back a and b.a = (u - v)^2, b = (u + v)^2.So:(u - v)^2 * (u + v)^2 + (u - v)^2 - (u + v)^2 + 1 = 0Wait, that&#39;s going to be complicated. Let me compute each term step by step.First, compute ab = (u - v)^2 (u + v)^2. That&#39;s [(u - v)(u + v)]^2 = (u² - v²)^2.Then, a - b = (u - v)^2 - (u + v)^2. Let&#39;s compute that:(u - v)^2 - (u + v)^2 = [u² - 2uv + v²] - [u² + 2uv + v²] = -4uvSo from the equation:a - b = -1 - abWhich is:-4uv = -1 - (u² - v²)^2Multiply both sides by -1:4uv = 1 + (u² - v²)^2So, we have:(u² - v²)^2 + 1 = 4uvInteresting. Let me write that equation:(u² - v²)^2 - 4uv + 1 = 0Now, let&#39;s substitute back u and v.Given that u = 3x/22 and v = 11/(6x). So, u = 3x/22, v = 11/(6x). Let&#39;s compute u² and v²:u² = (9x²)/(484), v² = (121)/(36x²)Then, u² - v² = (9x²/484) - (121)/(36x²)Let’s compute that:Let’s write both terms with a common denominator. The denominators are 484 and 36x². The common denominator would be 484 * 36x². But this might get messy. Maybe instead, let me denote:Let’s let’s compute (u² - v²)^2:= [ (9x²/484 - 121/(36x²) ) ]²Let me compute that term:First, factor out 1/(484 * 36x²) to make it easier? Maybe not. Alternatively, express both terms with denominator 4356x², which is 484 * 9x². Wait, 484 is 22², 36 is 6².Alternatively, let me compute the expression step by step.Compute u² - v²:= (9x²)/484 - 121/(36x²)To combine these terms, find a common denominator. Let&#39;s compute the LCM of 484 and 36x². Since 484 = 4 * 121 = 4 * 11², and 36 = 4 * 9. The LCM would be 4 * 9 * 121 * x² = 4356x². So:= [9x² * 36x² - 121 * 484] / (484 * 36x²)Wait, no. To combine (9x²)/484 and 121/(36x²), the common denominator is 484 * 36x².Thus:= [9x² * 36x² - 121 * 484] / (484 * 36x²)Compute numerator:9x² * 36x² = 324x⁴121 * 484: 121 is 11², 484 is 22² = (2*11)² = 4*121. So 121 * 484 = 121 * 4 * 121 = 4 * 121² = 4 * 14641 = 58564So numerator is 324x⁴ - 58564Therefore:u² - v² = (324x⁴ - 58564)/(484 * 36x²) = (324x⁴ - 58564)/(17424x²)But this seems complicated. Let me check if there is a better way.Wait, maybe instead of substituting u and v in terms of x, we can work with the equation (u² - v²)^2 + 1 = 4uv.Let’s write (u² - v²)^2 = (u² + v² - 2u²v²)? Wait, no. Wait, (u² - v²)^2 = u⁴ - 2u²v² + v⁴.So the equation is:u⁴ - 2u²v² + v⁴ + 1 = 4uvHmm, still complicated. Maybe there is a substitution here. Let me consider setting t = uv. Then, perhaps express u⁴ + v⁴ in terms of t?But let&#39;s see:If t = uv, then u²v² = t². Also, u⁴ + v⁴ = (u² + v²)^2 - 2u²v² = (u² + v²)^2 - 2t². But not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe notice that u and v are related. Since u = 3x/22 and v = 11/(6x), then:uv = (3x/22)(11/(6x)) = (3*11)/(22*6) * x/x = (33)/(132) = 1/4.Oh! That&#39;s a key relation. uv = 1/4.So, t = uv = 1/4.Therefore, in our equation:(u² - v²)^2 + 1 = 4uv = 4*(1/4) = 1Wait, so (u² - v²)^2 +1 =1 =&gt; (u² - v²)^2 =0 =&gt; u² - v² =0.Therefore, u² = v².So, from u² = v²:(3x/22)^2 = (11/(6x))^2Take square roots:3x/22 = ±11/(6x)But since u and v are real numbers, x cannot be zero. So, we can solve for x.Case 1: 3x/22 = 11/(6x)Multiply both sides by 6x:(3x/22)*6x = 11(18x²)/22 =11Multiply both sides by 22:18x² = 242x² = 242/18 = 121/9x = ±11/3Case 2: 3x/22 = -11/(6x)Multiply both sides by 6x:(3x/22)*6x = -11(18x²)/22 = -11Multiply both sides by 22:18x² = -242x² = -242/18This is not possible since x² can&#39;t be negative. So, only solutions are x = ±11/3.But let&#39;s check these solutions in the original equation. Because sometimes when dealing with squared terms and arctg, we might have extraneous solutions.First, check x = 11/3.Compute u = 3x/22 = 3*(11/3)/22 = 11/22 = 1/2v = 11/(6x) = 11/(6*(11/3)) = 11/(22) = 1/2So, (u - v)^2 = (1/2 - 1/2)^2 = 0(u + v)^2 = (1/2 + 1/2)^2 = 1^2 = 1Therefore, arctg(0) - arctg(1) = 0 - π/4 = -π/4. Which matches the equation. So, x = 11/3 is a valid solution.Now, check x = -11/3.Compute u = 3x/22 = 3*(-11/3)/22 = -11/22 = -1/2v = 11/(6x) = 11/(6*(-11/3)) = 11/(-22) = -1/2Then, (u - v)^2 = (-1/2 - (-1/2))^2 = 0^2 = 0(u + v)^2 = (-1/2 + (-1/2))^2 = (-1)^2 = 1Thus, arctg(0) - arctg(1) = 0 - π/4 = -π/4. So, this also satisfies the equation. Therefore, x = -11/3 is also a valid solution.So, the equation has two real roots: 11/3 and -11/3. The problem asks for the integer closest to the larger root. The larger root is 11/3, which is approximately 3.666... So, the closest integer is 4.But wait, let me confirm. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666..., so 3.666 is closer to 4 than to 3, since 3.666 - 3 = 0.666, and 4 - 3.666 = 0.333. Yes, 0.333 is less than 0.666, so it&#39;s closer to 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.Wait, but let me double-check if there are any other solutions. We found that (u² - v²)^2 =0 leads to u² = v², which gives x = ±11/3.But could there be other solutions when we considered the arctg subtraction formula? Let&#39;s recall that when using tan(A - B) = -1, we assumed that A - B = -π/4. However, arctg can have multiple branches, but since the principal value is between -π/2 and π/2, and the difference is -π/4, which is within that range, so there shouldn&#39;t be other solutions. Also, when we solved the equation, we arrived uniquely at x = ±11/3. Thus, those are the only solutions.Therefore, the larger root is 11/3 ≈ 3.666..., so the closest integer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation:operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}-frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)-operatorname{arctg}left(left(frac{3 x}{22}+frac{11}{6 x}right)^{2}right)=-frac{pi}{4}We start by denoting ( u = frac{3x}{22} ) and ( v = frac{11}{6x} ). This transforms the equation into:operatorname{arctg}((u - v)^2) - operatorname{arctg}((u + v)^2) = -frac{pi}{4}Using the tangent subtraction formula, we find:tan(operatorname{arctg}((u - v)^2) - operatorname{arctg}((u + v)^2)) = tanleft(-frac{pi}{4}right) = -1This leads to the equation:frac{(u - v)^2 - (u + v)^2}{1 + (u - v)^2 (u + v)^2} = -1Simplifying the numerator and denominator, we get:frac{-4uv}{1 + (u^2 - v^2)^2} = -1This simplifies to:4uv = 1 + (u^2 - v^2)^2Given ( uv = frac{1}{4} ), we substitute ( uv ) into the equation:4 cdot frac{1}{4} = 1 + (u^2 - v^2)^2This simplifies to:1 = 1 + (u^2 - v^2)^2Thus, ( (u^2 - v^2)^2 = 0 ), leading to ( u^2 = v^2 ). Solving for ( x ), we get:left(frac{3x}{22}right)^2 = left(frac{11}{6x}right)^2This results in ( x = pm frac{11}{3} ). The larger root is ( frac{11}{3} approx 3.666 ), which is closest to the integer 4.Thus, the integer closest to the larger root is:boxed{4}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5286df18></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5286df18><span class="icon" data-v-5286df18>🔑:</span>Solution.

The problem says:&quot;The sum of two natural numbers is 2014. If you strike out the last two digits of one of them, multiply the resulting number by three, you get a number that is six more than the other number. Find these numbers. Enter the smallest of them in the provided field.&quot;Okay, so we have two natural numbers, let&#39;s call them x and y. Their sum is 2014, so:x + y = 2014That&#39;s straightforward. Now, the second part of the problem is a bit trickier. It says if you strike out the last two digits of one of them, multiply the resulting number by three, you get a number that is six more than the other number.First, I need to figure out which number we&#39;re supposed to strike out the last two digits from. The problem says &quot;one of them,&quot; so it could be either x or y. But maybe there&#39;s a clue here. If we strike out the last two digits, that implies the number has at least three digits, right? Because you can&#39;t strike out two digits from a number with fewer than two digits. Wait, actually, natural numbers are positive integers, so the smallest is 1. But striking out two digits from a number with two digits would leave you with nothing? Hmm, maybe the number has to have at least three digits so that striking out the last two leaves at least one digit. For example, if the number is 123, striking out the last two digits gives 1. Then multiply by three to get 3, which is six more than the other number. But 3 is six more than something, which would have to be negative, which isn&#39;t a natural number. So maybe the number has more than two digits. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe the number is a four-digit number. Since the sum is 2014, which is a four-digit number, so the two numbers could be a four-digit and a three-digit number, or a three-digit and another three-digit, but 2014 is the sum. Let me check: the maximum possible value for one number is 2013 (if the other is 1), so the numbers can be up to four digits. So, if one of the numbers is a four-digit number, say in the range 1000-2013, then striking out the last two digits would give us the first two digits. For example, if the number is 1234, striking out the last two digits gives 12, then multiplying by three gives 36, which should be six more than the other number. So the other number would be 36 - 6 = 30. But then 1234 + 30 = 1264, which is less than 2014. Hmm, so maybe that&#39;s not the case.Alternatively, if the number we strike out the last two digits from is a three-digit number. Wait, but a three-digit number, if you strike out the last two digits, you get the first digit. For example, 123 becomes 1, then multiplying by three gives 3, which is six more than the other number, so the other number would be -3, which isn&#39;t natural. So that can&#39;t be. Therefore, maybe the number we strike out from must be a four-digit number? Let&#39;s test that.Suppose one number is a four-digit number, say abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits). Striking out the last two digits would give us ab. Then multiplying by three gives 3*(ab), which is equal to the other number plus six. So 3*(ab) = other number + 6. Since the sum of the two numbers is 2014, then we have:Let me formalize this. Let’s let x be the four-digit number. Then striking out the last two digits gives us the first two digits, which is equivalent to dividing x by 100 and taking the integer part. For example, if x is 1234, then x//100 = 12. Then multiply by three: 12*3 = 36. Then that is six more than the other number y, so 36 = y + 6 =&gt; y = 30. Then x + y = 1234 + 30 = 1264, which is not 2014. So that doesn&#39;t work. Hmm.But in our problem, the sum is 2014, which is a specific number, so maybe the numbers need to be such that when we do this operation, it works out. Let&#39;s define variables properly.Let me let x be the number from which we strike out the last two digits. Then x must be a natural number with at least three digits? Wait, if we strike out the last two digits, then the number could be two digits? For example, if x is 10, striking out the last two digits would leave nothing? That doesn&#39;t make sense. So perhaps x must have at least three digits. Wait, but 100 is a three-digit number. Striking out the last two digits gives 1. Then 1*3 = 3, so the other number would be 3 - 6 = -3, which is not natural. Therefore, maybe x must be a four-digit number. Let&#39;s suppose x is a four-digit number. Let me formalize:Let x be the four-digit number. Then x can be written as 100*a + b, where a is a two-digit number (from 10 to 99) and b is the last two digits (from 00 to 99). Wait, but if we strike out the last two digits, we get a, so the problem states:3*a = y + 6And x + y = 2014Therefore, substituting y = 3*a - 6 into the sum equation:x + (3*a - 6) = 2014But x is 100*a + b, so:100*a + b + 3*a - 6 = 2014Simplify:103*a + b - 6 = 2014Therefore:103*a + b = 2020But since b is the last two digits of x, b must be between 0 and 99 (inclusive). So:103*a = 2020 - bSince 2020 - b must be divisible by 103, and 2020 - b is between 2020 - 99 = 1921 and 2020 - 0 = 2020.So we need to find an integer a such that 103*a is in [1921, 2020]Let me compute 1921 / 103 ≈ 18.65, and 2020 / 103 ≈ 19.6. So a must be 19, since 103*19 = 1957.Wait, 103*19 = 1957. Then 2020 - 1957 = 63. So b = 63.Therefore, x = 100*a + b = 100*19 + 63 = 1900 + 63 = 1963Then y = 3*a - 6 = 3*19 -6 = 57 -6 = 51Check x + y = 1963 + 51 = 2014, which is correct.Check the second condition: strike out last two digits of x (1963) gives 19, multiply by three is 57, which should be six more than y. y is 51, so 57 - 51 = 6. Correct.Therefore, the numbers are 1963 and 51. The smallest is 51.Wait, but let me verify if there are other possible values for a. Let&#39;s see:We had 103*a + b = 2020, with 0 ≤ b ≤ 99. So a must satisfy 103*a ≤ 2020, so a ≤ 2020/103 ≈19.6. So a can be at most 19. Then check a=19: 103*19=1957, so b=2020-1957=63. Which is valid.a=18: 103*18=1854, then b=2020-1854=166. But b can&#39;t be 166, since b is a two-digit number (00 to 99). So invalid.Similarly, a=20: 103*20=2060, which is more than 2020, so invalid. Therefore, only a=19 is possible. Therefore, x=1963 and y=51. So the answer is 51.Wait, but let me check if there&#39;s another interpretation. The problem says &quot;strike out the last two digits of one of them&quot;. Maybe the other number is the one we have to strike out the digits? Wait, the problem says &quot;If you strike out the last two digits of one of them, multiply the resulting number by three, you get a number that is six more than the other number.&quot; So it&#39;s either x or y. So maybe we need to check both possibilities.Case 1: Strike out last two digits of x, then 3*(striked_x) = y +6Case 2: Strike out last two digits of y, then 3*(striked_y) = x +6We need to check both cases.So earlier we did case 1, assuming x is the four-digit number. Let&#39;s check case 2: strike out last two digits of y, then 3*(striked_y) = x +6. But y must be at least a three-digit number. However, since x + y =2014, if y is a three-digit number, x would be 2014 - y, which is at least 2014 - 999 = 1015. So x would be a four-digit number. Let&#39;s formalize case 2:Let y be the number from which we strike out the last two digits, so y is a three or four-digit number. Let&#39;s suppose y is a three-digit number. Then striking out the last two digits would leave a single digit. For example, y=123, strike out last two digits gives 1. Then 1*3 = 3 = x +6 =&gt; x= -3, invalid. So y must be a four-digit number? If y is a four-digit number, then x = 2014 - y would be 2014 - (1000 to 2013). So x could be from 1 to 1014. Let&#39;s suppose y is a four-digit number.Then y = 100*c + d, where c is the first two digits (10 to 20, since y is four-digit up to 2013). Wait, but 2014 - y = x, so y can be up to 2013, so c can be up to 20 (since 20*100 = 2000). Then striking out last two digits gives c, so 3*c = x +6. Then x = 3*c -6. Then x + y = 2014, so:(3*c -6) + y = 2014But y = 100*c + d, where d is between 0 and 99.So substituting:3*c -6 + 100*c + d = 2014103*c + d -6 = 2014103*c + d = 2020Again, d must be between 0 and 99, so 103*c = 2020 - d.Therefore, 103*c must be in [2020 -99, 2020] = [1921, 2020]Same as before. Then c must be 19, since 103*19=1957. Then d=2020 -1957=63. Therefore, y=100*c + d=1900 +63=1963. Then x=3*c -6=57 -6=51. Therefore, x=51, y=1963. So same numbers as before, just swapped. Therefore, in either case, the two numbers are 51 and 1963. So the smallest is 51.Therefore, the answer is 51.Final AnswerThe smallest number is boxed{51}.&lt;/think&gt;Given two natural numbers ( x ) and ( y ) such that their sum is 2014, we need to find these numbers under the condition that striking out the last two digits of one of them, multiplying the resulting number by three, gives a number that is six more than the other number.We start by defining the equations based on the problem statement:1. ( x + y = 2014 )2. If we strike out the last two digits of one number, multiply by three, and get six more than the other number, we need to consider both possibilities for which number ( ( x ) or ( y ) ) is being modified. Case 1: Striking out the last two digits of ( x )- Let ( x ) be a four-digit number, written as ( 100a + b ) where ( a ) is the first two digits and ( b ) is the last two digits.- Striking out the last two digits gives ( a ), then multiplying by three gives ( 3a ).- According to the problem, ( 3a = y + 6 ).- Substituting ( y = 3a - 6 ) into the sum equation:  [  100a + b + 3a - 6 = 2014  ]  Simplifying, we get:  [  103a + b = 2020  ]- Since ( b ) must be between 0 and 99, we solve for ( a ):  [  103a = 2020 - b  ]  The valid solution is ( a = 19 ) and ( b = 63 ), giving ( x = 1963 ) and ( y = 51 ). Case 2: Striking out the last two digits of ( y )- Let ( y ) be a four-digit number, written as ( 100c + d ) where ( c ) is the first two digits and ( d ) is the last two digits.- Striking out the last two digits gives ( c ), then multiplying by three gives ( 3c ).- According to the problem, ( 3c = x + 6 ).- Substituting ( x = 3c - 6 ) into the sum equation:  [  3c - 6 + 100c + d = 2014  ]  Simplifying, we get:  [  103c + d = 2020  ]- Similarly, solving for ( c ) gives ( c = 19 ) and ( d = 63 ), resulting in ( y = 1963 ) and ( x = 51 ).In both cases, the numbers are 51 and 1963. The smallest number is (boxed{51}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. So, the problem says that the sum of two natural numbers is 2014. When you strike out the last two digits of one of them, multiply the resulting number by three, you get a number that is six more than the other number. We need to find these numbers and enter the smallest one. Alright, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, let&#39;s denote the two natural numbers as x and y, where x + y = 2014. Without loss of generality, let&#39;s assume that x is the number from which we strike out the last two digits. Striking out the last two digits of a number essentially means dividing it by 100 and taking the integer part. For example, if x is 3456, striking out the last two digits gives 34. So, mathematically, this operation is equivalent to floor(x / 100). But since x is a natural number, if x has at least three digits, then striking out the last two digits would be x divided by 100 and rounded down. However, if x has fewer than three digits, striking out the last two digits would result in 0. But since we&#39;re dealing with natural numbers and their sum is 2014, which is a four-digit number, it&#39;s more likely that both numbers are at least three digits or more. Let&#39;s proceed with that assumption.So, if we strike out the last two digits of x, we get floor(x / 100). Let&#39;s call this value k. Then, according to the problem, multiplying k by 3 gives us a number that&#39;s six more than the other number y. So, 3k = y + 6. Therefore, y = 3k - 6.But we also know that x + y = 2014. Substituting y in the equation, we get x + 3k - 6 = 2014. Therefore, x = 2014 - 3k + 6 = 2020 - 3k.But remember that k is floor(x / 100). Since k is derived from x, we need to express this relationship properly. Let&#39;s think about it. If k = floor(x / 100), then x can be written as x = 100k + m, where m is the number formed by the last two digits of x. Since m is the last two digits, m must be between 0 and 99 inclusive. So, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 99.But earlier, we found that x = 2020 - 3k. Therefore, combining these two expressions for x:100k + m = 2020 - 3kRearranging terms:100k + 3k + m = 2020103k + m = 2020But m is between 0 and 99. So, 103k ≤ 2020 ≤ 103k + 99Let&#39;s solve for k. Let&#39;s first find k such that 103k ≤ 2020. So, k ≤ 2020 / 103. Let&#39;s calculate that:2020 divided by 103. Let me do that division. 103*19 = 1957, because 100*19=1900 and 3*19=57, so 1900+57=1957. Then 2020 - 1957 = 63. So 2020 = 103*19 + 63. Therefore, 2020 /103 = 19 + 63/103 ≈19.611. Since k must be an integer, the maximum possible k is 19.But also, from 2020 -103k ≥0, since m must be non-negative. So, k ≤19. And also, from the other inequality, 103k +99 ≥2020. Let&#39;s see:103k +99 ≥2020103k ≥2020 -99 =1921k ≥1921/103. Let&#39;s compute that. 103*18=1854, 1921 -1854=67. So, 1921/103=18 +67/103≈18.650. So, k must be at least 19. Therefore, k can only be 19.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, k must be exactly 19. Because if k was 18, then 103*18=1854, which would make m=2020 -103*18=2020-1854=166. But m must be less than 100. So, 166 is greater than 99, which is invalid. Therefore, k can&#39;t be 18. Similarly, k=19:103*19=1957. Then m=2020 -1957=63. So, m=63, which is valid because 0 ≤63 ≤99.Therefore, k=19 and m=63.Therefore, x=100k +m=100*19 +63=1900 +63=1963.Then y=2014 -x=2014 -1963=51.Wait, but according to the earlier equation, y=3k -6=3*19 -6=57-6=51. Which matches. So, that seems consistent.But let&#39;s check the original problem again to make sure.The sum is 1963 +51=2014. Correct.Strike out the last two digits of one of them (1963), which gives 19. Multiply by 3: 19*3=57. Then, 57 is six more than the other number (51). 57-51=6. Correct.So, seems like the numbers are 1963 and 51. The smallest is 51.Wait, but let me just verify if there are other possibilities. Because maybe the other number could have been the one with the last two digits struck out. The problem says &quot;strike out the last two digits of one of them&quot;. So, we assumed that we strike out the last two digits of the larger number, but maybe it&#39;s the smaller one. Wait, the smaller number is 51. If we strike out its last two digits, but 51 has only two digits. So, striking out the last two digits would result in 0. Then 0*3=0. Then, 0 should be six more than the other number, which is 2014 -51=1963. So, 0=1963 +6=1969? No, that&#39;s not possible. Therefore, the only possibility is that we have to strike out the last two digits of the larger number, which is 1963, leading to 19, and then 19*3=57=51+6. That works. So, that seems correct.Therefore, the numbers are 51 and 1963, so the smallest is 51. Let me just check my logic again.Let me retrace:We set x as the number from which we strike out last two digits, so x is a number with at least three digits. Then, floor(x /100)=k. Then, 3k = y +6. So, y=3k -6. Then, x + y=2014. So, x=2020 -3k. Also, x=100k +m, where 0 ≤m ≤99. So, 100k +m=2020 -3k. Therefore, 103k +m=2020. Since m is between 0 and 99, 103k ≤2020 ≤103k +99. So, solving for k, we found k=19, m=63. So, x=1963, y=51. Checked. That works. If we tried k=18, then 103*18=1854, m=2020 -1854=166, which is invalid. k=20, 103*20=2060&gt;2020, invalid. Therefore, only k=19 works. Hence, the answer is 51. That seems correct. So, the answer should be 51.Final AnswerThe smallest number is boxed{51}.&lt;/think&gt;Let the two natural numbers be ( x ) and ( y ) such that their sum is 2014, i.e., ( x + y = 2014 ). We assume ( x ) is the number from which we strike out the last two digits. Striking out the last two digits of ( x ) gives ( leftlfloor frac{x}{100} rightrfloor ), which we denote as ( k ). According to the problem, multiplying ( k ) by 3 gives a number that is six more than ( y ). Therefore, we have:[ 3k = y + 6 implies y = 3k - 6 ]Substituting ( y ) in the sum equation:[ x + (3k - 6) = 2014 implies x = 2020 - 3k ]Since ( k ) is obtained by striking out the last two digits of ( x ), we can express ( x ) as ( x = 100k + m ) where ( 0 leq m leq 99 ). Combining this with the earlier expression for ( x ):[ 100k + m = 2020 - 3k implies 103k + m = 2020 ]Given ( 0 leq m leq 99 ), we solve for ( k ):[ 103k leq 2020 leq 103k + 99 ]Calculating the bounds for ( k ):[ frac{2020 - 99}{103} leq k leq frac{2020}{103} ][ 18.65 leq k leq 19.61 ]Since ( k ) must be an integer, the only possible value is ( k = 19 ). Substituting ( k = 19 ):[ 103 times 19 + m = 2020 implies 1957 + m = 2020 implies m = 63 ]Thus, ( x = 100 times 19 + 63 = 1963 ). Substituting ( x ) back into the sum equation:[ y = 2014 - 1963 = 51 ]Verification shows that striking out the last two digits of 1963 gives 19, and ( 3 times 19 = 57 ), which is six more than 51. Therefore, the numbers are 1963 and 51, with the smallest being 51.[boxed{51}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-5286df18></div><p class="review-content" data-v-5286df18><span class="icon" data-v-5286df18>🔑:</span>4.

I have this geometry problem where I need to reconstruct triangle ABC given points A, P, and W. Here&#39;s what I know:- W is the point where the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC again. So, the angle bisector of angle A starts at A, splits angle BAC into two equal parts, and then intersects the circumcircle at W. That makes sense. So, W is the midpoint of the arc BC that doesn&#39;t contain A, right? Wait, actually, the angle bisector of angle A intersects the circumcircle at the midpoint of arc BC. So, if ABC is not isoceles, then W would be the midpoint of arc BC. But maybe that&#39;s only for certain cases. Hmm.- Then there&#39;s another circle s, which has diameter AH, where H is the orthocenter of ABC. This circle s intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. So, the circle with diameter AH passes through H and A, and intersects the circumcircle at another point P. So, points A, P are common to both circles ω and s. The orthocenter H is inside the triangle if ABC is acute, on the triangle if it&#39;s a right triangle, and outside if it&#39;s obtuse. So, the position of H depends on the type of triangle.Given A, P, W, I need to reconstruct triangle ABC. So, starting from points A, P, W, how can I find B and C?Let me think about properties that connect these points. Let me recall some important theorems or lemmas that might be useful here.First, since W is the midpoint of arc BC (assuming it&#39;s the midpoint; maybe I need to confirm that). The angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle again at the midpoint of arc BC. That&#39;s a standard result. So, if we know W, then we know the arc BC is split into two equal arcs by W. So, BW = WC in terms of arc length.Now, the circle s with diameter AH. The orthocenter H has the property that it reflects over the sides to lie on the circumcircle. But perhaps more relevant here is the circle with diameter AH. Any point on this circle s should satisfy the property that the angle subtended by AH is a right angle. So, for any point X on circle s, angle AXH is 90 degrees. Since s intersects ω again at P, then angle APH is 90 degrees. So, PH is perpendicular to AH? Wait, if H is the orthocenter, then AH is the altitude from A to BC, but only if ABC is acute. Wait, no. The orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes. So, in any case, AH is one of the altitudes. So, if the circle with diameter AH is constructed, then any point on this circle will have a right angle at that point viewing the diameter AH. So, for point P, angle APH = 90 degrees. Therefore, PH is perpendicular to AH. Since H is the orthocenter, AH is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, PH is perpendicular to AH, which is itself perpendicular to BC. Therefore, PH is parallel to BC. Wait, is that right?Wait, AH is perpendicular to BC because it&#39;s an altitude. Then if PH is perpendicular to AH, then PH must be parallel to BC, since both are perpendicular to AH. So, PH || BC. That&#39;s an important relation. So, if I can construct BC such that it&#39;s parallel to PH, then maybe I can find BC.But how do I relate this to the given points A, P, W.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, maybe we can use properties related to the symmedian or some reflection properties.Alternatively, since angle APH = 90 degrees, and H lies on the altitude from A, perhaps we can find H first?But since H is the orthocenter, once we have H, we can construct the other altitudes. But given only A, P, W, how can we reconstruct H?Wait, circle s has diameter AH, so its center is the midpoint of AH. If we can find the center of circle s, then since we know point P is on circle s, we can perhaps determine the location of H.But how? Let&#39;s suppose we are working on a coordinate system. Let me assume coordinates to model this problem.Let me try to set up coordinates. Let me place point A at (0,0) for simplicity. Let me assume that the circumcircle ω is centered at some point, but maybe it&#39;s better to use complex numbers or barycentric coordinates. But maybe coordinate geometry can work.Wait, but perhaps synthetic geometry will be better here. Let me think.Given A, P, W. We need to reconstruct ABC. The key points are W, which is the intersection of the angle bisector of A with the circumcircle, and P, which is the second intersection of the circle with diameter AH and the circumcircle.First, let&#39;s note that P lies on both the circumcircle ω and the circle s with diameter AH. Therefore, angle APH is 90 degrees. So, PH is perpendicular to AH. Since AH is an altitude, which is perpendicular to BC, then PH is parallel to BC as previously mentioned.Therefore, BC is parallel to PH. If we can find the line BC, then since W is the midpoint of arc BC, we can perhaps find BC such that W is the midpoint of that arc.But how?Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the line AW is the angle bisector of angle BAC. So, if we can construct BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC lies on some specific location relative to AW.Wait, given that W is on the circumcircle and on the angle bisector, then BC must be such that the angle bisector of angle BAC meets the circumcircle again at W, the midpoint of arc BC.Moreover, PH is parallel to BC. So, if we can find the direction of BC, which is the same as the direction of PH, then perhaps we can find BC.But to find H, since H is the orthocenter, once we have BC, then H can be found as the intersection of the altitudes. But we need to relate H to the given points.Alternatively, since P lies on the circle with diameter AH, then the midpoint of AH is the center of circle s. So, if we can find the center of circle s, which is the midpoint of AH, then since we know point P is on circle s, we can write the equation for circle s.But without coordinates, this might be abstract. Let me try to visualize.Suppose we have points A, P, W on the circumcircle ω. We need to construct BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, and the circle with diameter AH passes through P.Given that PH is parallel to BC, as established earlier, since PH is perpendicular to AH (which is the altitude), and BC is also perpendicular to AH, so PH || BC.Therefore, if we can construct the line PH, then BC is parallel to PH. But PH is a line connecting P and H. But we don&#39;t know H yet.But H is the orthocenter. If we can express H in terms of ABC, but we don&#39;t have ABC yet. Hmm.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the midpoint of arc BC is equidistant from B and C, and the angle bisector of angle BAC passes through W.Also, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the line W to the midpoint of BC is perpendicular to the angle bisector? Not sure.Wait, another property: The midpoint of arc BC (which is W) is the center of the circle tangent to AB, AC, and the circumcircle. Maybe that&#39;s too complicated.Alternatively, reflection properties. Reflecting the orthocenter H over the sides BC, AC, AB gives points on the circumcircle. For example, reflecting H over BC gives a point on the circumcircle. Similarly, reflecting over AB or AC also gives points on the circumcircle. Maybe this can help.But perhaps we need another approach. Let me try to reconstruct the triangle step by step.Given A, P, W on ω. Let me consider the following steps:1. Since W is on the angle bisector of angle BAC and is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC must be such that W is the midpoint of that arc. Therefore, BC is the chord of ω such that W is the midpoint of arc BAC. Wait, no. The angle bisector of angle BAC meets ω again at W, which is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A. Wait, if ABC is a triangle, the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle again at the midpoint of arc BC that doesn&#39;t contain A. So, if ABC is acute, then the arc BC not containing A is the one opposite to A. So, W is the midpoint of that arc.2. The circle s with diameter AH passes through P. Therefore, P lies on both ω and s. Therefore, AP is a chord common to both circles. Since s is defined as the circle with diameter AH, which is the altitude from A to BC. So, AH is perpendicular to BC, and H lies on BC if the triangle is right-angled, but otherwise inside or outside.3. Since angle APH is 90 degrees (because P lies on circle s with diameter AH), PH is perpendicular to AH. Therefore, PH is parallel to BC, as AH is perpendicular to both PH and BC.Therefore, direction of BC is same as direction of PH.So, if we can find the direction of PH, we can get the direction of BC.But H is unknown. H is the orthocenter. How can we relate H to the given points?Alternatively, since H is the orthocenter, then H lies on the altitude from A, which is line AH. Also, H must lie on the other two altitudes. But since we don&#39;t have the other vertices, maybe this is not helpful.Wait, but perhaps we can express H in terms of A, P, and W. Let me think.Since PH is parallel to BC, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, perhaps there is a reflection or symmetry here.Alternatively, consider the following: Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the line AW is the angle bisector. If I can construct BC such that when I draw the altitude from A to BC (which is AH), then PH is parallel to BC.But how to connect these?Alternatively, since PH is parallel to BC, the direction of BC is determined by PH. So, if we can construct BC parallel to PH, passing through some point. But where?Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the line BC is the polar of W with respect to the circumcircle ω. Wait, polar? Maybe that&#39;s too complex.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the tangents from W to ω touch at points B and C. Wait, no, that&#39;s only if W is the ex point or something. Wait, no. If W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the tangent at W is parallel to BC. Wait, is that true?Yes, actually, the tangent at the midpoint of an arc is parallel to the chord subtended by that arc. For example, the tangent at W (midpoint of arc BC) is parallel to BC. That&#39;s a standard result. So, the tangent to ω at W is parallel to BC.Since PH is also parallel to BC, then the tangent at W is parallel to PH. Therefore, the tangent at W is parallel to PH.Therefore, if we construct the tangent line at W to ω, that line is parallel to PH. Therefore, the direction of PH is the same as the tangent at W.Wait, tangent at W is parallel to BC, and PH is parallel to BC, so tangent at W is parallel to PH. Therefore, the tangent at W is parallel to PH. So, if I can construct the tangent at W, then that gives the direction of PH. But since PH is a segment from P to H, which we don&#39;t know yet.Alternatively, since the tangent at W is parallel to PH, the direction of PH is the same as the tangent at W.But we know point P, so if we can find the tangent at W, then we can find the direction of PH. Then, since H lies on AH (the altitude from A), which is the same line as the angle bisector (since AW is the angle bisector and also the line containing the altitude AH if and only if ABC is isoceles?). Wait, no. The angle bisector of angle A is AW, but AH is the altitude. In general, these are different lines unless ABC is isoceles with AB=AC.So, unless ABC is isoceles, AW and AH are different lines. Therefore, H is on the altitude from A, which is different from the angle bisector AW. Therefore, H is somewhere on the line perpendicular to BC, passing through A. Wait, no. The altitude from A is the line from A to H, which is perpendicular to BC. So, AH is perpendicular to BC. The angle bisector is AW. These two lines (AH and AW) are different unless ABC is isoceles.Therefore, H is on the line AH, which is perpendicular to BC. But we don&#39;t know where H is on that line.Wait, but we do know that H is the orthocenter. So, once BC is constructed, H is the intersection of the three altitudes. But since we only have A, reconstructing BC would allow us to find H.But how?Alternatively, since circle s has diameter AH, and passes through P, then the center of circle s is the midpoint of AH. Let&#39;s denote the midpoint as M. Then, since P lies on s, the distance from M to P is equal to the radius, which is half of AH. So, if we can construct M such that MP = MA = MH, but since M is the midpoint, MA = MH. Wait, no. If M is the midpoint of AH, then MA = MH, and the radius of circle s is MA = MH. So, the circle s has center M and radius MA.Therefore, since P is on circle s, the distance from M to P must be equal to MA. So, if we can find M such that M is the midpoint of AH, and MP = MA, then we can find H.But how?Alternatively, since we know A and P, we can write that for any point H, the midpoint M of AH must satisfy that MP = MA. So, given A and P, the set of possible midpoints M lie on the perpendicular bisector of AP. Wait, is that true?Let me think. For any point H, the midpoint M of AH must satisfy that M is such that MP = MA. So, MP = MA. So, the locus of points M where MP = MA is the perpendicular bisector of segment AP. Because the set of points equidistant from A and P is the perpendicular bisector of AP. Therefore, M must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AP, and also M must be the midpoint of AH for some H.Therefore, to find H, we can take a point M on the perpendicular bisector of AP, then H is the reflection of A over M. Then, once H is determined, we can check if PH is parallel to BC, which is constructed using W.But this seems a bit abstract. Let me try to formalize it.Given A, P, W on ω:1. The midpoint M of AH must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AP because MP = MA.2. H is the reflection of A over M: H = 2M - A.3. BC is parallel to PH.4. W is the midpoint of arc BC of ω.So, the steps could be:- Find the perpendicular bisector of AP. All possible midpoints M lie on this line.- For each M on this perpendicular bisector, compute H = 2M - A.- Then, construct line PH, which should be parallel to BC.- Since BC is a chord of ω such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, and BC is parallel to PH, we can find BC as the chord parallel to PH passing through some point related to W.But how to connect BC with W?Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC is the chord such that the tangent at W is parallel to BC. Also, we established that BC is parallel to PH. Therefore, the tangent at W is parallel to PH.Therefore, if we construct the tangent at W to ω, then PH must be parallel to this tangent. But PH is already a given segment from P to H, which is determined by H. But H depends on M, which is on the perpendicular bisector of AP. So, perhaps this gives us a condition to select the correct M.Therefore, the tangent at W is parallel to PH. Therefore, the direction of PH must be the same as the tangent at W. So, given that, once we construct H such that PH is parallel to the tangent at W, then we can find BC as the chord parallel to PH, with midpoint of arc BC at W.Therefore, combining these two conditions:1. M lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP.2. PH is parallel to the tangent at W.But how to enforce these?Let me try to formalize this.Let’s denote the tangent at W to ω as t_W. Since t_W is parallel to PH, the direction of PH is the same as t_W. Therefore, the line PH must be parallel to t_W. So, given points P and H, the line PH must be parallel to t_W. But H is determined by M, which is a midpoint of AH. Therefore, if we can find such an M on the perpendicular bisector of AP such that PH (from P to H = 2M - A) is parallel to t_W.Therefore, this is a system of equations:- M is the midpoint of AH =&gt; H = 2M - A.- M lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP.- The line PH is parallel to the tangent t_W at W.Therefore, this should uniquely determine M, and thus H.Once H is determined, then since BC is parallel to PH, and BC is a chord of ω with midpoint of arc BC at W, then BC can be constructed as follows:The chord BC such that it is parallel to PH and the midpoint of arc BC is W. Since the midpoint of arc BC is W, the direction of BC must be such that the tangent at W is parallel to BC. But the tangent at W is already parallel to PH, so BC is parallel to PH. Therefore, BC is the chord through some point, parallel to PH, such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.But how to find the specific chord BC? Since ω is given (as the circumcircle through A, B, C, but we only have points A, P, W on it), but without knowing B and C, we need another condition.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH and passes through the point which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. Wait, no. Wait, W is the midpoint of arc BC. Therefore, the midpoint of arc BC is W, so the tangents from W to ω meet at W. Wait, no, the tangent at W is the line that touches ω only at W.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the line BC is the polar of W with respect to ω. Wait, the polar of a point with respect to a circle is the line such that the point is the pole, and the line is the polar. The polar of W would be the line BC if W is the midpoint of arc BC. Is that a standard result?Wait, the polar of a point on the circumcircle is the tangent at that point. Wait, no. Wait, the polar of a point with respect to a circle is defined as the set of points whose reciprocals lie on the circle. For a point on the circle, its polar is the tangent at that point. So, the polar of W is the tangent at W. But BC is a chord of the circle. So, the pole of BC would be the intersection point of the tangents at B and C. But since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the tangents at B and C meet at some point, which is the exsimilicenter or something. Not sure.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, and we need to find BC on ω such that W is the midpoint of arc BC. So, given the direction of BC (parallel to PH), and the fact that W is the midpoint of arc BC, we can find BC.How?If we have a direction for BC (parallel to PH), then there should be a unique chord in ω with that direction such that W is the midpoint of the corresponding arc.Therefore, given that, once we have PH, we can find BC as the chord of ω with direction parallel to PH and such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.Therefore, the steps are:1. Find the tangent line at W to ω. Let’s call this line t_W.2. Since t_W is parallel to BC and PH, then PH must be parallel to t_W.3. Therefore, PH is parallel to t_W. So, the line PH must have the same slope as t_W.4. Given that, we can determine H such that PH is parallel to t_W, and H lies on the altitude from A (which is the line through A perpendicular to BC, which is the same as the line through A perpendicular to t_W).But wait, since BC is parallel to t_W, then BC is parallel to PH and t_W. Therefore, AH is perpendicular to BC, so AH is perpendicular to t_W as well.Therefore, AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.Therefore, the altitude AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W. Therefore, once we know t_W, we can find the direction of AH.But since t_W is the tangent at W, we can compute its direction. For example, in coordinate geometry, the tangent at W can be found if we know the coordinates of W and the center of ω.But since ω is the circumcircle of ABC, which we are supposed to reconstruct, but we are only given A, P, W. Wait, but A, P, W are points on ω. So, the circumcircle ω is determined by these three points? Wait, three points determine a circle unless they are colinear. Since A, P, W are on the circumcircle of ABC, but unless they are colinear, which they aren&#39;t in a triangle, ω is uniquely determined by A, P, W. Therefore, ω is known, as the circle passing through A, P, W. Therefore, we can construct ω given A, P, W. So, perhaps the problem is in the plane, and we need to reconstruct ABC with A, P, W given as points in the plane, with ω being their circumcircle.But the problem states &quot;Restore the triangle ABC if the points A, P, W are given.&quot; So, presumably, A, P, W are given in the plane, and we know that W is the intersection of the angle bisector of A with ω, and P is the second intersection of the circle with diameter AH and ω.Therefore, given A, P, W, reconstruct ABC.So, assuming that we have coordinate geometry tools, let&#39;s suppose we can compute coordinates.Let me outline a possible construction:1. Given A, P, W.2. Construct the circumcircle ω through A, P, W. (Though if three points are given, the circle is determined.)3. Find the tangent t_W to ω at W.4. The line BC will be parallel to t_W, since the tangent at W is parallel to BC.5. Therefore, BC is parallel to t_W.6. The altitude AH is perpendicular to t_W, so AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.7. Therefore, the orthocenter H lies on line AH (perpendicular to t_W).8. The circle s with diameter AH must pass through P. Therefore, since H is on AH, and s has diameter AH, then P lies on s. Therefore, H is determined such that angle APH = 90 degrees.But wait, H is the orthocenter. So, given that H is on AH (perpendicular to t_W), and that angle APH = 90 degrees, which is equivalent to P lying on s, we can find H.Specifically, since s has diameter AH, and P lies on s, then H must be the orthocenter such that P lies on s. Therefore, once we have AH as the line perpendicular to t_W through A, then H is the point on AH such that the circle with diameter AH passes through P.Therefore, to find H, we can construct the circle s with diameter AH (where AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W), and find its intersection with ω. One intersection is A, the other is P. Therefore, given that P is already on ω, H must be such that when we draw the circle with diameter AH, P lies on it. Therefore, given that, H is uniquely determined.Wait, but how?Given line AH (perpendicular to t_W), then H is a point on AH such that P lies on the circle with diameter AH. Therefore, H is the intersection of AH with the circle with center at the midpoint of AH and radius AH/2, passing through P. Wait, but how do we find H?Wait, since P lies on both ω and s, s is the circle with diameter AH. So, if we construct the circle s with diameter AH, then P must lie on s. Therefore, given that, once AH is determined (as the line through A perpendicular to t_W), then H is the point on AH such that P lies on the circle with diameter AH.Therefore, H is the intersection point of AH and the circle with diameter AP such that... Wait, no.Wait, the circle s has diameter AH. So, the set of points H on line AH such that P lies on s is determined by the condition that angle APH = 90 degrees. So, the locus of H such that angle APH = 90 degrees is the circle with diameter AP. Wait, no. The locus of points H such that angle APH = 90 degrees is the circle with diameter AP. But H is constrained to lie on line AH. Therefore, the intersection of line AH with the circle with diameter AP gives H.Wait, this is getting confusing. Let&#39;s try again.If angle APH is 90 degrees, then H lies on the circle with diameter AP. But also, H lies on the line AH (the altitude). Therefore, H is the intersection of line AH (perpendicular to t_W) and the circle with diameter AP.Therefore, given that:1. Line AH is constructed as the line through A perpendicular to tangent t_W at W.2. Then, H is the intersection of line AH and the circle with diameter AP.Therefore, once we construct line AH and the circle with diameter AP, their intersection point is H.But there can be two intersection points: A and another point. Since H is not A, it&#39;s the other intersection.Therefore, this gives us H.Once H is found, then since BC is parallel to t_W, and BC is a chord of ω, passing through... Wait, BC is parallel to t_W, but how to find its exact position?But since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC is the chord such that W is the midpoint of arc BC. So, given that, and that BC is parallel to t_W, we can construct BC as follows:The chord BC parallel to t_W such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.But how?Wait, for a given circle ω, and a direction (parallel to t_W), there is exactly one chord BC in that direction such that W is the midpoint of the corresponding arc.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the line OW (where O is the center of ω) is perpendicular to BC and bisects BC. Therefore, if we can find the line BC parallel to t_W, then OW is perpendicular to BC, hence OW is perpendicular to t_W.Wait, but t_W is the tangent at W, so OW is the radius, and the tangent at W is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, t_W is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is parallel to t_W, and OW is perpendicular to t_W. Therefore, OW is perpendicular to BC as well, which is consistent, since OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC.Therefore, the line OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC, and OW is also the line from the center to W, which is perpendicular to t_W.Therefore, BC is a chord of ω, parallel to t_W, whose perpendicular bisector is OW. Therefore, BC is the chord perpendicular to OW at the midpoint of BC. Wait, but BC is parallel to t_W, which is perpendicular to OW, so BC is parallel to t_W, which is perpendicular to OW, so BC is perpendicular to OW? Wait, no.Wait, tangent t_W is perpendicular to OW, since OW is the radius at W. So, t_W is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, if BC is parallel to t_W, then BC is also perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is a chord of ω perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is the chord passing through the point which is the intersection of OW and BC. But OW is the line from the center to W, and BC is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is the chord passing through the midpoint of OW? Wait, no.Wait, if BC is perpendicular to OW, then the line OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, the midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and OW is perpendicular to BC.But since BC is parallel to t_W, which is perpendicular to OW, then BC is also perpendicular to OW. Therefore, OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, the midpoint of BC lies on OW, and OW is perpendicular to BC.Therefore, to construct BC:1. Find the center O of ω (since ω is determined by A, P, W).2. Draw the line OW.3. The midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW.But BC is also parallel to t_W. But t_W is the tangent at W, which is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is parallel to t_W, which is perpendicular to OW, so BC is perpendicular to OW, which matches the previous conclusion.Therefore, BC is the chord perpendicular to OW, passing through its midpoint M on OW. Wait, no. Since OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC, then the midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW.But how to find M?Since BC is a chord perpendicular to OW, passing through some point M on OW. To determine M, note that W is the midpoint of arc BC. Therefore, the arc BC is 180 degrees? No, only if BC is a diameter, which it isn&#39;t unless ABC is a right triangle.Wait, but W is the midpoint of arc BC, which means that arc BWC is equal to arc BAC. Wait, depending on the triangle.Alternatively, the midpoint of arc BC (not containing A) is W, so the measure of arc BW is equal to arc WC.Therefore, the central angles for arcs BW and WC are equal. Therefore, angle BOW = angle WOC, where O is the center.Therefore, OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC.But since BC is perpendicular to OW, then triangle BOC is isoceles with OW as the axis of symmetry.Therefore, OW is the perpendicular bisector of BC. So, in any case, BC is the chord perpendicular to OW at its midpoint M.Therefore, once we know O, we can find BC as the chord through M, perpendicular to OW, where M is the midpoint of BC. But how to find M?But since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the midpoint M of BC can be found by the intersection of BC and OW. But we need another relation.Alternatively, the distance from O to BC is equal to the distance from O to M, since M is the midpoint. Since BC is perpendicular to OW, which is the line OM. Therefore, the length of OM is equal to the distance from O to BC.But how does this help?Alternatively, since W is on the circumcircle and is the midpoint of arc BC, the distance from W to BC is equal to the distance from W to AB or AC. Not sure.Alternatively, use power of point. The power of W with respect to BC. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, since we can construct BC once we have its direction (perpendicular to OW) and knowing that W is the midpoint of arc BC. So, perhaps the chord BC is the unique chord perpendicular to OW such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.But how?Alternatively, if we reflect O over BC, the reflection lies on the circumcircle. Wait, reflecting O over BC gives the point opposite to the arc BC. Wait, no. Reflecting the center over a chord gives the point on the other end of the diameter perpendicular to the chord. But BC is perpendicular to OW, so reflecting O over BC would give a point along the line OW. Wait, if BC is perpendicular to OW, then reflecting O over BC would be a point on the line OW, on the other side of BC.But perhaps this is too vague.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then WB = WC. So, in terms of distances, WB = WC. So, if we can construct BC such that W is equidistant from B and C, and BC is perpendicular to OW.Wait, but WB and WC are arcs, not straight-line distances. Hmm.Alternatively, in triangle WBC, WB = WC as arcs, so the chord lengths WB and WC are equal. Therefore, WB = WC as chords.Therefore, if we construct BC such that WB = WC and BC is perpendicular to OW, then that gives the unique chord BC.But how?Given that, once we have OW, which is a known line (from center O to point W), and BC is perpendicular to OW, we can construct BC as follows:1. Find point M on OW such that WM is the midpoint of arc BC. Wait, but we need a different condition.Alternatively, since WB = WC, and BC is perpendicular to OW, then triangles WBO and WCO are congruent. Therefore, angles WBO and WCO are equal. Therefore, WB = WC as chords.But I&#39;m stuck here. Let me think differently.Suppose we have the center O of ω. Then, since BC is perpendicular to OW, we can find BC by rotating OW 90 degrees. Wait, not necessarily.Alternatively, construct the line BC perpendicular to OW, passing through some point M on OW. Then, W is the midpoint of arc BC. Therefore, the arc from B to W to C is 180 degrees. Wait, no. The measure of arc BW is equal to arc WC. So, if the entire arc BC is, say, θ degrees, then arc BW and WC are each θ/2 degrees. But since W is the midpoint.But how does this help in constructing BC?Alternatively, if I can compute the angle subtended by BC at the center O. Since BC is perpendicular to OW, the angle between BC and OW is 90 degrees. So, the angle between OW and BC is 90 degrees.Wait, but OW is a radius, and BC is a chord perpendicular to OW. Therefore, OW bisects BC. So, the midpoint M of BC is the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC.Therefore, M is the foot of O on BC, which lies on OW.Therefore, M is the intersection point of OW and BC, and since BC is perpendicular to OW at M, then M is the midpoint of BC.Therefore, once we know M, we can construct BC as the line perpendicular to OW at M.But how do we find M?Given that W is the midpoint of arc BC, the central angles for arcs BW and WC are equal. Let’s denote the central angle for arc BW as α, so arc WC is also α, and arc BAC is 2π - 2α. But not sure.Alternatively, the central angle for arc BW is equal to angle BOW, which is equal to angle WOC. Therefore, angle BOW = angle WOC = α.Since OW is the bisector of angle BOC.But BC is perpendicular to OW. In triangle OBC, which is isoceles with OB=OC, the altitude from O is OW. Wait, no. If BC is perpendicular to OW, then in triangle OBC, which is isoceles (OB=OC), the altitude from O to BC is OW. Therefore, OW is the altitude of triangle OBC. Therefore, since in an isoceles triangle, the altitude from the apex is also the median and the angle bisector. Therefore, OW is the median, angle bisector, and altitude of triangle OBC. Therefore, M is the foot of the altitude, which is the midpoint of BC.Therefore, in triangle OBC, with OB=OC, altitude OW, then BM=MC, angle BOW=angle WOC.But how does this help us find M?Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the central angle for arc BW is equal to arc WC. Let’s denote the central angle for arc BW as θ. Therefore, angle BOW = angle WOC = θ. Then, the central angle for arc BC is 2θ.But since BC is a chord of ω, the length of BC is 2R sin θ, where R is the radius of ω.But without knowing θ, this doesn&#39;t help directly.Wait, but we can relate θ to the position of M.Since in triangle OBC, which is isoceles with OB=OC=R, and altitude OW (which is length h), then the distance from O to BC is h = OW * cos φ, where φ is the angle between OW and OM. Wait, this is getting too vague.Alternatively, since we know O and W, then OW is a known segment. Let&#39;s denote the length of OW as d. Since BC is perpendicular to OW at M, the midpoint of BC. Then, in the right triangle OMB, we have:OM^2 + MB^2 = OB^2.But OB is the radius R of ω, OM is the distance from O to M, which is |OM|, and MB is half the length of BC.But we don&#39;t know |OM|.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the angle subtended by arc BC at O is 2θ, then the length of arc BW is θ.But without more information, this might not be helpful.Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the midpoint of BC is M, which lies on OW, and that the reflection of O over M is the point diametrically opposite to W. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the reflection of O over the line BC is the point W&#39;. Wait, the reflection of the center over the chord BC lies on the opposite arc. Wait, maybe. The reflection of O over BC is a point W&#39; such that OW&#39; is perpendicular to BC and twice the distance from O to BC. But since BC is perpendicular to OW, then the reflection of O over BC would lie on the line OW.Wait, yes. Since BC is perpendicular to OW at M, then reflecting O over BC would be a point O&#39; such that O&#39; lies on OW, on the opposite side of BC from O, at distance 2*OM from O.Therefore, O&#39; is the reflection of O over BC, then O&#39; lies on OW, and O&#39;O is perpendicular to BC, with OM = MO&#39;.But W is the midpoint of arc BC. How is W related to O&#39;?Alternatively, the reflection of O over BC is O&#39;, then BO&#39;C is congruent to BOC, but reflected. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, which is not containing O&#39;, maybe.Alternatively, this might not be helpful.Perhaps I need to use the fact that once we have H, then we can find BC as the line through the foot of the altitude from H to BC, but this seems recursive.Alternatively, given that BC is parallel to PH, which we can construct once we have H. So, after constructing H, then BC is the line parallel to PH passing through the foot of the altitude from A, which is the same as H&#39;s foot on BC.Wait, but H is the orthocenter, so the foot of the altitude from A to BC is the same as the foot D of AH on BC. Since AH is perpendicular to BC, D is the foot.But since BC is parallel to PH, and H is above BC (assuming acute triangle), then the line PH is parallel to BC and offset by some distance.But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, and we know that H is the orthocenter, then BH is perpendicular to AC, and CH is perpendicular to AB. So, if we can find lines BH and CH such that they are perpendicular to AC and AB respectively, but without knowing B and C, this seems difficult.Wait, perhaps another approach.Let me recap the steps:1. Given points A, P, W on the circumcircle ω.2. The tangent at W to ω is t_W.3. The altitude AH is perpendicular to t_W, so AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.4. The orthocenter H is the intersection of AH and the circle with diameter AP (since angle APH = 90 degrees).Wait, earlier, we thought that H is on AH and angle APH = 90 degrees. Therefore, H lies on the intersection of AH and the circle with diameter AP.But the circle with diameter AP is different from the circle with diameter AH. Wait, maybe confusion here.Wait, since P lies on circle s with diameter AH, then angle APH = 90 degrees. Therefore, H lies on the circle with diameter AP. Wait, no. If angle APH = 90 degrees, then P lies on the circle with diameter AH. Therefore, circle s with diameter AH passes through P. Therefore, given AH, circle s has diameter AH and passes through P. Therefore, given A and P, the circle s is defined as the circle with diameter AH, which must pass through P. Therefore, H is determined such that H lies on AH (perpendicular to t_W) and PH is perpendicular to AH.Wait, perhaps my confusion is arising from mixing different circles.Let me clarify:- Circle s has diameter AH. Therefore, any point on s satisfies that the angle subtended by AH is 90 degrees. Therefore, for point P on s, angle APH = 90 degrees.- Given that, and knowing that AH is the altitude from A (perpendicular to BC), which is also perpendicular to PH (since angle APH = 90 degrees), we concluded that PH is parallel to BC.Therefore, once we have H, then BC is parallel to PH. Therefore, BC can be constructed as the line through some point, parallel to PH.But which point? BC must be a chord of ω passing through some point. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, BC is the chord such that W is the midpoint of its arc. So, perhaps BC can be constructed by rotating PH around the center until W becomes the midpoint of arc BC.But how?Alternatively, given that BC is parallel to PH, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC is the unique chord parallel to PH such that W is the midpoint of the corresponding arc.Therefore, once PH is determined, then BC is determined as the chord parallel to PH with W as the midpoint of arc BC.Therefore, the construction steps could be:1. Given A, P, W on ω.2. Construct the tangent t_W to ω at W.3. Construct line AH as the line through A perpendicular to t_W.4. Construct the circle s with diameter AH.5. Find H as the intersection point of line AH and circle s (other than A).6. Construct line PH.7. BC is the chord of ω parallel to PH such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.8. The intersection points of BC with ω are points B and C.Once B and C are found, triangle ABC is reconstructed.But how to implement step 7? Given that BC is parallel to PH and W is the midpoint of arc BC.Let me think of this in terms of angles.Since BC is parallel to PH, the angle between BC and any tangent is the same as the angle between PH and that tangent. But since BC is a chord of ω, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, the tangent at W is parallel to BC, hence parallel to PH.Therefore, once we have the direction of PH (parallel to BC), and the knowledge that W is the midpoint of arc BC, we can rotate the line PH around the center O until W becomes the midpoint of the arc.But this is vague.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, then BC can be obtained by translating PH such that it becomes a chord of ω with W as the midpoint of arc BC.But translation won&#39;t work because BC must pass through certain points.Alternatively, parametrize the possible chords parallel to PH and find the one for which W is the midpoint of arc BC.Given that ω is known, and the direction of BC is known (parallel to PH), there should be two such chords: one corresponding to the arc BC containing W and one not. But since W is the midpoint of arc BC, it depends on which arc we take.But in the problem statement, W is the midpoint of arc BC, which is met by the angle bisector of angle A. So, depending on the triangle, it&#39;s the midpoint of the arc BC that doesn&#39;t contain A.Wait, yes. In a triangle, the angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle again at the midpoint of arc BC that does not contain A. Therefore, W is the midpoint of arc BC opposite to A.Therefore, given that, and BC parallel to PH, we need to construct the chord BC parallel to PH such that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.Therefore, to find BC, we can perform the following:1. Find all chords of ω parallel to PH.2. Among those chords, find the one where W is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A.Since there are two arcs BC for each chord: the one containing A and the one not containing A. We need the one not containing A, and W is its midpoint.To find this chord, we can use the following approach:Since W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A, the line AW is the angle bisector of angle BAC. Therefore, AW is the angle bisector, and W lies on the circumcircle.Given that, and the fact that BC is parallel to PH, we can use the following method:1. Find the center O of ω.2. The line OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC (since W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A).3. Since BC is parallel to PH, and OW is the angle bisector, then BC is perpendicular to OW.Wait, earlier we established that BC is perpendicular to OW because BC is parallel to the tangent at W, which is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, BC is the chord passing through the midpoint M of BC, which lies on OW, and is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, once we know OW, we can find M as the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC, but BC is itself perpendicular to OW. Therefore, M is the foot of O on BC, which lies on OW.But how to find M?Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, and PH is known once H is constructed, then BC is a translation of PH to a chord of ω such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.But how?Wait, perhaps the key is that BC is the image of PH under a certain translation or rotation that maps PH to a chord of ω with W as the midpoint of arc BC.But this is too vague. Maybe a better approach is needed.Let me try to outline the steps with a hypothetical coordinate system.Assume coordinate system:1. Let’s set point A at (0,0).2. Let’s assume the circumcircle ω has center at (h,k) and radius R.But since three points A, P, W are on ω, we can determine ω&#39;s equation. But since this is synthetic geometry, coordinate approach might not be the best.Alternatively, use inversion or other methods. But perhaps this is overcomplicating.Wait, the problem is to restore the triangle ABC given A, P, W. So, in a real Olympiad problem, the solution would likely involve a clever construction using the given points and properties of the orthocenter, angle bisectors, and circles.Let me think of the following possible construction:1. Given points A, P, W.2. Construct the circumcircle ω of APW.3. Construct the tangent t_W to ω at W.4. Construct the line AH perpendicular to t_W through A.5. Construct the circle s with diameter AH.6. Find the other intersection point of s and ω, which is P (given). But we need to find H.Wait, H is the orthocenter, which is on AH. And P lies on both ω and s. Therefore, H is such that circle s with diameter AH passes through P. Therefore, H is the second intersection point of line AH with the circle with diameter AP. Wait, why?Because if we consider circle with diameter AP, then any point H on this circle satisfies angle AHP = 90 degrees. But we need angle APH = 90 degrees. Wait, no. If s has diameter AH, then P lies on s, so angle APH = 90 degrees.Therefore, H must lie on AH such that P lies on s. Therefore, H is the second intersection point (other than A) of line AH and the circle with diameter AP. Wait, no, the circle s has diameter AH, not AP.Wait, if we define s as the circle with diameter AH, then P is on s, so the circle s is determined by A and H. Therefore, given A and P, we can find H such that s passes through P.Therefore, the center of s is the midpoint M of AH, and radius is MA = MH. Since P lies on s, MP = MA. Therefore, M is equidistant from A and P, so M lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP.Therefore, midpoint M of AH lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP. Therefore, AH is a line through A such that its midpoint M is on the perpendicular bisector of AP.Therefore, given that, and that AH is perpendicular to t_W, we can determine AH.So, steps:1. Given A, P, W.2. Construct ω (circumcircle of A, P, W).3. Construct tangent t_W at W to ω.4. AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.5. The midpoint M of AH lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP.6. Therefore, find M as the intersection of AH and the perpendicular bisector of AP.7. Then, H is the reflection of A over M.8. Once H is found, construct line PH.9. BC is the chord of ω parallel to PH such that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.But how to construct BC parallel to PH?Since BC is parallel to PH, and W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A, which means that BC is the chord for which W is the midpoint of its arc opposite to A.Therefore, given that direction, we can construct BC as follows:1. The line BC is parallel to PH.2. W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.Therefore, since BC is parallel to PH, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, we need to find the chord BC in ω with direction parallel to PH such that W is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A.This is a unique chord, so there should be a way to construct it.One method is:1. Find the center O of ω.2. The line OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC (since W is the midpoint of arc BC).3. Since BC is parallel to PH, which is parallel to the tangent t_W, and t_W is perpendicular to OW, then BC is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, BC is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, BC is the chord of ω passing through the midpoint M of BC, which lies on OW, and is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, to construct BC:1. Find O, the center of ω.2. Draw line OW.3. BC is the chord of ω perpendicular to OW at its midpoint M.But how to find M?The midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW at M.Therefore, M is the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC, but BC is perpendicular to OW, so M is the foot of OW onto BC.Wait, but OW is a radius, and BC is a chord perpendicular to OW at M. Therefore, OM is the distance from the center to the chord BC.Given that, in a circle, the distance from the center to a chord is given by d = OM = R cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the radius and the chord.But without knowing theta, this is not helpful.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, and PH can be constructed once H is known, then BC is uniquely determined by its direction and the condition that W is the midpoint of arc BC.Therefore, given that, once we have the direction of BC (parallel to PH), we can rotate the line PH around the circle until W becomes the midpoint of arc BC.But this is vague.Alternatively, consider that since BC is parallel to PH, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, we can find M as the intersection of OW and the line parallel to PH through some point.But since BC is parallel to PH, and we need it to be perpendicular to OW, then PH must be perpendicular to OW. Therefore, the direction of PH is the same as the direction perpendicular to OW.But wait, since BC is parallel to PH and BC is perpendicular to OW, then PH is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, the line PH is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, this gives us a condition: line PH must be perpendicular to OW.Therefore, given points P and H, the line PH must be perpendicular to OW.But OW is the line from the center O of ω to W. Therefore, PH is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, combining this with previous conditions:1. H lies on AH, which is perpendicular to tangent t_W at W.2. PH is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, this gives two conditions to determine H.Therefore, the steps would be:1. Find the center O of ω.2. Find the tangent t_W at W.3. AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.4. Find H as the point on AH such that PH is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, once H is found, BC can be constructed as the line through the foot of the perpendicular from H to BC (which is the orthocenter condition), but this is getting too recursive.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH and perpendicular to OW, then BC is the line through some point, parallel to PH, and perpendicular to OW. Therefore, once PH is known, BC is determined.But how to find the position?Given that BC must be a chord of ω, parallel to PH, and perpendicular to OW. Therefore, the line BC is the line parallel to PH and perpendicular to OW, and intersecting ω at points B and C.But how to construct such a line?This seems to be a standard chord construction: find the chord of ω with a given direction (parallel to PH) and perpendicular to OW. This should be unique.Therefore, steps:1. Given points A, P, W.2. Construct ω.3. Find O, the center of ω.4. Construct tangent t_W at W.5. AH is the line through A perpendicular to t_W.6. Find H on AH such that PH is perpendicular to OW.7. Once H is found, construct BC as the chord of ω parallel to PH.8. The intersection points of BC with ω are B and C.This seems plausible. Now, how to implement step 6: Find H on AH such that PH is perpendicular to OW.Since O and W are known, OW is a known line. The direction of OW is known. Therefore, PH must be perpendicular to OW.Therefore, H must be such that line PH is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, given point P, and line AH, we need to find H on AH such that line PH is perpendicular to OW.This is a standard locus problem. The set of points H on AH such that PH is perpendicular to OW is the intersection of AH and the locus of points H such that PH perpendicular to OW.The locus of points H such that PH perpendicular to OW is a line. Therefore, H is the intersection of AH and this line.Therefore, to find H:1. Construct line l perpendicular to OW through P.2. Find the intersection of line l with line AH. This is H.Therefore, step-by-step:1. Given A, P, W.2. Construct ω (circle through A, P, W).3. Find O, the center of ω.4. Construct tangent t_W at W.5. Construct AH as the line through A perpendicular to t_W.6. Construct line OW.7. Construct line l through P perpendicular to OW.8. Find H as the intersection of AH and l.9. Once H is found, construct line PH.10. Construct BC as the line parallel to PH through... Wait, BC is parallel to PH, but where?Wait, BC is a chord of ω parallel to PH. So, we need to construct a line parallel to PH that is a chord of ω. But there are infinitely many such chords. But we need the specific chord for which W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.But since BC is parallel to PH and also must satisfy that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A, which is equivalent to BC being perpendicular to OW.But earlier, we established that BC is perpendicular to OW.Therefore, BC is the line parallel to PH and perpendicular to OW. Since PH is perpendicular to OW (from step 7, line l is perpendicular to OW), and BC is parallel to PH, then BC is also perpendicular to OW.Therefore, BC is the line perpendicular to OW, parallel to PH, passing through some point.But since BC is a chord of ω, and perpendicular to OW, then BC is the chord passing through the midpoint M of BC, which lies on OW.Therefore, BC is the unique chord of ω perpendicular to OW. Therefore, there is only one such chord.Therefore, once we have the direction of BC (perpendicular to OW), BC is uniquely determined.But wait, direction perpendicular to OW and passing through the midpoint M on OW.Therefore, to construct BC:1. Find the midpoint M of OW.Wait, no. The midpoint M of BC lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW at M.But since BC is a chord perpendicular to OW, M is the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC. But BC is perpendicular to OW, so M lies on OW.Therefore, BC is the unique chord of ω perpendicular to OW at M.But how to find M?The length from O to M can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let’s denote R as the radius of ω, then OM^2 + MB^2 = OB^2 = R^2.But without knowing MB, this is still two variables.But since W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A, the central angle for arc BW is equal to arc WC. Let’s denote angle BOW = angle WOC = θ.Since BC is perpendicular to OW at M, then angle BOM = 90 degrees. Wait, no. If BC is perpendicular to OW at M, then angle OMB = 90 degrees.Wait, this is getting too involved.Perhaps the key insight is that once H is found, BC can be constructed as the line through the orthocenter H&#39;s foot on BC, but this is circular.Wait, no. Once we have H, the orthocenter, we can find the other altitudes.But how?Alternatively, since H is the orthocenter, the other altitudes BH and CH can be constructed. But without B and C, this is not helpful.Alternatively, since BC is parallel to PH, once we have BC, we can find B and C as the intersections of BC with ω.Therefore, putting it all together:1. Given A, P, W.2. Find the circumcircle ω of A, P, W.3. Determine the center O of ω.4. Construct the tangent t_W at W.5. Draw line AH perpendicular to t_W through A.6. Construct line OW.7. Draw line l through P perpendicular to OW.8. Find H as the intersection of AH and l.9. Draw line PH.10. Construct BC as the chord of ω perpendicular to OW (since BC is parallel to PH and PH is perpendicular to OW).Wait, no. If BC is parallel to PH, and PH is perpendicular to OW, then BC is also perpendicular to OW. Therefore, BC is the unique chord of ω perpendicular to OW. Therefore, there is only one such chord.Therefore, BC is the chord of ω perpendicular to OW. To construct this chord:1. Find the line perpendicular to OW passing through O. Wait, no. The chord BC is perpendicular to OW at M, which lies on OW.Therefore, M is the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC. But BC is itself perpendicular to OW, so M is the foot of OW onto BC, which is the same as the foot of BC onto OW.Wait, this is confusing.Alternatively, since BC is perpendicular to OW, and it&#39;s a chord of ω, then BC is the unique chord perpendicular to OW. Therefore, there is only one such chord, which can be constructed by:1. Finding the line perpendicular to OW passing through the point M, where M is the midpoint of BC.2. But since M lies on OW, and BC is perpendicular to OW at M, then M is the foot of the perpendicular from O to BC.But without knowing M, this is circular.Alternatively, since the distance from O to BC is equal to the length of OM, where M is the midpoint of BC. Then, using the formula for the distance from the center to a chord: OM = R cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OW and OB.But this might not help.Alternatively, parametrize the line BC as follows:- Since BC is perpendicular to OW, its direction is known.- It passes through some point M on OW.- Find M such that BC is a chord of ω and W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.This is similar to the midpoint of the arc corresponding to chord BC.But how?Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A, the central angle for arc BW is equal to the central angle for arc WC. Therefore, if we let angle BOW = angle WOC = alpha, then the central angle for arc BC is 2 alpha, and the central angle for arc BAC is 360 - 2 alpha degrees.But without knowing alpha, this isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, if we consider the reflection of O over BC, it should lie on the circumcircle. Wait, reflecting O over BC gives a point O&#39; such that BO&#39;C is congruent to BOC. But W is the midpoint of arc BC, so perhaps O&#39; is related to W.But I&#39;m not sure.Maybe the key is to realize that once we have BC perpendicular to OW and passing through M on OW, then W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A. Therefore, the central angles for arcs BW and WC are equal. Therefore, OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC.Given that, and BC perpendicular to OW, then triangles BOW and COW are congruent.Therefore, BO = CO = R, angles BOW = COW = theta, and triangles BOW and COW are congruent.Therefore, the coordinates of B and C can be found by reflecting over OW.But since we are in synthetic geometry, perhaps construct B and C as reflections.But without coordinate system, this is abstract.But given that BC is perpendicular to OW, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, then B and C are symmetric with respect to OW.Therefore, to construct BC:1. Reflect point W over OW to get a point W&#39; (but this is W itself).Wait, no. Reflect the arc.Alternatively, construct the circle with diameter OW. Not helpful.Alternatively, construct the perpendicular bisector of OW, which is the same as the line BC.Wait, no.Alternatively, since BC is perpendicular to OW, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the reflection of B over OW is C, and vice versa.Therefore, once BC is perpendicular to OW, B and C are symmetric with respect to OW.Therefore, given that, and that BC is a chord of ω, we can construct BC as follows:1. Draw the line OW.2. Construct the line l perpendicular to OW at some point M.3. The intersection points of l and ω are B and C.4. Check if W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.5. Adjust M until W is the midpoint.But this is trial and error.However, given that BC must be perpendicular to OW, there is only one such chord (perpendicular to OW) for which W is the midpoint of arc BC.Therefore, the correct chord BC is the one perpendicular to OW such that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.Therefore, BC is the unique chord perpendicular to OW such that W is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A.Therefore, once we have OW, and we know that BC is perpendicular to OW, we can construct BC as follows:1. The line BC is perpendicular to OW.2. The midpoint M of BC lies on OW.3. W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.Therefore, the chord BC is the unique chord perpendicular to OW such that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A.Therefore, this must be the chord passing through the point obtained by rotating A around OW by 180 degrees. Not sure.Alternatively, using power of a point. The power of W with respect to BC is equal to the square of the tangent from W to BC. But W lies on the circumcircle, so the power is zero. Therefore, WB * WC = WA * W something. Not helpful.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the power of W with respect to BC is WB^2 = WC^2 = WA * WP. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, consider that since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the line AW is the angle bisector of angle BAC.But I think I need to stop here and summarize the construction steps based on the previous deductions.Final Construction Steps:1. Given points A, P, W.2. Construct the circumcircle ω of triangle APW.3. Find the center O of ω.4. Construct the tangent line t_W to ω at point W.5. Draw line AH perpendicular to t_W through point A.6. Construct line OW.7. Draw line l through point P perpendicular to line OW.8. Find the intersection point H of line AH and line l.9. Construct line PH.10. Draw line BC parallel to line PH such that W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A. (This is achieved by constructing BC as the chord of ω perpendicular to OW, which is parallel to PH since PH is perpendicular to OW.)11. The intersections of line BC with ω are points B and C.12. The triangle ABC is now reconstructed with vertices A, B, C.Verification:- W is the midpoint of arc BC not containing A by construction.- P is the second intersection of circle s (with diameter AH) and ω, since H was constructed such that P lies on circle s.Therefore, this construction satisfies all given conditions.Final Answerboxed{ABC}&lt;/think&gt;Given points (A), (P), and (W) on the circumcircle (omega) of triangle (ABC), we need to reconstruct triangle (ABC). Here are the key steps:1. Construct the circumcircle (omega): The circumcircle (omega) is determined by points (A), (P), and (W).2. Find the center (O) of (omega): The center (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of chords (AP), (AW), and (PW).3. Construct the tangent (t_W) at (W): The tangent line (t_W) at point (W) to the circumcircle (omega) is drawn.4. Draw line (AH) perpendicular to (t_W): The line (AH) is constructed through (A) and perpendicular to the tangent (t_W). This line (AH) is the altitude from (A) to (BC).5. Construct line (OW): The line (OW) connects the center (O) of (omega) to point (W).6. Draw line (l) through (P) perpendicular to (OW): Line (l) is constructed through (P) and perpendicular to (OW).7. Find the orthocenter (H): The intersection of line (AH) (from step 4) and line (l) (from step 6) gives the orthocenter (H).8. Construct line (PH): The line (PH) connects points (P) and (H).9. Determine line (BC): Line (BC) is constructed as the chord of (omega) that is parallel to (PH) and for which (W) is the midpoint of arc (BC) not containing (A). This is achieved by ensuring (BC) is perpendicular to (OW) and passes through the midpoint of the arc (BC).10. Find points (B) and (C): The intersections of line (BC) with the circumcircle (omega) are the vertices (B) and (C).By following these steps, triangle (ABC) is reconstructed with the given points (A), (P), and (W).[boxed{ABC}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I have this geometry problem here where I need to reconstruct triangle ABC given points A, P, and W. Let me try to parse the problem again carefully.We have triangle ABC. The angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC again at point W. So, the angle bisector starts at A, splits angle BAC into two equal parts, and then intersects the circumcircle ω at another point W. Got that.Then there&#39;s another circle s, which has diameter AH, where H is the orthocenter of ABC. This circle s intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. So, circle s passes through A and H, and intersects the original circumcircle ω at point P (other than A, presumably). So, P is the second intersection point of circle s and ω.Now, the problem is: given points A, P, and W, restore triangle ABC. So, starting from these three points, figure out where B and C must be such that all the given conditions are satisfied.Hmm. Let me think. Since W is the intersection of the angle bisector of angle A with the circumcircle, and P is the second intersection of the circle with diameter AH and the circumcircle, there must be some relationships between these points that can help me determine B and C.First, let&#39;s recall some properties:1. The angle bisector of angle A meets the circumcircle again at W, which is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A. Wait, is that true? If the angle bisector meets the circumcircle again at W, then W is the midpoint of arc BC. Wait, yes, because the angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides, but in the circumcircle, the angle bisector from A should pass through the midpoint of arc BC. So, W is the midpoint of arc BC. Therefore, arc BW equals arc WC. So, that&#39;s a key point.2. The circle with diameter AH: H is the orthocenter. The circle with diameter AH implies that any angle subtended by AH in this circle s is a right angle. So, for any point on circle s, say point X, the angle AXH is 90 degrees. Therefore, point P lies on both the circumcircle ω and circle s, so angle APH is 90 degrees. Therefore, PH is perpendicular to AP. Wait, but AP is a chord of the circumcircle, and PH is perpendicular to it? Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s clarify. If P is on circle s with diameter AH, then angle APH is 90 degrees. Therefore, PH is the altitude from P to AH? Wait, no. Since AH is the diameter, then any point P on circle s will satisfy that angle APH is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle APH has a right angle at P. So, PH is perpendicular to AP. So, PH is the altitude from P to AP? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, since AH is the diameter, the center of circle s is the midpoint of AH. Let&#39;s denote that as O_s. Then the radius of circle s is half of AH.But maybe it&#39;s better to use coordinate geometry here? Maybe set up coordinates with point A at the origin or something? Hmm. Alternatively, use inversion or other projective geometry techniques. But given that we need to reconstruct ABC from A, P, W, perhaps there&#39;s a more synthetic approach.Let me think about the relationships between these points. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then AW is the angle bisector. Also, in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H has certain properties. For example, reflections of H over the sides lie on the circumcircle. Also, the reflection of H over the midpoint of BC is the point diametrically opposite A on the circumcircle. Wait, is that right?Wait, more precisely, the reflection of the orthocenter H over the side BC lies on the circumcircle. Similarly, the reflection over the midpoint, maybe not. Let me recall: reflecting H over BC gives a point on the circumcircle. Similarly, reflecting H over the midpoint of BC gives the point opposite to A. Wait, maybe.Alternatively, if we take the antipodal point of A on the circumcircle, which is A&#39;, then A&#39; is the reflection of H over the Euler line midpoint? Not sure.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a relation between points P and H. Since P lies on both ω and s, and s has diameter AH, so PH is perpendicular to AP. So, in triangle APH, angle at P is 90 degrees. So, PH is an altitude of triangle APH.But H is the orthocenter of ABC. So, H lies somewhere inside or outside the triangle, depending on whether ABC is acute or obtuse. So, if ABC is acute, H is inside; if ABC is obtuse, H is outside.But given that we have circle s with diameter AH, which contains point P. So, regardless, H is one endpoint of the diameter, and A is the other. So, the circle s passes through H and A, with AH as diameter. Therefore, P is another intersection point of s and ω.Given that, perhaps there is a way to construct H from P? Since angle APH is 90 degrees, H must lie on the line perpendicular to AP at P. So, given point A and P, we can construct the line AP, then H lies somewhere on the line perpendicular to AP at P. But H is the orthocenter of ABC, which we need to reconstruct. So, maybe we can first find H, and then from H, determine B and C?But how? Let&#39;s think. If we can find H, then since H is the orthocenter, we can relate it to the triangle&#39;s altitudes. But without knowing B and C, it&#39;s not straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps use properties of W. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, which is equidistant from B and C on the circumcircle. Also, the angle bisector of angle A passes through W. So, if we can find BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, and then H is the orthocenter.Alternatively, maybe inversion could help. Inversion with respect to the circumcircle ω? If we invert about ω, then the circle s would invert to some line or circle. But since s passes through A, which is on ω, inversion might send it to a line. Hmm, but this might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that both P and W lie on ω, and certain angles can be related.Given that angle APH = 90°, since P is on circle s. So, PH ⊥ AP. So, if we can construct H such that PH is perpendicular to AP, and H is the orthocenter of ABC.But how does H relate to W? Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, perhaps there is a symmedian point or something involved. Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that H lies on the nine-point circle, but circle s here is different.Wait, let&#39;s recall that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H, and the midpoint of AH is the center of circle s. So, if we can find the midpoint of AH, which is the center of circle s, then we can perhaps construct circle s given points A and H.But since we don&#39;t know H, perhaps we can use point P. Since P is on both ω and s, so given A, P, W, perhaps we can find H first.Let me try to outline steps:1. Given points A, P, W on circumcircle ω.2. W is the midpoint of arc BC. So, if we can find BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, then BC is the chord such that W is the midpoint.3. Then, given that the circle s with diameter AH passes through P. So, since P is on s, then angle APH = 90°, so PH is perpendicular to AP.Therefore, given A and P, H lies on the line perpendicular to AP at P. So, H is somewhere along that line. Then, since H is the orthocenter of ABC, once we find H, we can reconstruct ABC.But how?Alternatively, since H is the orthocenter, then BH is perpendicular to AC, and CH is perpendicular to AB. So, if we can find lines BH and CH such that they are altitudes.But since we don&#39;t know B and C, this seems circular.Wait, but perhaps with W being the midpoint of arc BC, we can relate it to H. For example, in some triangles, the orthocenter has a known relation to the circumcircle. For instance, the reflection of the orthocenter over BC lies on the circumcircle. So, if H is the orthocenter, then reflecting H over BC gives a point on ω. But again, without BC, this is tricky.Wait, but if W is the midpoint of arc BC, then perhaps the midpoint of arc BC is equidistant from B and C, and also, in some cases, related to symmedians or other triangle centers.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H, the midpoint of arc BC (which is W), and other points form certain cyclic quadrilaterals or have specific angle relations.Alternatively, perhaps construct the midpoint of arc BC as W, then construct H such that PH is perpendicular to AP, and then from H, construct the altitudes to find B and C.Wait, here&#39;s an idea: Let&#39;s suppose that we can construct H by taking the foot of the perpendicular from P to AP. Wait, but PH is perpendicular to AP, so H lies along the line perpendicular to AP at P. Therefore, given point P and line AP, H is somewhere along the line perpendicular to AP at P.But we need more constraints to determine H&#39;s exact position. Since H is the orthocenter, which depends on B and C. But since we need to find B and C, perhaps there&#39;s a way to relate H with W.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the reflection of H over BC lies on the circumcircle. Let me recall that property: reflecting the orthocenter H over side BC gives a point H&#39; which lies on the circumcircle of ABC. Similarly, reflecting H over the midpoint of BC gives another point on the circumcircle.Wait, yes, reflecting H over BC gives a point on the circumcircle. So, H&#39; (reflection of H over BC) is on ω. Similarly, the antipodal point of A is the reflection of H over the nine-point circle center? Not exactly sure.Alternatively, if I can relate point P to H&#39;. If H&#39; is the reflection of H over BC, then H&#39; is on ω, so perhaps H&#39; is a known point related to P or W.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, and H&#39; is on ω, maybe there&#39;s an angle relation between W and H&#39;.Alternatively, think about Euler line. The orthocenter H, centroid G, and circumcenter O lie on the Euler line. But without knowing the centroid or circumradius, this might not help directly.Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that in circle s (with diameter AH), point P lies on it and on ω. Therefore, AP is a common chord of circles ω and s. Wait, but AP is just a chord passing through A. The common chord would be the line where the two circles intersect, which is points A and P. So, the line AP is the radical axis of circles ω and s.Therefore, the radical axis of ω and s is line AP. Since radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles. Therefore, the line joining the centers of ω and s is perpendicular to AP.The center of ω is the circumcenter O of triangle ABC, and the center of s is the midpoint of AH, which we can denote as O_s. Therefore, the line OO_s is perpendicular to AP.Therefore, if we can find O, the circumradius center, then O_s lies along the line perpendicular to AP at its midpoint? Wait, no. Wait, the radical axis is AP, and the line joining centers O and O_s is perpendicular to AP. So, OO_s is perpendicular to AP.Given that, if we can find O, then O_s must lie along the line through O perpendicular to AP. But since O_s is the midpoint of AH, then once we know O_s, we can find H as the reflection of A over O_s. Wait, no. If O_s is the midpoint of AH, then H is the reflection of A over O_s. Wait, midpoint M of AH: H = 2*M - A. So, if O_s is the midpoint, then H = 2*O_s - A.Therefore, if we can find O_s, which is the center of circle s, then we can find H. But how?But we know that O_s is the midpoint of AH, and OO_s is perpendicular to AP. So, if we can determine O_s such that O_s lies along the line perpendicular to AP at O, but we need to know O.Alternatively, since O is the circumradius center of ABC, and W is the midpoint of arc BC, then O lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Also, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC.Wait, maybe not. Let me recall: The circumcenter O is equidistant from all three vertices. The midpoint of arc BC is W, so the line OW is the angle bisector of angle BOC. Therefore, OW is the bisector of angle BOC.But if we can reconstruct BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, then O lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. But without BC, we can&#39;t directly find O.Alternatively, perhaps construct point W as the midpoint of arc BC. So, given points A, P, W on ω, perhaps we can use some known configurations.Wait, maybe construct the circumcircle ω with points A, P, W. Then, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, BC can be any chord such that W is the midpoint of its arc. Then, with BC variable, but such that the angle bisector of angle A passes through W. But how does P come into play?Since P is on both ω and circle s (with diameter AH). So, once BC is determined, H is determined as the orthocenter, and then circle s with diameter AH would pass through P. Therefore, the position of P is dependent on BC. Therefore, given P, this constrains BC such that the circle with diameter AH passes through P.This seems quite involved. Let me try to approach step by step.1. Let me consider the circumcircle ω with points A, P, W. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the points B and C must lie on ω such that W is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A (or containing A, depending on the triangle). Wait, actually, the angle bisector of angle A meets ω again at W, which is the midpoint of arc BC. If ABC is acute, then the arc BC not containing A is the major arc, and W is its midpoint. If ABC is obtuse at A, then the arc BC containing A is the major arc, and W would be its midpoint. So, depending on the position of W, ABC could be acute or obtuse.But regardless, given W is the midpoint of arc BC (either major or minor), so BC is a chord of ω with midpoint of arc at W.2. Now, the circle s with diameter AH passes through P. Therefore, P lies on s, so angle APH = 90°, meaning that PH is perpendicular to AP.Therefore, given point A and P, H must lie on the line perpendicular to AP at P.So, if I can construct that line, then H is somewhere on it. But H is the orthocenter of ABC, which depends on BC. So, H is determined once BC is determined. Therefore, there must be a unique BC such that H lies on that perpendicular line.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding points B and C on ω such that:a. W is the midpoint of arc BC.b. The orthocenter H of ABC lies on the line perpendicular to AP at P.Given that, how can I find such B and C?Perhaps proceed as follows:Step 1: Draw the circumcircle ω with given points A, P, W.Step 2: Construct the line l perpendicular to AP at P. This line l contains the orthocenter H.Step 3: For any chord BC through ω such that W is the midpoint of arc BC, compute H as the orthocenter of ABC and check if it lies on l.But since we need a construction, not just an existence proof, this approach isn&#39;t directly helpful.Alternatively, perhaps there is a unique such triangle ABC. Therefore, perhaps there is a way to construct BC given A, P, W.Another thought: Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the line AW is the angle bisector. Also, since H is the orthocenter, the Euler line connects H, O (circumcenter), and G (centroid). But without knowing O or G, maybe this isn&#39;t helpful.Wait, but O is the center of ω. If we can construct O, then perhaps we can find relationships. But since ω is given with points A, P, W, the center O can be constructed as the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of chords AP, AW, etc. But since the problem states &quot;restore the triangle ABC&quot;, meaning we have the points A, P, W on ω, but we don&#39;t necessarily have ω drawn. Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;the bisector of angle A of triangle ABC meets its circumcircle ω at point W&quot;. So, ω is the circumcircle of ABC, which we need to reconstruct. But we are given points A, P, W, which lie on ω. So, we have three points on ω, so ω can be determined (if they are not colinear). Since A, P, W are on the circumcircle, we can construct ω from these three points. Therefore, ω is uniquely determined by A, P, W. Therefore, we can assume ω is known.Therefore, given ω with points A, P, W, reconstruct ABC such that:- The angle bisector of angle A meets ω again at W.- The circle s with diameter AH meets ω again at P.So, let&#39;s rephrase:We have the circumcircle ω passing through A, B, C, W, P. We know that W is the second intersection of the angle bisector of angle A with ω, and P is the second intersection of circle s (with diameter AH) with ω.We need to find points B and C on ω such that:1. W is the midpoint of arc BC.2. The orthocenter H lies such that circle s with diameter AH passes through P.Therefore, H must lie on the line perpendicular to AP at P (since angle APH = 90°). So, H is somewhere on that line. But H is also the orthocenter of ABC, which depends on B and C.Therefore, perhaps the key is to find H as the intersection of the orthocenter conditions and lying on the line perpendicular to AP at P.Alternatively, perhaps the reflection of H over BC lies on ω. Let me recall that reflecting the orthocenter over BC gives a point on the circumcircle. So, if H&#39; is the reflection of H over BC, then H&#39; is on ω.But since H lies on the line perpendicular to AP at P, then H&#39; would lie on the reflection of that line over BC. But I don&#39;t know BC yet, so this seems circular.Alternatively, maybe consider that since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the midpoint M of BC lies on the tangent at W. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, use the fact that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H, the midpoint W of arc BC, and some other points form certain cyclic quadrilaterals. Wait, not sure.Wait, here&#39;s a theorem: In any triangle, the orthocenter H, the midpoint W of arc BC, and the circumcenter O are colinear. Wait, is that true?Wait, the Euler line connects H, O, and G (the centroid). But W is a different point. However, in some cases, W might lie on the Euler line? For example, in an equilateral triangle, all centers coincide. But in general, maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps there is a relation between H and W via inversion or reflection.Alternatively, consider the following approach:Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the line AW is the angle bisector, and also, in some properties, the symmedian line passes through certain points, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system.Let me place point A at (0,0) for simplicity. Let me assume that the circumcircle ω is the unit circle. Wait, but then points A, P, W are on the unit circle, but A is at (0,0). Wait, that&#39;s a conflict because (0,0) can&#39;t be on the unit circle unless the radius is 0. So, maybe place A at (1,0), and the circumcircle as the unit circle. Then, points A, P, W are on the unit circle.Wait, let me set coordinate system such that the circumcircle ω is the unit circle centered at the origin (0,0). Let point A be at (1,0). Let points P and W be two other points on the unit circle. Let their coordinates be P(cos θ, sin θ) and W(cos φ, sin φ). Then, we need to reconstruct points B and C on the unit circle such that:1. W is the midpoint of arc BC.2. The circle s with diameter AH passes through P, where H is the orthocenter.So, given this coordinate system, let&#39;s try to find coordinates of B and C.First, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then B and C are symmetric with respect to the line OW, where O is the center (origin). So, if W is at angle φ, then points B and C can be represented as W rotated by ±α around the center. That is, their angles are φ ± α. Since W is the midpoint, the arc from B to W is equal to the arc from W to C. Therefore, the angle between B and W is equal to the angle between W and C.Therefore, coordinates of B and C can be written as (cos(φ ± α), sin(φ ± α)). Then, the angle α is such that the arc length from B to W is equal to the arc from W to C.Alternatively, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, then the points B and C are reflections over the line OW. Therefore, if we let B = (cos φ&#39;, sin φ&#39;), then C is (cos φ&#39;, -sin φ&#39;) if W is on the x-axis, but since W is arbitrary, maybe need a better approach.Alternatively, parameterize points B and C such that angle BOW = angle WOC. Since O is the center, this would mean that vectors OB and OC are symmetric with respect to OW. Therefore, if we let vector OB = (cos(φ - β), sin(φ - β)) and vector OC = (cos(φ + β), sin(φ + β)), then W is the midpoint of arc BC, which is at angle φ.Therefore, points B and C can be represented as:B: (cos(φ - β), sin(φ - β))C: (cos(φ + β), sin(φ + β))for some angle β.Therefore, with this parameterization, we can express coordinates of B and C in terms of β.Now, the orthocenter H of triangle ABC. In the coordinate system where the circumcircle is the unit circle and the circumcenter is at the origin, the orthocenter H has coordinates given by the formula:H = A + B + CWait, yes! In the coordinate system where the circumcenter is at the origin, the orthocenter H is the sum of the coordinates of A, B, and C. This is a well-known formula in triangle geometry.Since our circumradius is 1, but in general, if the triangle is inscribed in the unit circle, then H = A + B + C.Wait, let me verify. If the circumradius is R, then the orthocenter&#39;s coordinates are A + B + C if the circumcenter is at the origin. Since we&#39;ve set the circumradius to 1, and the circumcenter at (0,0), then yes, H = A + B + C.Therefore, in our coordinate system, with A at (1,0), B at (cos(φ - β), sin(φ - β)), and C at (cos(φ + β), sin(φ + β)), then:H = A + B + C = (1 + cos(φ - β) + cos(φ + β), 0 + sin(φ - β) + sin(φ + β)).Simplify using trigonometric identities:cos(φ - β) + cos(φ + β) = 2 cos φ cos βsin(φ - β) + sin(φ + β) = 2 sin φ cos βTherefore, H = (1 + 2 cos φ cos β, 2 sin φ cos β)Now, the circle s has diameter AH. Since A is (1,0) and H is (1 + 2 cos φ cos β, 2 sin φ cos β), the midpoint of AH is the center of circle s:O_s = ((1 + (1 + 2 cos φ cos β))/2, (0 + 2 sin φ cos β)/2) = (1 + cos φ cos β, sin φ cos β)The radius of circle s is half the length of AH. Let&#39;s compute AH:AH = sqrt[(2 cos φ cos β)^2 + (2 sin φ cos β)^2] = sqrt[4 cos² β (cos² φ + sin² φ)] = sqrt[4 cos² β] = 2 |cos β|Since we&#39;re dealing with coordinates, we can assume β is such that cos β is positive, so radius is 2 cos β * 0.5 = cos β. Wait, no, the radius is half of AH, which is (2 |cos β|)/2 = |cos β|. So, radius is |cos β|.But since the circle s has diameter AH, and we&#39;ve computed its center O_s, we can write the equation of circle s:(x - (1 + cos φ cos β))² + (y - sin φ cos β)² = (cos β)²Now, point P lies on both circle s and the circumcircle ω (which is the unit circle x² + y² = 1). Therefore, substituting y² = 1 - x² into the equation of circle s:(x - 1 - cos φ cos β)² + (sin φ cos β)^2 = cos² βExpand the left-hand side:(x - 1 - cos φ cos β)^2 + sin² φ cos² β= [x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + (1 + cos φ cos β)^2] + sin² φ cos² β= x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β + cos² φ cos² β + sin² φ cos² βNote that cos² φ cos² β + sin² φ cos² β = cos² β (cos² φ + sin² φ) = cos² β.Therefore, the expression simplifies to:x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β + cos² βSet equal to cos² β:x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β + cos² β = cos² βSubtract cos² β from both sides:x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β = 0This simplifies to:x² - 2x(1 + cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β = 0Let&#39;s rearrange terms:x² - 2x + (-2x cos φ cos β) + 1 + 2 cos φ cos β = 0Factor terms with cos φ cos β:x² - 2x + 1 + (-2x cos φ cos β + 2 cos φ cos β) = 0Note that x² - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2And factor out 2 cos φ cos β:(x - 1)^2 + 2 cos φ cos β (1 - x) = 0Therefore:(x - 1)^2 + 2 cos φ cos β (1 - x) = 0Let’s factor (1 - x):(1 - x)[ - (1 - x) + 2 cos φ cos β ] = 0Wait, expanding that:= (1 - x)(x - 1 + 2 cos φ cos β) = 0So, either 1 - x = 0, which implies x = 1, which corresponds to point A (since A is (1,0)), or:x - 1 + 2 cos φ cos β = 0Therefore, x = 1 - 2 cos φ cos βTherefore, the other intersection point P has x-coordinate 1 - 2 cos φ cos β, and since P lies on the unit circle, we can find its y-coordinate.Given that x_P = 1 - 2 cos φ cos β, then y_P² = 1 - x_P².But also, in our parameterization, P is given as a point on the unit circle with coordinates (cos θ, sin θ). Therefore, we can equate:cos θ = 1 - 2 cos φ cos βsin θ = ±sqrt(1 - (1 - 2 cos φ cos β)^2)But since in our parameterization, H has coordinates (1 + 2 cos φ cos β, 2 sin φ cos β), and we also have point P as (cos θ, sin θ), we can relate θ and φ.Let me try to compute sin θ:y_P = sin θ = ±sqrt(1 - (1 - 2 cos φ cos β)^2)Compute inside the sqrt:1 - (1 - 4 cos φ cos β + 4 cos² φ cos² β) =1 - 1 + 4 cos φ cos β - 4 cos² φ cos² β =4 cos φ cos β (1 - cos φ cos β)Therefore,sin θ = ±2 sqrt(cos φ cos β (1 - cos φ cos β))But this seems complicated. Let me think if there&#39;s another relation.Alternatively, since we have point P as (cos θ, sin θ), and we have H = (1 + 2 cos φ cos β, 2 sin φ cos β), then the circle s with diameter AH must pass through P. Therefore, the condition that P lies on s is equivalent to PH ⊥ AP.But since we are in coordinates, we can use the condition that (P - A) ⋅ (H - P) = 0, since AP is the vector from A to P, and PH is the vector from P to H, and their dot product is zero.Vector AP = P - A = (cos θ - 1, sin θ - 0) = (cos θ - 1, sin θ)Vector PH = H - P = (1 + 2 cos φ cos β - cos θ, 2 sin φ cos β - sin θ)Their dot product must be zero:(cos θ - 1)(1 + 2 cos φ cos β - cos θ) + (sin θ)(2 sin φ cos β - sin θ) = 0Let me expand this:(cos θ - 1)(1 - cos θ + 2 cos φ cos β) + sin θ (2 sin φ cos β - sin θ) = 0First term:(cos θ - 1)(1 - cos θ) + (cos θ - 1)(2 cos φ cos β) + 2 sin θ sin φ cos β - sin² θ = 0Compute each part:(cos θ - 1)(1 - cos θ) = - (1 - cos θ)^2(cos θ - 1)(2 cos φ cos β) = 2 cos φ cos β (cos θ - 1)2 sin θ sin φ cos β = 2 sin φ cos β sin θ-sin² θTherefore, combining:- (1 - cos θ)^2 + 2 cos φ cos β (cos θ - 1) + 2 sin φ cos β sin θ - sin² θ = 0Now, note that - (1 - cos θ)^2 - sin² θ = -1 + 2 cos θ - cos² θ - sin² θ = -1 + 2 cos θ - (cos² θ + sin² θ) = -1 + 2 cos θ - 1 = 2 cos θ - 2Therefore, the equation simplifies to:(2 cos θ - 2) + 2 cos φ cos β (cos θ - 1) + 2 sin φ cos β sin θ = 0Factor out 2:2[ (cos θ - 1) + cos φ cos β (cos θ - 1) + sin φ cos β sin θ ] = 0Divide both sides by 2:(cos θ - 1)(1 + cos φ cos β) + sin φ cos β sin θ = 0Now, let&#39;s rewrite terms:= (cos θ - 1)(1 + cos φ cos β) + sin φ cos β sin θ = 0Expand the first term:cos θ (1 + cos φ cos β) - (1 + cos φ cos β) + sin φ cos β sin θ = 0Bring all terms to one side:cos θ (1 + cos φ cos β) + sin θ sin φ cos β - (1 + cos φ cos β) = 0Factor out cos β from the first two terms:cos β [ cos θ (1/ cos β + cos φ) + sin θ sin φ ] - (1 + cos φ cos β) = 0Wait, this might not be helpful. Let me consider another approach.Let me denote γ = φ - θ. Let’s see if we can relate angles φ and θ.Alternatively, recognize that the expression resembles a cosine of difference:cos θ (1 + cos φ cos β) + sin θ sin φ cos β = 1 + cos φ cos βSo,cos θ (1 + cos φ cos β) + sin θ sin φ cos β = 1 + cos φ cos βLet me subtract 1 + cos φ cos β from both sides:cos θ (1 + cos φ cos β) + sin θ sin φ cos β - (1 + cos φ cos β) = 0Factor out (1 + cos φ cos β) from first and third terms:(1 + cos φ cos β)(cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φ cos β = 0This is the same as before.Alternatively, factor cos β from the first two terms:cos β [ (1 + cos φ cos β)/cos β (cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φ ] = 0But this complicates things more.Alternatively, use the identity for cos(θ - φ):cos(θ - φ) = cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φBut in our expression, we have:(1 + cos φ cos β)(cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φ cos β = 0Let me expand (1 + cos φ cos β)(cos θ - 1):= (cos θ - 1) + cos φ cos β (cos θ - 1)= cos θ - 1 + cos φ cos β cos θ - cos φ cos βThen, adding sin θ sin φ cos β:Total expression:cos θ - 1 + cos φ cos β cos θ - cos φ cos β + sin θ sin φ cos β = 0Combine terms with cos β:cos β [ cos φ cos θ - cos φ + sin θ sin φ ] + cos θ - 1 = 0Factor cos φ and sin φ:cos β [ cos φ (cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φ ] + cos θ - 1 = 0Notice that cos φ (cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φ = cos(θ - φ) - cos φWait, because:cos(θ - φ) = cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φTherefore,cos(θ - φ) - cos φ = cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ - cos φ = cos φ (cos θ - 1) + sin θ sin φWhich is exactly the term in the brackets. Therefore, the expression becomes:cos β [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ] + (cos θ - 1) = 0Therefore,cos β [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ] = 1 - cos θLet me solve for cos β:cos β = (1 - cos θ) / [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ]This is a key equation relating β, θ, and φ. Remember that θ and φ are known because points P and W are given on ω. Therefore, angles θ and φ correspond to the positions of P and W on the circumcircle.Therefore, cos β can be computed as (1 - cos θ) divided by [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ].Therefore, once we compute cos β from this formula, we can find β, and hence determine the coordinates of B and C as:B: (cos(φ - β), sin(φ - β))C: (cos(φ + β), sin(φ + β))Therefore, the reconstruction is possible once β is determined.Now, let&#39;s check if this is feasible. Given that θ and φ are known (since points P and W are given), we can compute cos β using the above formula. Then β can be found, and hence points B and C can be located.Therefore, the steps to reconstruct ABC are:1. Given points A, P, W on the circumcircle ω.2. Convert these points into angular coordinates θ (for P) and φ (for W), with A at (1,0).3. Compute cos β using the formula:cos β = (1 - cos θ) / [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ]4. Once cos β is known, compute β.5. Then, determine points B and C as:B: (cos(φ - β), sin(φ - β))C: (cos(φ + β), sin(φ + β))6. These points B and C, along with A, form the desired triangle ABC.However, we need to ensure that this is valid and that the denominator isn&#39;t zero. Let&#39;s check the denominator:cos(θ - φ) - cos φ.If this is zero, then we have division by zero. Let&#39;s analyze when this happens.cos(θ - φ) - cos φ = 0=&gt; cos(θ - φ) = cos φWhich implies θ - φ = ±φ + 2πk, k integer.Therefore, θ = φ ± φ + 2πk =&gt; θ = 2φ + 2πk or θ = 0 + 2πk.But since θ and φ are angles corresponding to distinct points P and W on the circle, and A is at angle 0, θ = 0 would correspond to point A, but P is different from A. Similarly, θ = 2φ would need to be analyzed, but depending on φ, this might not necessarily hold. Therefore, unless P is located such that θ = 2φ or θ = 0, the denominator is non-zero, and the formula works.Therefore, under the assumption that P is not located at A or at the reflection point related to W, the formula gives a valid cos β.Once cos β is computed, β can be found, and hence points B and C can be constructed.Therefore, the reconstruction is unique (up to reflection over line OW), given the points A, P, W.Therefore, the answer is that the triangle can be uniquely reconstructed by constructing points B and C as outlined above.But since the problem asks to &quot;restore the triangle ABC&quot;, the actual construction steps would involve:1. Given points A, P, W on the circumcircle.2. Determine the angular positions of P and W relative to A.3. Calculate β using the formula derived.4. Plot points B and C symmetrically around W on the circumcircle at angles φ ± β.But to write this in a synthetic geometry way, without coordinates, perhaps the following steps:- Given points A, P, W on a circle ω.- Construct the line l perpendicular to AP at P (since PH ⊥ AP).- The orthocenter H must lie on line l.- Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, construct the chord BC such that W is the midpoint of arc BC.- For each such BC, compute H as the orthocenter.- Find the specific BC for which H lies on l.But this is a bit vague. However, given the coordinate analysis shows that there&#39;s a unique solution, the construction is possible.Another synthetic approach:1. Draw the circumcircle ω through A, P, W.2. Construct the line l perpendicular to AP at P.3. The orthocenter H lies on l.4. Since W is the midpoint of arc BC, the points B and C are such that AW is the angle bisector and W is the arc midpoint.5. The key insight is that the orthocenter H for the desired triangle must lie on line l.6. Use the fact that in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H satisfies certain reflection properties over the sides or midlines.But connecting this to W is non-trivial.Alternatively, use the following theorem: In any triangle, the orthocenter, the midpoint of the arc, and the symmedian point are collinear. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use the fact that the reflection of H over AW lies on the circumcircle. Maybe this is a property.Alternatively, construct point H as the intersection of line l (perpendicular to AP at P) and the line that is somehow related to W.Wait, given the coordinate calculation, which gives a unique solution, perhaps the triangle can be uniquely determined, and the construction is as follows:1. Given A, P, W.2. Find the circumcircle ω.3. Draw the line AP and erect a perpendicular at P; this is the line containing H.4. Calculate the position of H using the formula derived from the coordinate system (cos β expression).5. Once H is determined, find B and C such that H is the orthocenter and W is the midpoint of arc BC.But since we can&#39;t calculate coordinates directly in a synthetic construction, perhaps another method.Alternatively, since H = A + B + C in the coordinate system where circumradius is 1 and circumcenter is origin, then B + C = H - A.Given that, and knowing that B and C are symmetric with respect to OW, we can construct B and C.But this requires vector addition, which is coordinate-based.Perhaps, given the complexity, the problem expects a specific construction:Given points A, P, W on the circumcircle, the orthocenter H lies on the perpendicular to AP at P. Then, since W is the midpoint of arc BC, BC is the chord such that W is the midpoint. Then, the orthocenter H can be constructed as the intersection of the altitudes. Since we know H must lie on the perpendicular to AP at P, and knowing that H is the orthocenter, we can use this to find BC.Alternatively, construct the circle with diameter AH, which must pass through P. Therefore, AH is the diameter, so H is the reflection of A over the center of circle s. But the center of circle s is the midpoint of AH, which lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP (since circle s passes through A and P). Wait, no, the center of circle s is the midpoint of AH, and circle s passes through P. Therefore, the midpoint of AH is equidistant from A, H, and P.But since we are in the coordinate system where this can be calculated, but synthetic geometry...This is getting quite involved. Given the time I&#39;ve spent and the coordinate-based solution, I think the key takeaway is that the triangle can be uniquely reconstructed by constructing H as the intersection point on the perpendicular to AP at P, then using H and W to determine B and C such that W is the midpoint of arc BC and H is the orthocenter.Therefore, the answer is that the triangle ABC can be uniquely determined by constructing B and C as the intersection points of the circumcircle ω with the reflections/rotations determined by W and the orthocenter condition involving P.But to write a step-by-step construction:1. Given points A, P, W on the circumcircle ω.2. Construct the line l perpendicular to AP at P.3. Construct the circle s with diameter AH, where H is the orthocenter. Since H lies on l, construct H as the intersection point of line l with the circle s. Wait, but we don&#39;t know H yet.Alternatively, since P is on circle s, then H must lie on line l and satisfy that AH is the diameter. Therefore, for any point H on line l, the circle s with diameter AH passes through P. Therefore, H is the second intersection point of line l with the circle such that AH is the diameter and P is on it. But since l is perpendicular to AP at P, and circle s must pass through P, the center of circle s is the midpoint of AH, which must be such that the distance from the midpoint to P is equal to the radius (AH/2).Wait, this is a bit convoluted. Let&#39;s use the fact that if P lies on circle s with diameter AH, then the midpoint of AH is the center of s, and lies at the midpoint between A and H. Therefore, the midpoint M of AH is such that MP = MA = MH, since s has radius MA = MH.Therefore, given point P, the midpoint M must satisfy that MP = MA. Therefore, M lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AP.But M is also the midpoint of AH, which lies on line l (the perpendicular to AP at P), but wait, no. Wait, midpoint M of AH is determined by H lying on line l.Therefore, midpoint M is the midpoint between A and H, which is ((A_x + H_x)/2, (A_y + H_y)/2). Since H lies on line l (perpendicular to AP at P), then M lies along the line connecting A and H. But given that M must also lie on the perpendicular bisector of AP.Therefore, M is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of AP and the line connecting A and H. But since H is on l, connecting A and H would be a line from A to some point on l.But since M must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AP, which is the set of points equidistant from A and P. Therefore, the midpoint M of AH must be equidistant from A and P, and also lies on the line connecting A and H, which is a line from A to some point H on l.Therefore, to find M:1. Find the perpendicular bisector of AP.2. For any point H on line l, compute M as the midpoint of AH.3. Find H such that M lies on the perpendicular bisector of AP.This condition is necessary because M must be equidistant from A and P (since MP = MA).Therefore, the intersection of the line AM (where M is midpoint of AH) with the perpendicular bisector of AP gives the location of M, hence H.But since this is a constructive step, let&#39;s outline:1. Draw the perpendicular bisector of AP.2. The midpoint M of AH must lie on this perpendicular bisector.3. Since H is on line l (perpendicular to AP at P), the line AH connects A to H on l.4. The midpoint M of AH is also on the perpendicular bisector of AP.5. Therefore, M is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of AP and the line joining A to H.Wait, but H is variable on l, so M is variable. But we need M to be on the perpendicular bisector of AP. Therefore, the locus of midpoints M as H moves along l is a line. The intersection of this locus with the perpendicular bisector of AP gives the required M.Alternatively, parametrize H on l, compute M, and find when M is on the perpendicular bisector.But this is getting into coordinate geometry again. Let&#39;s use coordinates.Let me set coordinate system with A at (0,0), P at (p, 0) for simplicity (since AP can be aligned with the x-axis). Wait, no, if I set AP as the x-axis, then the perpendicular to AP at P is the y-axis. Wait, yes, maybe.Let me try setting coordinates:Let’s place point A at (0,0), point P at (2a, 0), so that AP is along the x-axis with length 2a. Then, the line l perpendicular to AP at P is the vertical line x = 2a. Therefore, H lies somewhere on x = 2a.The midpoint M of AH is ((0 + 2a)/2, (0 + k)/2) = (a, k/2), where H is (2a, k).The circle s with diameter AH has center M and radius sqrt((2a)^2 + k^2)/2.But point P lies on circle s, so the distance from M to P must be equal to the radius.Compute distance from M(a, k/2) to P(2a, 0):sqrt((2a - a)^2 + (0 - k/2)^2) = sqrt(a² + k²/4)Radius is sqrt((2a)^2 + k²)/2 = sqrt(4a² + k²)/2Set equal:sqrt(a² + k²/4) = sqrt(4a² + k²)/2Square both sides:a² + k²/4 = (4a² + k²)/4Multiply both sides by 4:4a² + k² = 4a² + k²Which is an identity. Therefore, any point H on line l will result in circle s passing through P. Wait, this contradicts our previous result where we derived a specific formula for cos β. What&#39;s going on here?Ah, because in this coordinate system, we fixed AP along the x-axis and set A at (0,0) and P at (2a,0). Then, any H on line l (x=2a) will result in circle s passing through P. Therefore, in this specific coordinate setup, the circle s with diameter AH always passes through P, regardless of where H is on l. Therefore, this suggests that there are infinitely many triangles ABC with given A, P, W, which contradicts the earlier uniqueness.But in the previous coordinate system where we had the circumcircle as the unit circle, we found a unique solution. So, there must be a mistake in this latest coordinate analysis.Wait, in this coordinate system, the circumcircle isn&#39;t fixed. If we fix AP along the x-axis but the circumcircle ω is determined by points A, P, W, which in this case are A(0,0), P(2a,0), and W somewhere else. The previous analysis in the unit circle coordinate system had the circumcircle fixed, which imposed additional constraints. So, in the current coordinate system, we are not fixing the circumcircle, hence leading to multiple possibilities.Therefore, returning to the original problem, since points A, P, W are on the circumcircle ω, the position of W relative to A and P adds additional constraints, leading to a unique solution.Therefore, the correct approach is the first coordinate system where the circumcircle is fixed as the unit circle, leading to a unique solution for β, and hence unique points B and C.Therefore, given that in the unit circle coordinate system, with A at (1,0), P at (cos θ, sin θ), W at (cos φ, sin φ), we can compute β and hence B and C.Therefore, the answer is that the triangle ABC can be uniquely determined by constructing points B and C as the points on the circumcircle ω, symmetric with respect to line OW, such that the orthocenter H lies on the perpendicular to AP at P.To translate this into a construction:1. Given points A, P, W on ω.2. Construct the line l perpendicular to AP at P.3. Find point H on line l such that H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC with W as the midpoint of arc BC.4. Once H is determined, construct the Euler line or use reflection properties to find B and C.But step 3 is still abstract. However, using the earlier formula for cos β, which relates the angles of P and W, we can compute β and hence find B and C.Therefore, the key insight is the formula:cos β = (1 - cos θ) / [ cos(θ - φ) - cos φ ]This allows us to compute β and thus determine B and C.Therefore, the final answer is that the triangle can be uniquely reconstructed, and the construction involves finding the angle β using the given points and then placing B and C symmetrically around W on the circumcircle.Final Answerboxed{ABC text{ can be uniquely determined by the given points } A, P, W}&lt;/think&gt;Given points (A), (P), and (W) on the circumcircle (omega) of triangle (ABC), we need to reconstruct triangle (ABC) such that (W) is the midpoint of arc (BC) (not containing (A)) and (P) is the second intersection of the circle (s) with diameter (AH) (where (H) is the orthocenter of (ABC)) with (omega).1. Understanding the Problem:   - (W) is the midpoint of arc (BC), meaning (AW) is the angle bisector of (angle BAC).   - Circle (s) with diameter (AH) passes through (P), implying (angle APH = 90^circ). Thus, (H) lies on the line perpendicular to (AP) at (P).2. Key Properties and Relationships:   - The orthocenter (H) must lie on the line perpendicular to (AP) at (P).   - (W) is the midpoint of arc (BC), so (B) and (C) are symmetric with respect to the line (OW) (where (O) is the circumcenter).3. Coordinate System Approach:   - Place the circumcircle (omega) on the unit circle with (A) at ((1, 0)).   - Parameterize points (B) and (C) as ((cos(phi pm beta), sin(phi pm beta))) where (phi) is the angle corresponding to (W).   - Calculate the orthocenter (H) using the formula (H = A + B + C).4. Determining (beta):   - Use the condition that (P) lies on both (omega) and the circle (s) with diameter (AH).   - Derive the formula for (cos beta) using trigonometric identities and the coordinates of (P), (A), and (W).5. Reconstructing (B) and (C):   - Once (beta) is determined, compute the coordinates of (B) and (C) as ((cos(phi - beta), sin(phi - beta))) and ((cos(phi + beta), sin(phi + beta))).6.

There are three parts here, so I need to handle each one carefully. Let&#39;s start with part (1).Problem (1): When c=3, find the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at the point (1, f(1)).First, I need to recall that the equation of a tangent line at a point requires two things: the slope of the tangent at that point and a point through which the tangent passes. The formula for the tangent line is ( y = f(a) + f&#39;(a)(x - a) ), where ( a ) is the x-coordinate of the point.Given ( f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x + c ) and ( c = 3 ), so the function becomes ( f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x + 3 ). The point in question is (1, f(1)). Let&#39;s compute f(1):( f(1) = (1)^3 - (1)^2 - (1) + 3 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 3 = 2 ). So the point is (1, 2).Next, find the derivative f&#39;(x) to get the slope. The derivative of ( x^3 ) is ( 3x^2 ), the derivative of ( -x^2 ) is ( -2x ), the derivative of ( -x ) is ( -1 ), and the derivative of a constant (3) is 0. So:( f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 2x - 1 ).Now evaluate f&#39;(1):( f&#39;(1) = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) - 1 = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0 ).Wait, so the slope at x=1 is 0? That means the tangent line is horizontal there. So the equation of the tangent line is y = 2 + 0*(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 2. Let me check that again. The point is (1, 2), and the slope is 0. Yes, a horizontal line through (1, 2) is y=2. That seems right. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the derivative? Let me check:Original function: ( x^3 - x^2 - x + 3 ). Derivative term by term:- ( 3x^2 ) from ( x^3 )- ( -2x ) from ( -x^2 )- ( -1 ) from ( -x )- 0 from the constant 3.So f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 2x - 1. Then plug in x=1: 3(1) - 2(1) -1 = 0. Correct. So yes, the tangent line is horizontal at that point. So part (1)&#39;s answer is y=2.Problem (2): Find the intervals where the function f(x) is monotonic.Monotonicity is determined by the sign of the derivative. If the derivative is non-negative throughout an interval, the function is non-decreasing (monotonically increasing) there; if non-positive, non-increasing (monotonically decreasing). So we need to find intervals where f&#39;(x) ≥ 0 or f&#39;(x) ≤ 0.From part (1), we already found f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 2x -1. Let&#39;s analyze this quadratic.First, find the critical points by solving f&#39;(x)=0:3x² - 2x -1 = 0.Use quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 6 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] /6 = [2 ±4]/6.So, x = (2 +4)/6 = 6/6=1, and x=(2-4)/6 = (-2)/6 = -1/3.So critical points at x = -1/3 and x=1. The quadratic 3x² -2x -1 opens upwards (since coefficient of x² is positive), so the derivative is positive outside the roots and negative between them.Therefore:- For x &lt; -1/3, f&#39;(x) &gt;0: increasing- Between -1/3 and 1, f&#39;(x) &lt;0: decreasing- For x &gt;1, f&#39;(x) &gt;0: increasingHence, the function is increasing on (-∞, -1/3) and (1, ∞), decreasing on (-1/3, 1). Therefore, the intervals of monotonicity are separated by these critical points.Wait, but the question says &quot;find the intervals where the function f(x) is monotonic&quot;. So the function is monotonic on intervals where it is entirely increasing or entirely decreasing. So the answer should be the intervals (-∞, -1/3], [-1/3, 1], and [1, ∞). Wait, but do we need to check the endpoints? Since the function is differentiable everywhere, the critical points are at x=-1/3 and x=1. So the intervals would be separated by these points. So the function is monotonic on each of these intervals. So the answer is:Increasing on (-∞, -1/3] and [1, ∞); decreasing on [-1/3, 1].But sometimes people use open intervals when discussing monotonicity between critical points. Let me check: Since the derivative is positive for x &lt; -1/3 and x &gt;1, and negative in between. So technically, the function is increasing on (-∞, -1/3) and (1, ∞), decreasing on (-1/3,1). But at the exact points x=-1/3 and x=1, the derivative is zero. Whether we include these points in the intervals is a matter of convention. If the function is increasing on an interval including the endpoints where the derivative is zero, then it&#39;s still considered non-decreasing. But strictly speaking, if we want &quot;monotonic&quot; as strictly increasing or decreasing, then those points where derivative is zero would need attention. However, in calculus, when we say a function is increasing on an interval, we often include points where the derivative is zero, as long as the derivative is non-negative throughout. So the function is non-decreasing (monotonically increasing) on (-∞, -1/3] and [1, ∞), and non-increasing (monotonically decreasing) on [-1/3,1]. So those would be the intervals of monotonicity. However, the problem says &quot;monotonic&quot;, which can be either non-decreasing or non-increasing. So the answer is that f(x) is increasing on (-∞, -1/3] and [1, ∞), decreasing on [-1/3,1]. So I&#39;ll present that.Problem (3): Let g(x) = [f(x) - x³] * e^x. If g(x) is monotonically increasing on [-3,2], find the range of c.First, let&#39;s parse this. Given f(x) = x³ -x² -x + c, so f(x) -x³ = -x² -x +c. Therefore, g(x) = (-x² -x +c) * e^x.We need g(x) to be monotonically increasing on [-3,2]. For a function to be monotonically increasing, its derivative must be non-negative on the entire interval.So first, compute the derivative g&#39;(x), set it ≥0 for all x in [-3,2], then solve for c.Let&#39;s compute g&#39;(x):g(x) = (-x² -x +c)e^xThe derivative is by the product rule: g&#39;(x) = [d/dx (-x² -x +c)] * e^x + (-x² -x +c) * d/dx e^xCompute derivative of the first part:d/dx (-x² -x +c) = -2x -1Derivative of e^x is e^x.Thus,g&#39;(x) = (-2x -1)e^x + (-x² -x +c)e^xFactor out e^x (which is always positive, so the sign of g&#39;(x) is determined by the remaining factor):g&#39;(x) = [ (-2x -1) + (-x² -x +c) ] e^xSimplify inside the brackets:-2x -1 -x² -x +c = -x² -3x + (c -1)So g&#39;(x) = [ -x² -3x + (c -1) ] e^xSince e^x &gt;0 for all real x, the inequality g&#39;(x) ≥0 for all x in [-3,2] is equivalent to: -x² -3x + (c -1) ≥0 for all x in [-3,2]Therefore, we need: -x² -3x + (c -1) ≥0  ⇨  c -1 ≥ x² +3x  ⇨  c ≥ x² +3x +1For all x in [-3,2].Therefore, c must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the function h(x) = x² +3x +1 on the interval [-3,2]. Thus, c ≥ max{ h(x) | x ∈ [-3,2] }.So we need to find the maximum of h(x) = x² +3x +1 over [-3,2].First, h(x) is a quadratic function opening upwards (coefficient of x² is positive). Its vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -3/(2*1) = -1.5. The vertex is a minimum since it opens upwards. Therefore, the maximum on a closed interval will occur at one of the endpoints.Compute h(-3): (-3)^2 +3*(-3) +1 =9 -9 +1=1Compute h(2): 2² +3*2 +1=4 +6 +1=11Thus, the maximum of h(x) on [-3,2] is 11. Therefore, c must be ≥11.Hence, the range of c is [11, ∞).Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let&#39;s verify the steps again.We started with g&#39;(x) = [ -x² -3x + (c -1) ] e^x. Since e^x is always positive, the condition g&#39;(x) ≥0 is equivalent to -x² -3x + (c -1) ≥0 ⇒ c -1 ≥ x² +3x ⇒ c ≥ x² +3x +1. Therefore, c must be greater than or equal to x² +3x +1 for all x in [-3,2]. Hence, c needs to be at least the maximum value of x² +3x +1 on that interval.As h(x) =x² +3x +1 is a quadratic with vertex at x = -1.5, which is within the interval [-3,2]. Since the quadratic opens upwards, the maximum on the interval will indeed be at the right endpoint x=2, which gives h(2)=4 +6 +1=11. The left endpoint x=-3 gives h(-3)=9 -9 +1=1. The vertex at x=-1.5 gives h(-1.5)= (2.25) + (-4.5) +1= -1.25. So the maximum on the interval is indeed 11, so c must be ≥11. Therefore, the range is c ≥11, which in interval notation is [11, ∞).But wait, let&#39;s test c=11. Then, for all x in [-3,2], x² +3x +1 ≤11. At x=2, x² +3x +1=11, so equality holds. For x in [-3,2], h(x) reaches maximum 11, so if c=11, then c ≥ h(x) for all x in the interval, so equality holds at x=2, so g&#39;(2)=0. But if the derivative is zero at a single point (x=2), does that affect the monotonicity? The problem states that g(x) is monotonically increasing on [-3,2]. A function can be monotonically increasing even if its derivative is zero at some points, as long as the derivative is non-decreasing and does not become negative. Since at c=11, the derivative is non-negative (zero at x=2 and positive elsewhere in the interval), so g(x) is indeed monotonically increasing. Therefore, c can be 11 and any larger number, so the answer is c ≥11.Therefore, the range of c is [11, ∞).Let me just check another point. Let&#39;s take c=11 and check another x value, say x=1. Then h(1)=1 +3 +1=5 ≤11, so c=11 is okay. At x=0, h(0)=0 +0 +1=1 ≤11. At x=-1.5, h(-1.5)=2.25 + (-4.5) +1= -1.25, which is ≤11. So yes, c=11 satisfies h(x) ≤c for all x in [-3,2].Therefore, part (3)&#39;s answer is c ≥11.Summary:1. The tangent line at (1, f(1)) when c=3 is y=2.2.

When ( c = 3 ), find the equation of the tangent line to the function ( f(x) ) at the point ( (1, f(1)) ):   - First, compute ( f(1) ):     [     f(1) = 1^3 - 1^2 - 1 + 3 = 2     ]   - The point is ( (1, 2) ).   - Compute the derivative ( f&#39;(x) ):     [     f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 2x - 1     ]   - Evaluate the derivative at ( x = 1 ):     [     f&#39;(1) = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) - 1 = 0     ]   - The slope of the tangent line is 0.

Final Answer(1) The equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = 2}.(2) The function is increasing on boxed{(-infty, -frac{1}{3}]} and boxed{[1, infty)}, and decreasing on boxed{[-frac{1}{3}, 1]}.(3) The range of ( c ) is boxed{[11, infty)}.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. There are three parts here, so I need to tackle each one by one. Let&#39;s start with part (1).Problem (1): When c=3, find the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at the point (1, f(1)).Alright, so first, let&#39;s recall that the equation of a tangent line at a point (a, f(a)) is given by y = f(a) + f’(a)(x - a). Here, a is 1. So I need to compute f(1) and f’(1) when c=3.Given f(x) = x³ - x² - x + c. When c=3, that becomes f(x) = x³ - x² - x + 3.First, compute f(1):f(1) = (1)³ - (1)² - (1) + 3 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 3 = (1 -1) + (-1 +3) = 0 + 2 = 2. So the point is (1, 2).Now, compute the derivative f’(x) to find the slope at x=1.f’(x) = 3x² - 2x - 1. Then f’(1) = 3(1)² - 2(1) -1 = 3 - 2 -1 = 0. Wait, the slope is 0? That means the tangent line is horizontal at that point.So the equation of the tangent line is y = f(1) + 0*(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 2. Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating f’(1).Wait, derivative: 3x² - 2x -1. Plug in x=1: 3*1 -2*1 -1 = 3 -2 -1 = 0. Hmm, that&#39;s correct. So the slope is indeed 0. So the tangent line is horizontal at y=2. That seems straightforward.So part (1) is done. The tangent line is y=2.Problem (2): Find the intervals where the function f(x) is monotonic.Monotonicity is determined by the derivative. If f’(x) ≥ 0 on an interval, the function is non-decreasing (monotonically increasing) there; if f’(x) ≤ 0, it&#39;s non-increasing (monotonically decreasing). To find the intervals, we need to analyze the sign of f’(x).Given f(x) = x³ - x² - x + c. The derivative is f’(x) = 3x² - 2x -1. Since the derivative is a quadratic function, we can find its critical points by solving 3x² -2x -1 =0.Let&#39;s solve 3x² -2x -1 =0. Using quadratic formula:x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / (2*3) = [2 ± sqrt(16)] /6 = [2 ± 4]/6.So, x = (2 +4)/6 =6/6=1, and x=(2-4)/6=(-2)/6= -1/3.So the critical points are x= -1/3 and x=1. These divide the real line into three intervals:1. (-∞, -1/3)2. (-1/3, 1)3. (1, ∞)Now, we need to test the sign of f’(x) in each interval.Pick a test point in each interval:1. For (-∞, -1/3), let&#39;s take x=-1.f’(-1) = 3*(-1)² -2*(-1) -1 = 3*1 +2 -1 = 3 +2 -1 =4. Positive. So f’(x) &gt;0 here, so the function is increasing.2. For (-1/3, 1), let&#39;s take x=0.f’(0) = 3*0 -2*0 -1 = -1. Negative. So f’(x) &lt;0 here, function is decreasing.3. For (1, ∞), take x=2.f’(2)= 3*(4) -2*(2) -1 =12 -4 -1=7. Positive. So f’(x) &gt;0 here, function increasing.Therefore, the function is increasing on (-∞, -1/3] and [1, ∞), decreasing on [-1/3, 1]. So those are the intervals where it&#39;s monotonic.So part (2) answer is: f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-∞, -1/3] and [1, ∞), and monotonically decreasing on [-1/3, 1].Problem (3): Let g(x)=[f(x)-x³]·e^x. If g(x) is monotonically increasing on [-3,2], find the range of c.First, let&#39;s parse g(x). Given f(x) = x³ -x² -x +c, so f(x) -x³ = -x² -x +c. Hence, g(x) = (-x² -x +c) * e^x.So g(x) = (-x² - x + c)e^x. We need g(x) to be monotonically increasing on [-3,2]. For a function to be monotonically increasing, its derivative must be non-negative on the interval.Therefore, we need g’(x) ≥0 for all x in [-3,2].So first, compute g’(x). Let&#39;s do that.g(x) = (-x² -x +c)e^x. Use the product rule:g’(x) = [d/dx (-x² -x +c)] * e^x + (-x² -x +c)*d/dx(e^x)Compute derivatives:d/dx (-x² -x +c) = -2x -1d/dx(e^x) = e^xTherefore,g’(x) = (-2x -1)e^x + (-x² -x +c)e^xFactor out e^x:g’(x) = [(-2x -1) + (-x² -x +c)] e^xCombine like terms inside the brackets:-2x -1 -x² -x +c = -x² -3x + (c -1)Thus, g’(x) = (-x² -3x +c -1)e^x.Since e^x is always positive for all real x, the sign of g’(x) is determined by the quadratic expression -x² -3x +c -1.Therefore, the condition g’(x) ≥0 on [-3,2] is equivalent to:-x² -3x +c -1 ≥0 for all x ∈ [-3,2]Which simplifies to:c ≥ x² +3x +1 for all x ∈ [-3,2]Therefore, c must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of x² +3x +1 on the interval [-3,2].Thus, to find the range of c, we need to compute the maximum of the function h(x) =x² +3x +1 on [-3,2], then set c ≥ that maximum.So now, let&#39;s find the maximum of h(x) =x² +3x +1 on [-3,2].First, note that h(x) is a quadratic function opening upwards (since the coefficient of x² is positive). Therefore, its minimum is at the vertex, and the maximum on a closed interval will occur at one of the endpoints.But let&#39;s confirm by checking the critical points.Compute h’(x) =2x +3. Setting derivative to zero: 2x +3=0 → x= -3/2= -1.5.So the critical point is at x= -1.5. Since the interval is [-3,2], x= -1.5 is inside the interval.Therefore, the maximum of h(x) on [-3,2] will be the maximum of h(-3), h(2), and h(-1.5).Compute h(-3):h(-3) = (-3)^2 +3*(-3) +1 =9 -9 +1=1.h(2)=2² +3*2 +1=4 +6 +1=11.h(-1.5)= (-1.5)^2 +3*(-1.5) +1=2.25 -4.5 +1= (2.25 +1) -4.5=3.25 -4.5= -1.25.So the maximum is h(2)=11 and h(-3)=1. Comparing these, the maximum is 11.Therefore, to satisfy c ≥ h(x) for all x ∈ [-3,2], c must be ≥11.Therefore, the range of c is [11, ∞).Wait, but let me check once more. Since h(x) reaches 11 at x=2, and at x=-3 it&#39;s 1, and the minimum is -1.25. But since we need c to be greater than or equal to h(x) for all x in [-3,2], so c must be greater than or equal to the maximum h(x) on that interval. So yes, if c is at least 11, then h(x) ≤ c for all x in [-3,2], so the inequality -x² -3x +c -1 ≥0 holds, so g’(x) ≥0, hence g(x) is increasing.Therefore, the answer is c ≥11, which is written as [11, ∞).Wait, but let me check again. The quadratic in g’(x) is -x² -3x +c -1. So rearranged, c ≥ x² +3x +1. So yes, c must be greater or equal to the maximum of x² +3x +1 on [-3,2]. Which is 11. Therefore, c ∈ [11, ∞).But let me just verify the calculation of h(2):h(2)=2² +3*2 +1=4+6+1=11. Correct.h(-3)= (-3)^2 +3*(-3)+1=9-9+1=1.h(-1.5)= (-1.5)^2 +3*(-1.5) +1=2.25-4.5+1= -1.25. Correct.So maximum is 11. Therefore, c≥11. So the range is [11, ∞).Therefore, part (3)&#39;s answer is c ≥11.Final Answer(1) The equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = 2}.(2) The function is increasing on boxed{(-infty, -frac{1}{3}]} and boxed{[1, infty)}, and decreasing on boxed{[-frac{1}{3}, 1]}.(3) The range of ( c ) is boxed{[11, infty)}.&lt;/think&gt;(1) When ( c = 3 ), the function is ( f(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x + 3 ).

For gleft(xright) to be monotonically increasing on [-3,2], hleft(xright)geqslant 0 must hold within this interval. With the vertex of h(x) at x=-frac{3}{2} and it opening downwards, we focus on hleft(2right)geqslant 0:[-2^{2}-3cdot2+c-1geqslant 0 Rightarrow -4-6+c-1geqslant 0 Rightarrow cgeqslant 11.]Therefore, the range of real numbers for c is boxed{[11,+infty)}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-da700b3c><span data-v-da700b3c>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
