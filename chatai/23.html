find x² + y². The answer choices are given, so that might help later. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:1. xy = 62. x²y + xy² + x + y = 63Hmm, okay. The first equation is straightforward; the product of x and y is 6. The second equation looks a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can factor or simplify it somehow. Looking at the left side of the second equation: x²y + xy² + x + y. I notice that the first two terms, x²y and xy², can be factored. Let&#39;s factor out an xy from those terms:xy(x + y) + x + y = 63Oh, that&#39;s better. So, after factoring, it becomes xy(x + y) + (x + y) = 63. Then, I can factor out (x + y) from the entire expression:(xy + 1)(x + y) = 63Interesting. Since we know from the first equation that xy = 6, we can substitute that into this equation. Let&#39;s do that:(6 + 1)(x + y) = 637(x + y) = 63Now, dividing both sides by 7 gives:x + y = 9So now we have two equations:1. xy = 62. x + y = 9These are the standard sum and product of two numbers. From these, I can form a quadratic equation whose roots are x and y. Let me write that down.Let’s let x and y be the roots of the quadratic equation t² - (x + y)t + xy = 0. Plugging in the known values:t² - 9t + 6 = 0But maybe we don&#39;t need to solve for x and y explicitly. The problem asks for x² + y². I remember that x² + y² can be expressed in terms of (x + y)² - 2xy. Let me verify that:(x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²Therefore, x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xyYes, that&#39;s correct. So plugging in the known values:x² + y² = (9)² - 2*(6) = 81 - 12 = 69Wait, that seems straightforward. Then, the answer should be 69, which is option D. Let me check the answer choices again to confirm:A) 13, B) 1173/32, C)55, D)69, E)81Yes, D is 69, which is what I got. But wait, let me make sure there&#39;s no trick here. Did I make any assumption that might not hold?I started with the given equations, factored the second one by noticing the common terms, substituted xy = 6, then found x + y = 9. Then used the identity for x² + y². It all seems logical. Let me double-check the substitution step.Original second equation: x²y + xy² + x + y = 63Factored as xy(x + y) + (x + y) = (xy + 1)(x + y) = 63Given that xy = 6, then (6 + 1)(x + y) = 63 =&gt; 7(x + y) = 63 =&gt; x + y = 9. That seems correct.Then x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 9² - 2*6 = 81 -12= 69. Correct.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a case where x and y aren&#39;t real numbers? But the answer choices include 69, which we arrived at, so even if there are complex solutions, the question just says &quot;find x² + y²&quot;, which would be the same for both roots. Wait, no, complex numbers might have different x² + y²? Wait, no. If x and y are roots of t² -9t +6=0, then regardless of whether they are real or complex, x + y =9 and xy=6. Therefore, x² + y² is always (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 81 -12=69. So even if the solutions are complex numbers, x² + y² would still be 69. So the answer is 69, which is D.But maybe I should check by solving for x and y explicitly. Let me try that.From x + y =9 and xy=6, the quadratic is t² -9t +6=0. Let&#39;s solve this quadratic.Using quadratic formula:t = [9 ± sqrt(81 -24)] /2 = [9 ± sqrt(57)] /2So x and y are [9 + sqrt(57)] /2 and [9 - sqrt(57)] /2. Then let&#39;s compute x² + y².First, compute x²:([9 + sqrt(57)] /2)^2 = (81 + 18 sqrt(57) +57)/4 = (138 + 18 sqrt(57))/4 = (69 + 9 sqrt(57))/2Similarly, y²:([9 - sqrt(57)] /2)^2 = (81 - 18 sqrt(57) +57)/4 = (138 -18 sqrt(57))/4 = (69 -9 sqrt(57))/2Adding x² + y²:(69 +9 sqrt(57))/2 + (69 -9 sqrt(57))/2 = (69 +69)/2 = 138/2 =69Yes, that gives 69 again. So even if we calculate explicitly, it&#39;s 69. Therefore, the answer is D.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to trick us into thinking it&#39;s straightforward, but perhaps there are multiple solutions or something. Let me check if the system has other solutions.Wait, given that xy=6 and x + y=9, those are the only constraints. The quadratic equation t² -9t +6=0 has two solutions, real or complex. We saw they are real because the discriminant is 81 -24=57, which is positive, so x and y are real numbers. So there are two real solutions, but in both cases, x² + y² is 69. Therefore, answer is D.I don&#39;t see any mistakes in the logic. The answer should be D) 69.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the system of equations:1. (xy = 6)2. (x^2y + xy^2 + x + y = 63)We start by factoring the second equation:[x^2y + xy^2 + x + y = xy(x + y) + (x + y) = (xy + 1)(x + y)]Substituting (xy = 6) into the factored form, we get:[(6 + 1)(x + y) = 63 implies 7(x + y) = 63 implies x + y = 9]Now we have the sum (x + y = 9) and the product (xy = 6). To find (x^2 + y^2), we use the identity:[x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy]Substituting the known values:[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 - 2 cdot 6 = 81 - 12 = 69]Thus, the value of (x^2 + y^2) is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations where xy = 6 and x²y + xy² + x + y = 63, and then find x² + y². The answer choices are given, so maybe that can help check my work. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.First equation: xy = 6.Second equation: x²y + xy² + x + y = 63.Hmm. The second equation looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor something out. Let me look at the terms. The first two terms are x²y and xy². I notice both have an xy in them. Since I know xy = 6 from the first equation, maybe I can factor that out.So, x²y + xy² = xy(x + y). Let me check that: xy times x is x²y, and xy times y is xy². Yep, that works. So then the second equation becomes:xy(x + y) + x + y = 63.But xy is 6, so substitute that in:6(x + y) + x + y = 63.Combine like terms. Let&#39;s factor out (x + y):(6 + 1)(x + y) = 63 → 7(x + y) = 63.Divide both sides by 7:x + y = 9.Okay, so now we have two equations:1. x + y = 92. xy = 6These are the standard sum and product of two variables, which makes me think of solving a quadratic equation. If I let the variables be roots of t² - (x + y)t + xy = 0, then the quadratic would be t² - 9t + 6 = 0. But do I need to solve for x and y explicitly, or can I find x² + y² using just the sum and product?I remember that x² + y² can be written as (x + y)² - 2xy. Let me verify that:(x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y², so subtract 2xy to get x² + y². Yes, that&#39;s right.So, plugging in the known values:x² + y² = (9)² - 2*(6) = 81 - 12 = 69.Wait, 69 is one of the answer choices. Option D. Let me check if this is correct.But let me make sure I didn&#39;t skip any steps or make a mistake in the algebra. Let me go through it again.We had the original system:1. xy = 62. x²y + xy² + x + y = 63Factored x²y + xy² as xy(x + y), substituted xy = 6 to get 6(x + y). Then the equation becomes 6(x + y) + x + y = 63, which simplifies to 7(x + y) = 63, so x + y = 9. Then x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy = 81 - 12 = 69. That seems straightforward.But maybe the answer isn&#39;t 69? Let me check with the answer choices. The options are A)13, B)1173/32, C)55, D)69, E)81. 69 is D, which seems to be the result of my calculation.But just to be thorough, maybe I should check by solving for x and y explicitly and then compute x² + y². Let&#39;s try that.From x + y = 9 and xy = 6, the quadratic equation is t² - 9t + 6 = 0. Solving for t:t = [9 ± sqrt(81 - 24)] / 2 = [9 ± sqrt(57)] / 2.So, x and y are (9 + sqrt(57))/2 and (9 - sqrt(57))/2.Let&#39;s compute x² + y²:First, square each term:x² = [(9 + sqrt(57))/2]^2 = (81 + 18sqrt(57) + 57)/4 = (138 + 18sqrt(57))/4 = (69 + 9sqrt(57))/2.Similarly, y² = [(9 - sqrt(57))/2]^2 = (81 - 18sqrt(57) + 57)/4 = (138 - 18sqrt(57))/4 = (69 - 9sqrt(57))/2.Adding x² + y²:(69 + 9sqrt(57))/2 + (69 - 9sqrt(57))/2 = (69 + 69)/2 = 138/2 = 69.Okay, so that confirms it. x² + y² is indeed 69. So the answer is D) 69.But wait, before I finish, let me make sure that the values of x and y actually satisfy the original equations. Let me pick one of them, say x = (9 + sqrt(57))/2 and y = (9 - sqrt(57))/2.First, check xy = 6.Multiply x and y:[(9 + sqrt(57))/2] * [(9 - sqrt(57))/2] = [81 - (sqrt(57))²]/4 = [81 - 57]/4 = 24/4 = 6. That&#39;s correct.Now check the second equation: x²y + xy² + x + y.But we already know that x²y + xy² + x + y = 63, since that&#39;s how we derived x + y = 9. But just to confirm, let&#39;s compute x²y + xy².We have x²y + xy² = xy(x + y) = 6*9 = 54. Then add x + y = 9, so total is 54 + 9 = 63. Which matches the given equation. So everything checks out.Therefore, x² + y² is 69. The answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;Given the system of equations:1. ( xy = 6 )2. ( x^2y + xy^2 + x + y = 63 )We start by factoring the second equation. Notice that ( x^2y + xy^2 ) can be factored as ( xy(x + y) ). Substituting ( xy = 6 ) into the equation, we get:[6(x + y) + x + y = 63]Combining like terms, we have:[7(x + y) = 63]Solving for ( x + y ), we find:[x + y = 9]Now, we use the identities ( x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy ). Substituting the known values ( x + y = 9 ) and ( xy = 6 ):[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 - 2 cdot 6 = 81 - 12 = 69]To verify, we solve the quadratic equation ( t^2 - 9t + 6 = 0 ) with roots ( x ) and ( y ). The roots are ( frac{9 pm sqrt{57}}{2} ). Calculating ( x^2 + y^2 ) for these roots confirms the result:[x^2 + y^2 = left( frac{9 + sqrt{57}}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{9 - sqrt{57}}{2} right)^2 = 69]Thus, the final answer is (boxed{D}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9152f154></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>🔑:</span>First note that x^2y+xy^2+x+y= (xy+1)(x+y).

Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. That&#39;s important because it tells us about the symmetry of the function; specifically, odd functions are symmetric about the origin.Now, the function also satisfies f(x) = f(1 - x). This seems like a functional equation, and maybe I can use this to relate f(2010) to other values of the function. Let me try applying the given equation to x = 2010. If I substitute x = 2010 into the equation, I get:f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009)So f(2010) is equal to f(-2009). But since f is an odd function, f(-2009) = -f(2009). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009). Okay, so now I have f(2010) expressed in terms of f(2009). Maybe I can find a relationship between f(2009) and another value of the function?Let me apply the functional equation again to x = 2009. Then:f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008)Again, since f is odd, f(-2008) = -f(2008), so f(2009) = -f(2008). Therefore, substituting back into the previous equation, f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008). Interesting, so f(2010) = f(2008). Let&#39;s try this again with x = 2008:f(2008) = f(1 - 2008) = f(-2007) = -f(2007)Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2007). Hmm, so now f(2010) is -f(2007). Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a pattern here. Let me list out these relationships step by step:1. f(2010) = f(-2009) = -f(2009)2. f(2009) = f(-2008) = -f(2008) ⇒ f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008)3. f(2008) = f(-2007) = -f(2007) ⇒ f(2010) = -f(2007)4. f(2007) = f(-2006) = -f(2006) ⇒ f(2010) = -(-f(2006)) = f(2006)5. Continuing this pattern, each time we subtract 2 from the argument: f(2010) relates to f(2008), then f(2006), then f(2004), etc.Wait a minute, if each time we subtract 2, then perhaps we can express this as a general formula. Let&#39;s see:If we define n such that starting from 2010, each step we subtract 2k, then:f(2010) = (-1)^k * f(2010 - 2k)Is that right? Let&#39;s check with the previous steps. When k=1: f(2010) = -f(2009) = (-1)^1 * f(2010 - 2*1) = -f(2008). Wait, but in step 2, we had f(2010) = f(2008). Hmm, maybe my initial thought is off.Wait, let&#39;s track it again:From step 1: f(2010) = -f(2009)From step 2: f(2009) = -f(2008) ⇒ f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008)From step 3: f(2008) = -f(2007) ⇒ f(2010) = -f(2007)From step 4: f(2007) = -f(2006) ⇒ f(2010) = -(-f(2006)) = f(2006)So actually, each time we decrease the argument by 1, the sign alternates. Wait, but in step 1, from 2010 to 2009, it&#39;s a decrease of 1 with a sign flip. Then from 2009 to 2008, decrease by 1, sign flip again. But when we combined them, the total decrease from 2010 to 2008 is 2 with no sign flip. So maybe every two steps, the sign cancels out. Let&#39;s see:From 2010 to 2009: f(2010) = -f(2009)From 2009 to 2008: f(2009) = -f(2008), so f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008)From 2008 to 2007: f(2008) = -f(2007), so f(2010) = -f(2007)From 2007 to 2006: f(2007) = -f(2006), so f(2010) = -(-f(2006)) = f(2006)So alternating signs every step, but every two steps, it becomes positive again. Therefore, if we go k steps (each step decreasing by 1), f(2010) = (-1)^k * f(2010 - k). However, when we relate it back through two steps, it&#39;s f(2010) = f(2010 - 2). Similarly, after four steps, f(2010) = f(2010 - 4), and so on. So perhaps there&#39;s a periodicity here?Wait, if f(2010) = f(2008), and then f(2008) = f(2006), etc., then this suggests that f(x) is periodic with period 2? But wait, an odd function with period 2? Let&#39;s check that.Suppose f(x) is periodic with period 2. Then f(x + 2) = f(x). But since it&#39;s also an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s see if these two properties can coexist. For example, f(x + 2) = f(x), so f(1) = f(-1 + 2) = f(1). Hmm, not sure. Let me check with specific values. Suppose f(0) = 0 because it&#39;s an odd function. Then f(1) = f(1 - 0) = f(1), which tells us nothing. Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe the function has a smaller period. Let&#39;s see if we can find a period. From the relations:We know that f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s try to find a relation by applying this twice. Let&#39;s substitute x with 1 - x in the original equation. Then:f(1 - x) = f(1 - (1 - x)) = f(x). So that&#39;s just the original equation. So applying it twice brings us back. Hmm, not helpful.But if we combine this with the oddness, perhaps we can find a period. Let&#39;s see:From f(x) = f(1 - x) and f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s substitute x with 1 - x in the oddness condition:f(-(1 - x)) = -f(1 - x) =&gt; f(x - 1) = -f(1 - x)But from the original functional equation, f(1 - x) = f(x), so substituting that in:f(x - 1) = -f(x)So we get a new relation: f(x - 1) = -f(x). Interesting. Let&#39;s write that as:f(x) = -f(x - 1)This seems useful. So f at any point x is equal to negative f at x - 1. Let&#39;s see if we can iterate this:f(x) = -f(x - 1)Then, substituting x with x - 1:f(x - 1) = -f(x - 2)But from the previous equation, f(x) = -f(x - 1) = -(-f(x - 2)) = f(x - 2)So f(x) = f(x - 2). Therefore, f is periodic with period 2. So every 2 units, the function repeats. Therefore, the period is 2. So since the function is periodic with period 2, f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2). 2010 divided by 2 is 1005 with remainder 0. Therefore, 2010 mod 2 is 0. Therefore, f(2010) = f(0). But f is an odd function, and for odd functions, f(-0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = -f(0), which means f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.Wait, that seems straightforward once we figure out the periodicity. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t skip anything.We started with f(x) = f(1 - x) and f is odd. Then, using the odd property, we found that f(x - 1) = -f(x). Then, substituting x with x - 1 gives f(x - 1) = -f(x - 2). Therefore, combining with previous equation, -f(x) = -f(x - 2) =&gt; f(x) = f(x - 2). Hence, period 2. Then, since 2010 is even, f(2010) = f(0) = 0. That seems correct.Alternatively, let&#39;s verify with a smaller number. Suppose we want to compute f(2). Using the same logic:f(2) = f(1 - 2) = f(-1) = -f(1) (since it&#39;s odd). Then, f(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2) = -0 = 0. Similarly, f(3) = f(1 - 3) = f(-2) = -f(2) = -0 = 0, and so on. So all integers would map down to f(0) = 0. Hence, f(2010) = 0.Therefore, the answer should be 0. Let me make sure there&#39;s no mistake here. The key steps were deriving the relation f(x) = -f(x - 1), then showing that this leads to periodicity of 2. Then, since f(0) = 0 due to the function being odd, all even integers would evaluate to 0, and odd integers would also evaluate to 0 because they&#39;d be negative of an even integer&#39;s function value, which is 0. For example, f(1) = f(0) = 0, f(2) = f(-1) = -f(1) = 0, f(3) = f(-2) = -f(2) = 0, etc. So indeed, all integer values would be 0. Hence, f(2010) = 0.Final Answerboxed{0}&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on (mathbf{R}) and satisfies ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ), we need to find ( f(2010) ).1. Using the given functional equation:   [   f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009)   ]   Since ( f ) is an odd function, ( f(-2009) = -f(2009) ). Therefore,   [   f(2010) = -f(2009)   ]2. Applying the functional equation again:   [   f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008)   ]   Using the odd property again, ( f(-2008) = -f(2008) ). Therefore,   [   f(2009) = -f(2008) implies f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008)   ]3. Repeating the process:   [   f(2008) = f(1 - 2008) = f(-2007) = -f(2007)   ]   Thus,   [   f(2010) = -f(2007)   ]4. Generalizing the pattern:   By continuing this process, we observe that each step alternates the sign and decreases the argument by 1. However, combining the properties of the function, we derive:   [   f(x - 1) = -f(x)   ]   Substituting ( x ) with ( x - 1 ):   [   f(x - 2) = -f(x - 1) = f(x)   ]   This shows that ( f ) is periodic with period 2.5. Applying periodicity:   Since ( f ) is periodic with period 2, ( f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2) ). Calculating the remainder:   [   2010 div 2 = 1005 quad text{(remainder 0)}   ]   Thus, ( f(2010) = f(0) ).6. Using the odd function property:   For an odd function, ( f(0) = 0 ).Therefore, the value of ( f(2010) ) is (boxed{0}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of f(2010) given that f(x) is an odd function defined on all real numbers and it satisfies the equation f(x) = f(1 - x). Hmm, let me start by recalling what an odd function is. An odd function has the property that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. That means if I plug in a negative x, it&#39;s the same as the negative of the function evaluated at x. So, symmetry about the origin, right?Also, the function satisfies f(x) = f(1 - x). That seems like a functional equation. Maybe I can use this to relate the value at 2010 to some other point, and then use the property of being odd to find the value. Let me think.First, let me write down the given conditions:1. f(-x) = -f(x) for all x ∈ ℝ. (Since f is odd)2. f(x) = f(1 - x) for all x ∈ ℝ.So, combining these two might allow me to relate different points. Let me see. If I can express f(2010) in terms of another point using the second equation, and then maybe apply the oddness condition to that other point. Let&#39;s try that.From condition 2, f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009). Okay, so f(2010) is equal to f(-2009). But since f is odd, f(-2009) = -f(2009). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009).So now, f(2010) is expressed in terms of f(2009). But how does that help me? Maybe I can apply the same functional equation to f(2009) as well. Let&#39;s try that.Applying condition 2 again to f(2009):f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008). Then, using the oddness, f(-2008) = -f(2008). Therefore, f(2009) = -f(2008). Substituting back into the previous expression, f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008).So, f(2010) = f(2008). Hmm, interesting. It seems like applying the functional equation and the oddness condition alternately might lead to a pattern. Let&#39;s see if this continues.Let&#39;s do the same for f(2008). Applying condition 2:f(2008) = f(1 - 2008) = f(-2007). Then, by oddness: f(-2007) = -f(2007). Hence, f(2008) = -f(2007), which implies f(2010) = -f(2007).Wait, but previously f(2010) was equal to f(2008), and now f(2008) is -f(2007). So f(2010) = -f(2007). Hmm, so alternating signs?Wait, maybe I need to look for a pattern here. Let&#39;s see step by step:Start with f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009) = -f(2009).Then, f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008) = -f(2008).So, substituting back, f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008).Similarly, f(2008) = f(1 - 2008) = f(-2007) = -f(2007), so f(2010) = -f(2007).Continuing this:f(2007) = f(1 - 2007) = f(-2006) = -f(2006), so f(2010) = -(-f(2006)) = f(2006).It seems like every time we decrease the argument by 2, the sign flips twice, which cancels out. So f(2010) = f(2008) = f(2006) = ... and so on. But how far does this go?We need to see how many times we can subtract 2 from 2010 until we reach a point where we can relate it back to a known value. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a periodicity here? Let&#39;s check if the function is periodic.If we can find a period T such that f(x + T) = f(x) for all x, then we could reduce 2010 modulo T. Let&#39;s see if such a T exists.From condition 2: f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s apply this twice. Let&#39;s compute f(1 - x):f(1 - x) = f(1 - (1 - x)) = f(x). Wait, that&#39;s interesting. If we apply the functional equation twice, we get f(x) = f(1 - x) = f(1 - (1 - x)) = f(x). So applying it twice brings us back to the original value. That doesn&#39;t give us periodicity directly, but maybe combined with the oddness.Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can find a relation by combining the two properties. Let me try substituting x with 1 - x in the oddness condition. Wait, maybe another approach.Since f is odd, f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1). Wait, let&#39;s verify that. If we set y = 1 - x, then f(y) = f(1 - y) by condition 2. So substituting y = 1 - x, we have f(1 - x) = f(1 - (1 - x)) = f(x). But we also know that f is odd, so f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1). Therefore, combining these two, we get:f(x) = -f(x - 1).Wait, that&#39;s a key relation. Let me check that again.Since f is odd, f(1 - x) = -f(x - 1). But from condition 2, f(1 - x) = f(x). Therefore, f(x) = -f(x - 1). So this gives a recurrence relation: f(x) = -f(x - 1).So this seems like a useful relation. So f(x) = -f(x - 1). Therefore, shifting the argument by 1 changes the sign. Then, applying this recurrence relation multiple times:f(x) = -f(x - 1)f(x - 1) = -f(x - 2)Therefore, f(x) = -(-f(x - 2)) = f(x - 2)Similarly, f(x - 2) = -f(x - 3), so f(x) = -f(x - 3)Wait, but this seems inconsistent. Wait, let&#39;s do it step by step.Given f(x) = -f(x - 1).Then, f(x - 1) = -f(x - 2). Therefore, substituting back into the first equation:f(x) = -(-f(x - 2)) = f(x - 2).So, f(x) = f(x - 2). That suggests that the function is periodic with period 2. Because shifting x by 2 gives the same function value. Therefore, the function has period 2.Wait, so f(x) = f(x - 2). So periodicity with period 2. Therefore, since 2010 is an integer, and if the function is periodic with period 2, then f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2). But 2010 divided by 2 is 1005, so 2010 mod 2 is 0. Therefore, f(2010) = f(0).But wait, let&#39;s verify this periodicity.We have f(x) = -f(x - 1) and f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s check period 2.Compute f(x + 2):Using f(x + 2) = -f(x + 1) by the recurrence relation. Then, f(x + 1) = -f(x). Therefore, f(x + 2) = -(-f(x)) = f(x). So yes, f is periodic with period 2.Therefore, the function has period 2. So f(x + 2) = f(x) for all x. Therefore, f(2010) = f(0). But wait, f(0) is a special case for odd functions. Let&#39;s recall that for an odd function, f(-0) = -f(0). But since -0 = 0, this implies f(0) = -f(0). Therefore, 2f(0) = 0, so f(0) = 0.Therefore, f(2010) = f(0) = 0.So the answer should be 0.But let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, since f is odd, f(0) = 0. Then, since the function is periodic with period 2, f(2010) = f(0 + 2*1005) = f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.But let&#39;s check this with the original conditions.If f(x) = -f(x - 1), and also f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s see if these two conditions are consistent with f(0) = 0.Compute f(0):Using f(0) = f(1 - 0) = f(1). Also, since f is odd, f(-1) = -f(1). But also, using the recurrence f(x) = -f(x - 1), set x = 1: f(1) = -f(0). Therefore, f(1) = -f(0). But from the first equation, f(0) = f(1) = -f(0). Therefore, f(0) = -f(0) =&gt; 2f(0) = 0 =&gt; f(0) = 0. Then, f(1) = -f(0) = 0.Wait, so f(1) is also 0. Then, using periodicity, f(1) = f(1 + 2k) = 0 for any integer k. Similarly, f(0) = 0, so all even integers would map to f(0) and odd integers to f(1), both of which are 0. Therefore, for any integer x, f(x) = 0. But does this hold for non-integer x as well?Wait, the problem states that f is defined on all real numbers. So even if x is not an integer, the function is periodic with period 2 and odd. But if f is periodic with period 2 and odd, then f(x + 2) = f(x), and f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s see what that implies.Take any x, then f(x + 2) = f(x). Also, f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s see if this implies f is identically zero.Wait, suppose f is any function that is both odd and periodic with period 2. Then, for any x, f(x + 2) = f(x), and f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s see what f(1) is.f(1) = f(1 + 2k) for any integer k. But also, f(1) = f(1 - 0) = f(0 + 1) = f(0 + 1) = f(1). Wait, perhaps not helpful. Let&#39;s use the two properties.Let x be any real number. Then, f(x + 2) = f(x). Also, f(-x) = -f(x). Let&#39;s combine these:f(x + 2) = f(x) = f(-x - 2) because f is periodic. Wait, no, f(-x - 2) = f(-(x + 2)) = -f(x + 2) = -f(x). But also, f(-x - 2) = f(-x - 2 + 2*1) = f(-x). Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x). So it&#39;s consistent.But does this force f(x) to be zero everywhere? Not necessarily. For example, consider f(x) = sin(πx). Let&#39;s check if this function satisfies the given conditions.First, is it odd? Yes, sin(-πx) = -sin(πx).Does it satisfy f(x) = f(1 - x)?Compute f(1 - x) = sin(π(1 - x)) = sin(π - πx) = sin(πx) because sin(π - θ) = sinθ. Wait, sin(π - θ) = sinθ, so sin(π - πx) = sin(πx). Therefore, f(1 - x) = sin(πx) = f(x). So yes, sin(πx) satisfies f(x) = f(1 - x). Also, it&#39;s periodic with period 2, since sin(π(x + 2)) = sin(πx + 2π) = sin(πx). So indeed, sin(πx) is a function that is odd, periodic with period 2, and satisfies f(x) = f(1 - x). But sin(πx) is not identically zero. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that f(2010) = 0 must hold regardless of the specific function, but sin(πx) evaluated at 2010 is sin(2010π) = sin(0) = 0 because 2010 is an integer. So indeed, even though the function isn&#39;t zero everywhere, f(2010) would still be zero.Therefore, even if the function isn&#39;t zero everywhere, for integer arguments, since they are multiples of the period divided by 2 (period 2), we have that f(n) = f(0) for even n and f(n) = f(1) for odd n. But since f(0) = 0 and f(1) = -f(0) = 0, then f(n) = 0 for all integers n. So even though the function can be non-zero elsewhere, at integer points it must be zero.Therefore, f(2010) = 0.So the answer is 0.Final AnswerThe value of ( f(2010) ) is boxed{0}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on (mathbf{R}) and satisfies ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ), we need to find ( f(2010) ).1. Odd Function Property: ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for all ( x in mathbf{R} ).2. Functional Equation: ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ) for all ( x in mathbf{R} ).Using the functional equation:[ f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009) ]Using the odd function property:[ f(-2009) = -f(2009) ]Thus:[ f(2010) = -f(2009) ]Applying the functional equation again to ( f(2009) ):[ f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008) ]Using the odd function property:[ f(-2008) = -f(2008) ]Thus:[ f(2009) = -f(2008) ][ f(2010) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008) ]Repeating this process, we observe that:[ f(2010) = f(2008) = f(2006) = cdots ]This pattern shows that the function ( f ) is periodic with period 2. Therefore:[ f(2010) = f(0) ]For an odd function, ( f(0) = 0 ). Hence:[ f(2010) = 0 ]Thus, the value of ( f(2010) ) is (boxed{0}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have an odd function f(x) defined on all real numbers, and it also satisfies the equation f(x) = f(1 - x). We need to find f(2010). Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. That&#39;s the definition. So, if I plug in -x into the function, it&#39;s the same as the negative of the function evaluated at x.Now, the function also has this symmetry: f(x) = f(1 - x). So, for any x, the value of the function at x is equal to its value at 1 - x. That seems like a reflection or a shift symmetry. Let me write that down:f(x) = f(1 - x).If I replace x with (1 - x) in the equation, what happens? Let&#39;s check:f(1 - x) = f(1 - (1 - x)) = f(x). So, that just gives the same equation back. Hmm, maybe we need another approach.Since the function is odd, we can use that property along with the given equation to find some relationships. Let&#39;s try to combine both properties. Let&#39;s first substitute x with -x in the given equation. Since f is odd, f(-x) = -f(x). So, substituting x with -x in f(x) = f(1 - x), we get:f(-x) = f(1 - (-x)) =&gt; -f(x) = f(1 + x).So, from this, we have that -f(x) = f(1 + x). Let me write that down as equation (1):(1) -f(x) = f(1 + x).Now, let&#39;s also recall the original functional equation f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s try to find another relationship here. Maybe we can shift x by some amount and see what happens.Suppose we replace x with (x + 1) in equation (1). Then we get:-f(x + 1) = f(1 + (x + 1)) = f(x + 2).But from equation (1), we know that -f(x) = f(1 + x). Therefore, -f(x + 1) = f(x + 2) becomes:-(-f(x)) = f(x + 2) =&gt; f(x) = f(x + 2).Wait, so this suggests that f is periodic with period 2? Because f(x) = f(x + 2). So, the function repeats every 2 units. That&#39;s interesting. So, the function is periodic with period 2. Let me verify that.If f(x) = f(x + 2), then yes, the period is 2. So, every 2 units, the function repeats its values. Therefore, for any integer k, f(x + 2k) = f(x). So, if we can express 2010 as some multiple of 2 plus a remainder, then f(2010) would be equal to f(remainder). But 2010 divided by 2 is 1005 with no remainder. So, 2010 is 2*1005, so f(2010) = f(0). Wait, but f(0) for an odd function. Hmm, let&#39;s recall that for an odd function, f(-0) = -f(0), but -0 is 0, so f(0) = -f(0), which implies that f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(0) = 0. Therefore, if f is periodic with period 2, then f(2010) = f(0) = 0. But wait, is this correct? Let me check.Wait, so we derived that f(x) = f(x + 2). But how did we derive that? Let me recap.We started with f(x) = f(1 - x) (given). Then, using the oddness, we found that -f(x) = f(1 + x) (equation 1). Then, replacing x with x + 1 in equation 1, we get -f(x + 1) = f(x + 2). But from equation 1, we have -f(x) = f(x + 1), so substituting that into -f(x + 1) = f(x + 2), gives -(-f(x)) = f(x + 2) =&gt; f(x) = f(x + 2). So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the function is periodic with period 2.Therefore, f(2010) = f(0) because 2010 is 0 mod 2. And since f is odd, f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0. So, the answer is 0. But let me check this again.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another way to approach this. Let&#39;s see.Given that f(x) is odd and f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s set x = 2010. Then f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009). But because f is odd, f(-2009) = -f(2009). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009).But then, can we express f(2009) in terms of another value? Let&#39;s try to apply the functional equation again. For x = 2009, f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008). Then, since f is odd, f(-2008) = -f(2008). Therefore, f(2009) = -f(2008). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008).Similarly, applying the same logic to f(2008), we have f(2008) = f(1 - 2008) = f(-2007) = -f(2007). Then f(2008) = -f(2007), so f(2010) = f(2008) = -f(2007). Continuing this pattern, each time we subtract 1 from the argument, alternating signs.But this seems like a long process. However, notice that each time we subtract 2 from the argument, the sign remains the same. For example:f(2010) = f(2010 - 2*1) = f(2008) [since period is 2], but earlier we found that f(2010) = f(2008). Wait, but if the period is 2, then f(2010) = f(2008) = f(2006) = ... = f(0). But then again, since the period is 2, f(2010) = f(0). And since it&#39;s odd, f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.Alternatively, let&#39;s check using the periodicity. Since we concluded that the function is periodic with period 2, and that f(0) = 0, then indeed f(2010) = f(0 + 2*1005) = f(0) = 0.But let&#39;s also check if there&#39;s any inconsistency here. Suppose we take x = 0.5. Then according to the functional equation, f(0.5) = f(1 - 0.5) = f(0.5). So, that&#39;s trivial. But using the oddness, f(-0.5) = -f(0.5). But using the functional equation for x = -0.5, f(-0.5) = f(1 - (-0.5)) = f(1.5). Therefore, f(1.5) = -f(0.5). But also, since the period is 2, f(1.5) = f(1.5 - 2) = f(-0.5) = -f(0.5). So, that&#39;s consistent. So, no contradictions here.Another example: Let x = 1. Then f(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) = 0. So, f(1) = 0. Then, using the periodicity, f(1) = f(1 + 2k) = 0 for any integer k. So, f(3) = 0, f(5) = 0, etc. Also, using oddness, f(-1) = -f(1) = 0. Similarly, f(-1 + 2k) = 0. So, all odd integers have f(x) = 0? Wait, not exactly. The function is zero at integers? Wait, perhaps not necessarily. Wait, if x is an integer, let&#39;s see.Suppose x is an integer. Let x = n where n is integer. Then f(n) = f(1 - n). But since f is odd, f(1 - n) = -f(n - 1). Therefore, f(n) = -f(n - 1). So, we get the recurrence relation f(n) = -f(n - 1). Therefore, this suggests that f(n) = (-1)^n f(0). But f(0) = 0, so f(n) = 0 for all integers n. Therefore, if n is an integer, f(n) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.Wait, that&#39;s another way to see it. If we can show that all integers are mapped to zero, then f(2010) = 0.Let me check this. Let&#39;s suppose n is an integer. Then f(n) = f(1 - n). But since f is odd, f(1 - n) = -f(n - 1). Therefore:f(n) = -f(n - 1).So, we have a recurrence relation: f(n) = -f(n - 1). Let&#39;s solve this. Starting from n = 1:f(1) = -f(0) = -0 = 0.Then f(2) = -f(1) = -0 = 0.Similarly, f(3) = -f(2) = 0.Continuing, all integers n have f(n) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.Therefore, the answer is 0.So, to recap, two approaches lead us to the conclusion that f(2010) = 0. First, using periodicity of 2 and the fact that f(0) = 0. Second, using the recurrence relation for integer arguments, showing that all integers map to 0. Both methods confirm that the answer is 0.But let me ensure there are no gaps here. The key steps were:1. Using the given functional equation and the oddness to derive that f(x) is periodic with period 2.2. Using that periodicity to reduce f(2010) to f(0) = 0.Alternatively, considering integer arguments and using the recurrence relation derived from the functional equation and oddness to show f(n) = 0 for all integers n.Both approaches are valid. The first approach uses the periodicity to reduce the argument modulo 2, while the second approach uses the properties at integer points.Therefore, the answer is 0.Final Answerboxed{0}&lt;/think&gt;Given an odd function ( f(x) ) defined on (mathbf{R}) that satisfies ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ), we need to find ( f(2010) ).1. Odd Function Property: ( f(-x) = -f(x) ).2. Functional Equation: ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ).By substituting ( -x ) into the functional equation:[f(-x) = f(1 + x)]Using the odd function property:[-f(x) = f(1 + x)]Next, substituting ( x + 1 ) into the derived equation:[-f(x + 1) = f(x + 2)]From the previous result, ( -f(x) = f(x + 1) ), so:[-(-f(x)) = f(x + 2) implies f(x) = f(x + 2)]This shows ( f(x) ) is periodic with period 2.Since ( f(x) ) is periodic with period 2:[f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2) = f(0)]For an odd function, ( f(0) = 0 ). Therefore:[f(2010) = f(0) = 0]Additionally, considering integer arguments, we derived the recurrence relation:[f(n) = -f(n - 1)]Starting from ( f(0) = 0 ), all integer values ( f(n) = 0 ).Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{0}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the value of f(2010) given that f(x) is an odd function defined on all real numbers and it also satisfies the equation f(x) = f(1 - x). Hmm, odd function, so that means f(-x) = -f(x). And the functional equation f(x) = f(1 - x). Let me try to work through this step by step.First, since f is odd, I know that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x. So, for any x, replacing x with -x gives me f(-x) = -f(x). That&#39;s a key property of odd functions. Now, the other condition given is f(x) = f(1 - x). Let me try to see if I can combine these two properties to find some relationship or maybe a periodicity in the function.Let&#39;s write down the given equations again:1. f(x) = f(1 - x) (from the problem statement)2. f(-x) = -f(x) (since f is odd)Let me substitute x with some expression in these equations to see if I can relate them. Maybe substitute x with 1 - x in the odd function property? Let&#39;s try that.If I replace x with 1 - x in the second equation (the odd function property), I get:f(-(1 - x)) = -f(1 - x)Simplifying the left side:f(-1 + x) = -f(1 - x)But from the first equation, f(1 - x) = f(x). So substituting that in:f(-1 + x) = -f(x)Hmm, so f(x - 1) = -f(x). Wait, x - 1 is the same as -1 + x, so f(x - 1) = -f(x). That&#39;s interesting. Let me write that down:f(x - 1) = -f(x)Now, this seems like a recursive relationship. If I can express f(x - 1) in terms of f(x), maybe I can iterate this or find a pattern. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s try to shift x by 1 again. If I replace x with x + 1 in the equation f(x - 1) = -f(x), then:f((x + 1) - 1) = -f(x + 1)Simplifying:f(x) = -f(x + 1)So, this gives us another equation:f(x) = -f(x + 1)Which can be rewritten as:f(x + 1) = -f(x)Okay, so now we have f(x + 1) = -f(x). Let me write that down. This is a functional equation that relates the function at x + 1 to the function at x. If I can find a pattern here, maybe I can find a period or something.If f(x + 1) = -f(x), then what happens if we apply this equation again? Let&#39;s replace x with x + 1:f(x + 1 + 1) = -f(x + 1)Which simplifies to:f(x + 2) = -f(x + 1)But from the previous equation, f(x + 1) = -f(x), so substituting that in:f(x + 2) = -(-f(x)) = f(x)So, f(x + 2) = f(x). That means the function is periodic with period 2. So, the function repeats every 2 units. Therefore, f is periodic with period 2.But wait, f is also an odd function. Let me confirm if that&#39;s consistent. If f has period 2 and is odd, then:f(-x) = -f(x) (oddness)But also, f(x + 2) = f(x) (periodicity). So, for example, f(-x) = f(-x + 2), but also f(-x) = -f(x). So, putting those together:f(-x + 2) = -f(x)But since f is periodic with period 2, f(-x + 2) = f(-x + 2 - 2) = f(-x). Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe I need to check another value.Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can use these properties to find f(2010). Since f is periodic with period 2, then f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2). Let&#39;s calculate 2010 divided by 2. 2010 divided by 2 is 1005 with a remainder of 0, so 2010 mod 2 is 0. Therefore, f(2010) = f(0). But wait, f is an odd function. For an odd function, f(0) must be 0, because f(-0) = -f(0), but f(-0) = f(0), so f(0) = -f(0), which implies f(0) = 0.Therefore, f(2010) = f(0) = 0. Is that the answer? Let me verify this step-by-step to make sure I didn&#39;t skip anything.First, let&#39;s verify that the function has period 2. We started with the given conditions:1. f(x) = f(1 - x)2. f(-x) = -f(x)Then, substituting x with 1 - x in the odd function property:f(-(1 - x)) = -f(1 - x) =&gt; f(x - 1) = -f(1 - x). But since f(1 - x) = f(x), we get f(x - 1) = -f(x). Then, replacing x with x + 1:f((x + 1) - 1) = -f(x + 1) =&gt; f(x) = -f(x + 1), so f(x + 1) = -f(x). Then, substituting again:f(x + 2) = -f(x + 1) = -(-f(x)) = f(x). Therefore, periodicity of 2. That seems correct.Therefore, since the function has period 2, f(2010) is equal to f(0). But since f is an odd function, f(0) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.But let me check another way. Let&#39;s use the original functional equation f(x) = f(1 - x). Let&#39;s compute f(2010). From the functional equation, f(2010) = f(1 - 2010) = f(-2009). Since f is odd, f(-2009) = -f(2009). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009). Now, apply the functional equation again to f(2009):f(2009) = f(1 - 2009) = f(-2008). Then, since f is odd, f(-2008) = -f(2008). So, f(2009) = -f(2008). Therefore, f(2010) = -f(2009) = -(-f(2008)) = f(2008).Similarly, applying this recursively, f(2010) = f(2008) = f(2006) = ... all the way down. Since 2010 is even, we can keep subtracting 2 until we get to 0. So, 2010 - 2*1005 = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = f(0) = 0. So that confirms it again.Another approach: using the periodicity. Since the function is periodic with period 2, then f(2010) = f(2010 - 2*1005) = f(0) = 0. So that&#39;s another way to see it.Wait a second, is the periodicity established correctly? Let&#39;s confirm once again. Starting from f(x + 2) = f(x). So, adding 2 to x brings us back to the original value, hence period 2. So yes, the function repeats every 2 units. Therefore, f(2010) is same as f(0), and f(0) is 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.But just to make sure, let&#39;s check with a smaller number. Suppose we take x = 1. Then, according to the functional equation, f(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) = 0. Also, since f is odd, f(-1) = -f(1) = -0 = 0. Then, using periodicity, f(1 + 2k) = f(1) = 0 for any integer k. Similarly, f(0 + 2k) = f(0) = 0. So, all even integers map to 0, and all odd integers map to 0 as well. Wait, but that seems like the function is zero at all integers. But our function is defined for all real numbers. However, the problem only asks for f(2010), which is an integer. But even if the function is non-zero elsewhere, at integer points it&#39;s zero. Let me check.Suppose x is an integer, say n. Then f(n) = f(1 - n) because of the functional equation. Also, since f is odd, f(1 - n) = -f(n - 1). Therefore, f(n) = -f(n - 1). So, this recurrence relation is f(n) = -f(n - 1). Let&#39;s start with n = 1: f(1) = -f(0) = -0 = 0. Then, n = 2: f(2) = -f(1) = -0 = 0. n = 3: f(3) = -f(2) = -0 = 0. So, by induction, all integers n will have f(n) = 0. Therefore, f(2010) = 0.Therefore, regardless of the approach—using periodicity, using the functional equation recursively, or using properties of odd functions—the conclusion is that f(2010) equals 0. Thus, the answer should be 0.Final Answerboxed{0}&lt;/think&gt;Given that ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on (mathbf{R}) and satisfies ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ), we need to find ( f(2010) ).1. Odd Function Property: ( f(-x) = -f(x) ).2. Functional Equation: ( f(x) = f(1 - x) ).By substituting ( x ) with ( 1 - x ) in the odd function property, we get:[ f(-(1 - x)) = -f(1 - x) ]Simplifying, we have:[ f(x - 1) = -f(1 - x) ]Using the functional equation ( f(1 - x) = f(x) ), we get:[ f(x - 1) = -f(x) ]Replacing ( x ) with ( x + 1 ) in the equation ( f(x - 1) = -f(x) ), we get:[ f((x + 1) - 1) = -f(x + 1) ]Simplifying, we have:[ f(x) = -f(x + 1) ]Thus, ( f(x + 1) = -f(x) ).Replacing ( x ) with ( x + 1 ) again, we get:[ f(x + 2) = -f(x + 1) ]Substituting ( f(x + 1) = -f(x) ), we get:[ f(x + 2) = -(-f(x)) = f(x) ]This shows that ( f ) is periodic with period 2.Since ( f ) is periodic with period 2, ( f(2010) = f(2010 mod 2) ). Calculating ( 2010 mod 2 ), we get 0. Therefore, ( f(2010) = f(0) ).For an odd function, ( f(0) = 0 ). Hence, ( f(2010) = 0 ).[boxed{0}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9152f154></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>🔑:</span>begin{array}{l}f(0)=0, f(x+1)=f(-x)=-f(x) .end{array}From the conditions, we have f(x+2)=f(x), which means f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2.Therefore, f(2010)=f(0)=0.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-1974eff5 data-v-9152f154><div class="review" data-v-9152f154><div class="review-title" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>❓:</span>6.

I need to solve this system of equations with positive real numbers x, y, z. The equations are:1/(xy) = x/z + 1,1/(yz) = y/x + 1,1/(zx) = z/y + 1.Hmm, all three equations look kind of similar. Maybe there&#39;s some symmetry here. Let me write them again more clearly:1) 1/(xy) = x/z + 1,2) 1/(yz) = y/x + 1,3) 1/(zx) = z/y + 1.Since they&#39;re symmetric, maybe the solution has x = y = z? Let me check that first. If x = y = z, then let&#39;s substitute into the first equation:1/(x*x) = x/x + 1 =&gt; 1/x² = 1 + 1 =&gt; 1/x² = 2 =&gt; x² = 1/2 =&gt; x = 1/√2.But since they are positive real numbers, that&#39;s valid. Let me check if this satisfies all equations.First equation: 1/(x*x) = 2, and x/z +1 = 1 +1 = 2. So yes, works.Second equation: 1/(x*x) = 2, and y/x +1 = 1 +1 =2. Also works.Third equation: same as the first. So x = y = z = 1/√2 is a solution. But is this the only solution?Wait, maybe there are other solutions where variables are not equal. Let&#39;s see. Since the equations are cyclic, maybe we can assume some ratios between x, y, z?Let me denote variables as ratios. Let me set x = a, y = b*a, z = c*a. Then, since x, y, z are positive, a, b, c are positive. Maybe substituting variables like this can reduce the system.So x = a, y = b*a, z = c*a.Then, substitute into equations:First equation: 1/(x y) = 1/(a * b a) = 1/(a² b) = x/z +1 = a / (c a) +1 = 1/c +1.So equation 1 becomes 1/(a² b) = 1/c +1.Second equation: 1/(y z) = 1/(b a * c a) = 1/(b c a²) = y/x +1 = (b a)/a +1 = b +1.So equation 2: 1/(b c a²) = b +1.Third equation: 1/(z x) = 1/(c a * a) = 1/(c a²) = z/y +1 = (c a)/(b a) +1 = c/b +1.Equation 3: 1/(c a²) = c/b +1.Now, equations 1, 2, 3 become:1) 1/(a² b) = 1/c +1,2) 1/(b c a²) = b +1,3) 1/(c a²) = c/b +1.Let me see if we can express variables in terms of a, b, c. Let me note that from equation 1: 1/(a² b) = (1 + c)/c, so 1/(a² b) = (1 + c)/c. Then, cross-multiplying: c = a² b (1 + c).Similarly, equation 3: 1/(c a²) = (c + b)/b. So 1/(c a²) = (c + b)/b. Cross-multiplying: b = c a² (c + b).Equation 2: 1/(b c a²) = b +1. So 1/(b c a²) = b +1. Let&#39;s see if we can connect these equations.Alternatively, maybe express a² from equation 1. From equation 1: c = a² b (1 + c) =&gt; a² = c / [b (1 + c)].Similarly, from equation 3: b = c a² (c + b). Substitute a² from equation 1:b = c * [c / (b (1 + c))] * (c + b).Simplify:b = c * [c / (b (1 + c))] * (c + b)Multiply terms:b = [c² (c + b)] / [b (1 + c)]Multiply both sides by b (1 + c):b² (1 + c) = c² (c + b)Hmm, this looks complicated. Let me expand both sides:Left side: b² + b² cRight side: c³ + b c²So:b² + b² c = c³ + b c²Bring all terms to left:b² + b² c - c³ - b c² = 0Factor terms:Hmm, maybe factor by grouping.Take b² terms and the rest:b² (1 + c) - c² (c + b) = 0But that&#39;s how we arrived here. Alternatively, rearrange:b² - c³ + b² c - b c² = 0Hmm, perhaps factor terms with b² and -c³:b²(1 + c) - c²(c + b) = 0Alternatively, factor out c from the last two terms?Wait, maybe:b²(1 + c) - c²(b + c) = 0Let me write this as:b²(1 + c) = c²(b + c)Divide both sides by c²:(b² / c²)(1 + c) = b + cLet me denote k = b / c. Then, b = k c.Substitute into the equation:(k² c² / c²)(1 + c) = k c + cSimplify:k² (1 + c) = c(k + 1)Hmm, now express in terms of k:k² (1 + c) = c(k + 1)But this still has both k and c. Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps define another variable. Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can find a relation between b and c.Alternatively, let&#39;s look at equation 2.From equation 2: 1/(b c a²) = b +1.But from equation 1, a² = c / [b (1 + c)]. Substitute into equation 2:1 / [b c * (c / (b (1 + c)))] = b +1Simplify denominator:b c * [c / (b (1 + c))] = [b c * c] / [b (1 + c)] = c² / (1 + c)Therefore, 1 / [c² / (1 + c)] = (1 + c)/c² = b +1So equation 2 gives: (1 + c)/c² = b +1 =&gt; b = (1 + c)/c² -1 = (1 + c - c²)/c²So b = (1 + c - c²)/c²Hmm, so we can express b in terms of c. Let&#39;s denote that.Similarly, from equation 1 and 3, we might have another relation. Let&#39;s see.From equation 3: 1/(c a²) = c/b +1Again, from equation 1: a² = c / [b (1 + c)]So substitute into equation 3:1 / [c * (c / (b (1 + c)))] = c/b +1Simplify denominator:c * [c / (b (1 + c))] = c² / [b (1 + c)]Therefore, 1 / [c² / (b (1 + c))] = (b (1 + c))/c² = c/b +1So:(b (1 + c))/c² = c/b +1Multiply both sides by c² b to eliminate denominators:b^2 (1 + c) = c^3 + b c²Wait, this is the same equation as we had earlier. So that&#39;s consistent.But since we already have b expressed in terms of c from equation 2, let&#39;s substitute that into this equation.From equation 2, b = (1 + c - c²)/c²Substitute into the equation:(b (1 + c))/c² = c/b +1Left side: [ (1 + c - c²)/c² * (1 + c) ] / c² = (1 + c - c²)(1 + c) / c^4Right side: c / [ (1 + c - c²)/c² ] +1 = c * c² / (1 + c - c²) +1 = c³ / (1 + c - c²) +1So equation becomes:(1 + c - c²)(1 + c)/c^4 = c³/(1 + c - c²) +1This looks quite complicated. Let&#39;s compute left side and right side.First, let&#39;s compute left side numerator: (1 + c - c²)(1 + c)Multiply out:(1)(1 + c) + c(1 + c) - c²(1 + c)= (1 + c) + c + c² - c² - c³Simplify:1 + c + c + c² - c² - c³ = 1 + 2c - c³Therefore, left side: (1 + 2c - c³)/c^4Right side: c³/(1 + c - c²) +1 = [c³ + (1 + c - c²)] / (1 + c - c²) = [c³ +1 + c - c²]/(1 + c - c²)Simplify numerator: c³ - c² + c +1Factor numerator: Let&#39;s see if c³ - c² + c +1 can be factored.Try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1.Test c=1: 1 -1 +1 +1 =2 ≠0Test c=-1: -1 -1 -1 +1= -2≠0. So no rational roots. Maybe factor by grouping:c³ -c² +c +1 = c²(c -1) +1(c +1). Not helpful.Alternatively, write as c³ +1 -c² +c = (c³ +1) + (-c² +c) = (c+1)(c² -c +1) + c(-c +1). Not sure. Maybe not factorable easily.So the equation is:(1 + 2c - c³)/c^4 = (c³ - c² + c +1)/(1 + c - c²)Cross-multiplying:(1 + 2c - c³)(1 + c - c²) = c^4 (c³ - c² + c +1)This is going to be messy, but let&#39;s expand both sides.First, left side:(1 + 2c - c³)(1 + c - c²)Multiply term by term:1*(1) +1*c +1*(-c²) +2c*(1) +2c*c +2c*(-c²) + (-c³)*(1) + (-c³)*c + (-c³)*(-c²)= 1 + c - c² +2c +2c² -2c³ -c³ -c⁴ +c⁵Combine like terms:Constants:1c terms: c +2c =3cc² terms: -c² +2c² =c²c³ terms: -2c³ -c³ =-3c³c⁴ terms: -c⁴c⁵ terms: +c⁵So left side: c⁵ -c⁴ -3c³ +c² +3c +1Right side: c^4 (c³ -c² +c +1) =c^7 -c^6 +c^5 +c^4Therefore, equation is:c⁵ -c⁴ -3c³ +c² +3c +1 = c^7 -c^6 +c^5 +c^4Bring all terms to left side:c⁵ -c⁴ -3c³ +c² +3c +1 -c^7 +c^6 -c^5 -c^4=0Simplify:-c^7 +c^6 +0c^5 +(-c⁴ -c⁴) + (-3c³) +c² +3c +1= -c^7 +c^6 -2c⁴ -3c³ +c² +3c +1=0Multiply both sides by -1:c^7 -c^6 +2c⁴ +3c³ -c² -3c -1=0So we have a 7th degree polynomial equation:c^7 -c^6 +2c⁴ +3c³ -c² -3c -1=0This seems really complicated. Maybe we can factor it or find rational roots.Possible rational roots are ±1. Let&#39;s test c=1:1 -1 +2 +3 -1 -3 -1= (1-1)+(2+3-3)+(-1-1)=0+2-2=0. Hey, c=1 is a root!So (c -1) is a factor. Let&#39;s perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Divide c^7 -c^6 +2c⁴ +3c³ -c² -3c -1 by (c -1).Using synthetic division for root c=1:Coefficients: 1 (c^7), -1 (c^6), 0 (c^5), 2 (c^4), 3 (c^3), -1 (c^2), -3 (c), -1 (constant)Write coefficients: 1, -1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -3, -1Bring down 1.Multiply by 1: 1.Add to next coefficient: -1 +1=0.Multiply by1:0.Add to next coefficient:0 +0=0.Multiply by1:0.Add to next coefficient:2 +0=2.Multiply by1:2.Add to next coefficient:3 +2=5.Multiply by1:5.Add to next coefficient:-1 +5=4.Multiply by1:4.Add to next coefficient:-3 +4=1.Multiply by1:1.Add to last coefficient:-1 +1=0.So the result is coefficients:1,0,0,2,5,4,1, and remainder 0. Therefore, the polynomial factors as (c -1)(c^6 +0c^5 +0c^4 +2c³ +5c² +4c +1).So now, we have:(c -1)(c^6 +2c³ +5c² +4c +1)=0Since c is a positive real number, c=1 is a possible solution. Let&#39;s check c=1.If c=1, then from equation 2: b=(1 +c -c²)/c²=(1 +1 -1)/1=(1)/1=1. So b=1.Then, from equation 1: a² = c/(b(1 +c))=1/(1*(1 +1))=1/2. So a=1/√2.Therefore, x=a=1/√2, y=b*a=1*1/√2=1/√2, z=c*a=1*1/√2=1/√2. Which is the solution we found earlier. So c=1 gives the symmetric solution.Now, we need to check if there are other positive real roots of the equation c^6 +2c³ +5c² +4c +1=0. But since all coefficients are positive and c&gt;0, each term c^6, 2c³,5c²,4c,1 is positive, so their sum cannot be zero. Therefore, the only positive real root is c=1.Therefore, the only solution in positive real numbers is c=1, which gives x=y=z=1/√2.Wait, but before we conclude, let&#39;s just make sure there are no other possible c. For example, if the polynomial c^6 +2c³ +5c² +4c +1=0 had any positive roots, but as I just thought, since all terms are positive for c&gt;0, their sum cannot be zero. So, indeed, the only positive real solution is c=1.Therefore, the only solution is x=y=z=1/√2. Let me check once more in the original equations.First equation: 1/(xy) =1/( (1/√2)(1/√2) )=1/(1/2)=2. And x/z +1= (1/√2)/(1/√2)+1=1+1=2. Correct.Second equation:1/(yz)= same as first, 2. y/x +1=1+1=2. Correct.Third equation: same as others. So yes, all equations are satisfied.Therefore, the solution is x=y=z=1/√2.But maybe there are other solutions where variables are not equal? But according to the polynomial, there&#39;s no other positive real solution. So the only solution is the symmetric one.Final AnswerThe solution is boxed{dfrac{1}{sqrt{2}}} for each variable (x), (y), and (z).&lt;/think&gt;Given the system of equations for positive real numbers (x), (y), and (z):1. (frac{1}{xy} = frac{x}{z} + 1)2. (frac{1}{yz} = frac{y}{x} + 1)3. (frac{1}{zx} = frac{z}{y} + 1)We first check if there is a symmetric solution where (x = y = z). Substituting (x = y = z) into the first equation:[frac{1}{x^2} = frac{x}{x} + 1 implies frac{1}{x^2} = 1 + 1 implies frac{1}{x^2} = 2 implies x^2 = frac{1}{2} implies x = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}]We verify that (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) satisfies all three equations:- For the first equation: (frac{1}{(frac{1}{sqrt{2}})(frac{1}{sqrt{2}})} = 2) and (frac{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} + 1 = 2).- Similarly, the second and third equations also hold true.Next, we consider the possibility of non-symmetric solutions. By substituting (x = a), (y = ba), and (z = ca) into the equations and simplifying, we derive a polynomial equation in terms of (c). After factoring and checking for positive real roots, we find that the only positive real root is (c = 1), leading to (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}).Thus, the only solution in positive real numbers is:[boxed{dfrac{1}{sqrt{2}}}] for each variable (x), (y), and (z).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have this system of three equations with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. The equations are:1. 1/(xy) = x/z + 12. 1/(yz) = y/x + 13. 1/(zx) = z/y + 1Hmm. So, each equation has a reciprocal of a product of two variables on the left side, and on the right side, there&#39;s a ratio of two variables plus 1. It seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe there&#39;s a substitution or symmetry in the variables that I can exploit.First, maybe I can rewrite the equations to make them look more manageable. Let&#39;s start with the first equation:1/(xy) = x/z + 1Multiply both sides by xy to eliminate the denominator:1 = x^2 y / z + xySimilarly, do the same for the other equations. Let&#39;s process each equation one by one.Equation 1:1 = (x^2 y)/z + xyEquation 2:1/(yz) = y/x + 1Multiply both sides by yz:1 = y^2 z / x + yzEquation 3:1/(zx) = z/y + 1Multiply both sides by zx:1 = z^2 x / y + zxSo now, the system is:1. 1 = (x²y)/z + xy2. 1 = (y²z)/x + yz3. 1 = (z²x)/y + zxHmm. These equations still look a bit complicated, but there&#39;s a cyclic symmetry here. Each equation has a term with the square of one variable times another, divided by the third, plus the product of two variables.I wonder if assuming that x = y = z could work? Let me test that. If x = y = z = k, then substituting into the first equation:1/(k*k) = k/k + 1 =&gt; 1/k² = 1 + 1 =&gt; 1/k² = 2 =&gt; k² = 1/2 =&gt; k = 1/√2Then check if this satisfies all three equations. Let&#39;s check equation 1:1/( (1/√2)*(1/√2) ) = (1/√2)/ (1/√2) + 1 =&gt; 1/(1/2) = 1 + 1 =&gt; 2 = 2. That works. Similarly, equation 2 and 3 would be the same, so yes, x = y = z = 1/√2 is a solution. But wait, the problem says &quot;positive real numbers,&quot; so this is a valid solution. But is this the only solution?Wait, maybe there are other solutions where x, y, z are not equal. Let me check.Suppose that x, y, z are not all equal. Then maybe there&#39;s another symmetry. For example, maybe x, y, z are in a certain ratio. Let me consider variables in proportion.Let me denote variables as follows: Let’s say x = a, y = b, z = c.Looking at the equations, they cycle through x, y, z. So equation 1 relates x, y, z; equation 2 relates y, z, x; equation 3 relates z, x, y. So cyclic permutations. Therefore, maybe if we assume x = y = z, we have a solution, but perhaps there are others.But before considering other solutions, let&#39;s verify if x = y = z is the only solution.Alternatively, maybe by substituting variables.Let’s try to express each variable in terms of another. Let me consider equation 1:1 = (x² y)/z + xy. Let&#39;s factor out xy:1 = xy (x/z + 1)But from the original first equation, 1/(xy) = x/z + 1, so substituting back, we get 1 = xy*(1/(xy)) = 1. Hmm, that&#39;s just confirming the equation, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe express x/z from the first equation.From equation 1: x/z = 1/(xy) - 1Similarly, from equation 2: y/x = 1/(yz) - 1From equation 3: z/y = 1/(zx) - 1So, let&#39;s write these as:Equation 1: x/z = (1 - xy)/xyWait, wait. Let me re-express equation 1 again:Starting from 1/(xy) = x/z + 1So x/z = 1/(xy) - 1Similarly, equation 2: y/x = 1/(yz) - 1Equation 3: z/y = 1/(zx) - 1So, we have:x/z = (1 - xy)/xy  --&gt; From equation 1Similarly, equation 2: y/x = (1 - yz)/yzEquation 3: z/y = (1 - zx)/zxPerhaps we can create a chain of substitutions here.Let’s denote A = x/y, B = y/z, C = z/x. Then A*B*C = (x/y)*(y/z)*(z/x) = 1. But not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe let’s express each ratio in terms of variables.From equation 1: x/z = (1 - xy)/xyFrom equation 2: y/x = (1 - yz)/yzFrom equation 3: z/y = (1 - zx)/zxLet’s write equation 1 as x/z = (1/(xy) - 1)Similarly, equation 2: y/x = (1/(yz) - 1)Equation 3: z/y = (1/(zx) - 1)If we multiply all three equations together:(x/z) * (y/x) * (z/y) = [ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ]Left side: (x/z)*(y/x)*(z/y) = 1So, 1 = [ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ]Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe expanding the right side would lead somewhere.First, let me write each term:Term1: (1/(xy) - 1) = (1 - xy)/xySimilarly, Term2: (1/(yz) - 1) = (1 - yz)/yzTerm3: (1/(zx) - 1) = (1 - zx)/zxTherefore, the product is:[(1 - xy)/xy] * [(1 - yz)/yz] * [(1 - zx)/zx] = [(1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx)] / (x y z)^2 * (1/(x y z)) )? Wait, no:Wait, Term1 is (1 - xy)/xy, Term2 is (1 - yz)/yz, Term3 is (1 - zx)/zx. So multiplying them together:[(1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx)] / (xy * yz * zx) ) = [(1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx)] / (x^2 y^2 z^2 )So, since left side is 1, we have:[(1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx)] = x^2 y^2 z^2This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can substitute variables. Let me set a = xy, b = yz, c = zx. Then, since x, y, z are positive, a, b, c are positive as well.Note that:a = xyb = yzc = zxThen, we can express variables in terms of a, b, c:Multiplying a, b, c: abc = x y * y z * z x = x^2 y^2 z^2 =&gt; xyz = sqrt(abc)But maybe not necessary. Let me see.Our previous equation becomes:(1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = (a b c)^2But also, note that from a = xy, b = yz, c = zx, we can relate a, b, c.From a = xy and c = zx, dividing a by c gives (xy)/(zx) = y/z = a/c. Similarly, from b = yz and a = xy, dividing b by a gives z/x = b/a. Similarly, from c = zx and b = yz, dividing c by b gives x/y = c/b.So, perhaps we can express ratios in terms of a, b, c.But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of a, b, c.Given a = xy, b = yz, c = zx, then:x = sqrt( (a c)/b )Wait, let&#39;s see:From a = xy and c = zx, multiplying them: a c = x^2 y zBut y z = b, so a c = x^2 b =&gt; x^2 = (a c)/b =&gt; x = sqrt( (a c)/b )Similarly, y = sqrt( (a b)/c )z = sqrt( (b c)/a )Hmm, so variables can be expressed in terms of a, b, c. But not sure if this helps. Maybe substitute back into the original equations.Alternatively, given that a, b, c are related through the equation (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = (a b c)^2, but I still don&#39;t see a straightforward path.Alternatively, let&#39;s note that in the case where x = y = z = 1/√2, then a = xy = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, similarly b = yz = 1/2, c = zx = 1/2. Then (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = (1 - 1/2)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and (a b c)^2 = ( (1/2)^3 )^2 = (1/8)^2 = 1/64. Wait, but 1/8 ≠ 1/64. Wait, this contradicts the earlier equation. But that must mean I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, no. Wait, when we set x = y = z = 1/√2, then in the initial equations, 1/(xy) = 1/( (1/√2)^2 ) = 1/(1/2) = 2. On the other side, x/z + 1 = (1/√2)/(1/√2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. So that works. So equations are satisfied, but when we went to the transformed equation (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = (a b c)^2, with a = xy = 1/2, then (1 - 1/2)^3 = 1/8 vs ( (1/2)^3 )^2 = 1/64. So 1/8 ≠ 1/64, which would imply a contradiction. But since x = y = z = 1/√2 is a valid solution, there must be an error in the transformation.Wait, let&#39;s check back. The original transformation:From the three equations:1 = (x² y)/z + xy1 = (y² z)/x + yz1 = (z² x)/y + zxThen, when I multiplied the three equations (x/z * y/x * z/y) = 1, and the product of the right-hand sides equals 1.But wait, actually, in that step, I think I made a mistake. Wait, no.Wait, the original step was taking each equation:From equation 1: x/z = (1/(xy) - 1)Equation 2: y/x = (1/(yz) - 1)Equation 3: z/y = (1/(zx) - 1)Then multiplying all three left sides: (x/z)*(y/x)*(z/y) = 1Multiplying all three right sides: [ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ]Therefore, 1 = product of the right sides. So expanding that:[ (1 - xy)/xy * (1 - yz)/yz * (1 - zx)/zx ] = 1Which simplifies to (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) / (x^2 y^2 z^2 ) = 1Therefore, (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) = x^2 y^2 z^2But if x = y = z = 1/√2, then xy = 1/2, so (1 - 1/2)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and x^2 y^2 z^2 = ( (1/2)^3 )^2 = (1/8)^2 = 1/64. So 1/8 ≠ 1/64. Therefore, contradiction. That suggests that either my substitution is wrong, or the assumption that x = y = z is a solution is wrong. But earlier, plugging into original equations worked. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution process.Wait, perhaps when I multiplied the three equations, I misrepresented them.Wait, let me re-examine:Original equations:1. x/z = (1/(xy) - 1)2. y/x = (1/(yz) - 1)3. z/y = (1/(zx) - 1)Multiplying all three left sides: (x/z)*(y/x)*(z/y) = 1Multiplying all three right sides: [ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ]So the product is equal to 1. Therefore,1 = [ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ]But when x = y = z = 1/√2, then 1/(xy) = 2, so each term (1/(xy) - 1 ) = 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, the product is 1*1*1 = 1, which equals 1. So that works.Wait, but when I converted to (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) / (x^2 y^2 z^2 ) = 1, maybe that&#39;s incorrect?Wait, let&#39;s check again:Starting with:[ (1/(xy) - 1 ) * (1/(yz) - 1 ) * (1/(zx) - 1 ) ] = 1Each term is (1/(xy) - 1 ) = (1 - xy)/xySimilarly for others. Therefore, product is:[(1 - xy)/xy] * [(1 - yz)/yz] * [(1 - zx)/zx] = [ (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) ] / (xy * yz * zx )But xy * yz * zx = (x y z)^2Therefore, [ (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) ] / (x y z)^2 = 1Therefore,(1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) = (x y z)^2But when x = y = z = 1/√2, then xy = 1/2, so (1 - 1/2)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and (x y z)^2 = ( (1/√2)^3 )^2 = (1/(2√2))^2 = 1/(8*2) = 1/16. Wait, wait, (1/√2)^3 = 1/(2√2), squared is 1/(8). Wait, no:Wait, x = y = z = 1/√2x y z = (1/√2)^3 = 1/(2√2)Then (x y z)^2 = (1/(2√2))^2 = 1/(8*2) = 1/16. Wait, 2√2 squared is 8, so 1/(2√2)^2 is 1/(8). Wait, actually:Wait, (2√2)^2 = 4*2 = 8. Therefore, (1/(2√2))^2 = 1/(8). Therefore, (x y z)^2 = 1/8. Therefore, the right side is 1/8, and the left side is (1 - 1/2)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8. So 1/8 = 1/8. Okay, so that works. So my earlier calculation was wrong because I miscalculated (x y z)^2. So when x = y = z = 1/√2, then (x y z)^2 = (1/(2√2))^2 = 1/(8). So 1/8 = 1/8. Therefore, that works. Therefore, the transformed equation is correct.Therefore, (1 - xy)(1 - yz)(1 - zx) = (xyz)^2So, with x = y = z, that works. But are there other solutions?Suppose there is another solution where variables are not equal. Let&#39;s assume that maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different.Let me suppose that x = y, but z is different. Then, let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible.Let x = y. Then, equations 1 and 2 become:Equation 1: 1/(x^2) = x/z + 1Equation 2: 1/(x z) = 1/x + 1Wait, equation 2: 1/(y z) = y/x + 1. If y = x, then equation 2 becomes 1/(x z) = 1 + 1 = 2, so 1/(x z) = 2 =&gt; x z = 1/2.Equation 1: 1/(x^2) = x/z + 1. But from equation 2, z = 1/(2x). Substitute into equation 1:1/(x^2) = x / (1/(2x)) + 1 = x * 2x + 1 = 2x^2 + 1So 1/(x^2) = 2x^2 + 1Multiply both sides by x^2:1 = 2x^4 + x^2Let me set u = x^2. Then:1 = 2u^2 + u =&gt; 2u^2 + u - 1 = 0Solving quadratic equation:u = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 + 8) ] / 4 = [ -1 ± 3 ] / 4Since u must be positive, u = ( -1 + 3 ) / 4 = 2/4 = 1/2Therefore, x^2 = 1/2 =&gt; x = 1/√2. Then z = 1/(2x) = 1/(2*(1/√2)) = √2 / 2 = 1/√2. Therefore, z = 1/√2 = x = y. Therefore, the only solution in this case is the symmetric solution. Hence, assuming two variables equal leads back to the symmetric solution.Similarly, suppose another pair is equal, say y = z. Then equation 2 and 3 would involve y and z. Let&#39;s check.Let y = z. Then equation 2: 1/(y^2) = y/x + 1Equation 3: 1/(x y) = 1/y + 1 =&gt; 1/(x y) = (1 + y)/y =&gt; 1/(x y) = 1/y + 1 =&gt; Multiply both sides by y: 1/x = 1 + y =&gt; x = 1/(1 + y)From equation 2: 1/y² = y/x + 1. Substitute x = 1/(1 + y):1/y² = y*(1 + y) + 1 =&gt; 1/y² = y + y² + 1Multiply both sides by y²:1 = y^3 + y^2 + ySo y^3 + y^2 + y - 1 = 0Looking for real positive roots. Let&#39;s try y = 0.5:0.125 + 0.25 + 0.5 - 1 = -0.125y = 0.6:0.216 + 0.36 + 0.6 - 1 = 1.176 - 1 = 0.176y = 0.5: -0.125; y = 0.6: 0.176. So there is a root between 0.5 and 0.6.Using rational root theorem: possible rational roots are ±1. Testing y=1: 1 + 1 + 1 -1 = 2 ≠ 0.So equation y^3 + y^2 + y -1 =0 has one real positive root. Let&#39;s approximate it.Let’s use Newton-Raphson method. Let f(y) = y^3 + y^2 + y -1f(0.5) = -0.125f(0.6) = 0.6^3 + 0.6^2 + 0.6 -1 = 0.216 + 0.36 + 0.6 -1 = 1.176 -1 = 0.176f&#39;(y) = 3y^2 + 2y +1Starting with y0 =0.6f(y0)=0.176f&#39;(y0)=3*(0.36) + 2*(0.6) +1=1.08+1.2+1=3.28Next iteration y1 = y0 - f(y0)/f&#39;(y0) ≈0.6 - 0.176/3.28 ≈0.6 -0.0536≈0.5464Compute f(0.5464):0.5464^3 +0.5464^2 +0.5464 -1≈0.5464*(0.5464^2 +0.5464 +1) -1First compute 0.5464^2 ≈0.29850.2985 +0.5464 +1≈1.84490.5464*1.8449≈1.0071.007 -1≈0.007So f(0.5464)≈0.007f&#39;(0.5464)=3*(0.2985)+2*(0.5464)+1≈0.8955 +1.0928 +1≈2.9883Next iteration y2=0.5464 -0.007/2.9883≈0.5464 -0.0023≈0.5441Compute f(0.5441):0.5441^3 +0.5441^2 +0.5441 -1≈0.5441*(0.5441^2 +0.5441 +1) -10.5441^2≈0.2960.296 +0.5441 +1≈1.84010.5441*1.8401≈1.0031.003 -1≈0.003Still positive.

Let&#39;s take average y≈0.5436Therefore, approximate solution y≈0.5436. Then x=1/(1 + y)≈1/(1.5436)≈0.6475Then z=y≈0.5436Check equation 1: 1/(x y) = x/z +1x≈0.6475, y≈0.5436, z≈0.5436Left side: 1/(0.6475*0.5436)≈1/(0.3518)≈2.843Right side: x/z +1≈0.6475/0.5436 +1≈1.191 +1≈2.191Not equal. So discrepancy here. So the approximate solution does not satisfy equation 1, which suggests that even if we assume y = z, the solution doesn&#39;t satisfy all equations unless x = y = z. Therefore, perhaps the only solution is the symmetric one.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a scaling factor. Let me consider that.Suppose we let x = k a, y = k b, z = k c, where k is a positive real number, and a, b, c are positive real numbers to be determined. Then, perhaps substituting into equations to find a relation.But this might complicate things. Alternatively, let&#39;s make a substitution to simplify variables.Let’s set a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. Then, abc = (x/y)(y/z)(z/x) =1.But perhaps with these ratios, we can express the equations in terms of a, b, c.From equation 1: 1/(xy) = x/z +1Expressed in terms of a, b, c:x = a y, z = y/b, so x/z = a y / (y/b ) = a bTherefore, equation 1 becomes:1/( (a y) y ) = a b +1 =&gt; 1/(a y²) = a b +1Similarly, equation 2: 1/(y z) = y/x +1. Since z = y/b, x = a y, so y/x = 1/a, and y z = y*(y/b) = y² / bThus equation 2 becomes: b / y² = 1/a +1Equation 3: 1/(z x) = z/y +1. z x = (y/b)(a y) = a y² / b. z/y = (y/b)/y = 1/bThus equation 3 becomes: b/(a y²) = 1/b +1So now we have three equations in terms of a, b, y:Equation1: 1/(a y²) = a b +1 --&gt; (1)Equation2: b / y² = 1/a +1 --&gt; (2)Equation3: b/(a y²) = 1/b +1 --&gt; (3)Let’s express y² from equation2. From equation2: y² = b / (1/a +1 ) = b / ( (1 + a)/a ) = (a b)/(1 + a)Then, substitute y² into equation1:1/(a * (a b)/(1 + a)) ) = a b +1 =&gt; (1 + a)/(a² b) = a b +1Multiply both sides by a² b:1 + a = a³ b² + a² bSimilarly, from equation3: b/(a y²) = 1/b +1. Substitute y² from equation2: y² = (a b)/(1 + a). Then:b/(a * (a b)/(1 + a)) ) = (1 + a)/(a²) = (1 + a)/a²So equation3 becomes:(1 + a)/a² = 1/b +1Therefore, 1/b = (1 + a)/a² -1 = (1 + a - a²)/a²Hence, b = a² / (1 + a - a² )Now, substitute this expression for b into the equation from above: 1 + a = a³ b² + a² bFirst, compute b = a² / (1 + a - a² )Compute b² = a^4 / (1 + a - a² )²Then,a³ b² = a³ * a^4 / (1 + a - a² )² = a^7 / (1 + a - a² )²a² b = a² * a² / (1 + a - a² ) = a^4 / (1 + a - a² )Therefore, equation becomes:1 + a = a^7 / (1 + a - a² )² + a^4 / (1 + a - a² )Multiply both sides by (1 + a - a² )²:(1 + a)(1 + a - a² )² = a^7 + a^4 (1 + a - a² )This seems highly complex. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach here.Alternatively, if we assume a =1, which would correspond to x = y. Let’s check a=1:If a=1, then from equation2: b =1² / (1 +1 -1² ) =1/(1 +1 -1 )=1/1=1Then b=1. Then from equation2, y² = (a b)/(1 +a ) = (1*1)/(2 )=1/2. So y=1/√2. Then x =a y =1*(1/√2 )=1/√2, z = y/b =1/√2 /1=1/√2. So x=y=z=1/√2. So that&#39;s the symmetric solution again.If a ≠1, then we have to solve the complex equation above, which might not have positive real solutions.Alternatively, perhaps the only solution is the symmetric one. Therefore, concluding that x=y=z=1/√2 is the only positive real solution.Alternatively, to confirm, let&#39;s check with another approach. Let’s assume that variables are equal, so x=y=z=k. Then, substitute into each equation:1/(k^2 )=k/k +1 =&gt;1/k² =1 +1=2 =&gt;k=1/√2. Hence, the solution is unique when variables are equal.To check if there are other solutions, suppose that x ≠ y ≠ z. Let’s consider taking the equations and trying to find relationships between variables.From equation1: 1/(xy) =x/z +1. Let’s solve for z:Multiply both sides by z:z/(xy) =x + zThen:z/(xy) - z =xz(1/(xy) -1 )=xTherefore,z= x / (1/(xy) -1 )= x / ( (1 -xy)/xy )=x * (xy)/(1 -xy )=x² y / (1 -xy )Similarly, from equation2: 1/(yz)=y/x +1. Solve for x:Multiply both sides by x:x/(yz)= y +xx/(yz) -x =yx(1/(yz) -1 )= yx= y / (1/(yz) -1 )= y / ( (1 - yz)/yz )= y * yz/(1 - yz )= y² z / (1 - yz )Similarly, from equation3: 1/(zx)=z/y +1. Solve for y:Multiply both sides by y:y/(zx)= z + yy/(zx) -y =zy(1/(zx) -1 )=zy= z / (1/(zx) -1 )= z / ( (1 - zx)/zx )= z * zx/(1 - zx )= z² x / (1 -zx )Therefore, we have:z= x² y / (1 -xy )x= y² z / (1 - yz )y= z² x / (1 -zx )This creates a cyclic dependency. Let&#39;s substitute z from the first equation into the second equation.From second equation: x = y² z / (1 - yz ). Substitute z from first equation:x = y²*(x² y / (1 -xy )) / (1 - y*(x² y / (1 -xy )) )Simplify denominator:1 - y*(x² y / (1 -xy )) =1 - x² y² / (1 -xy )= (1 -xy -x² y² ) / (1 -xy )Therefore,x = [ y²*(x² y / (1 -xy )) ] / [ (1 -xy -x² y² ) / (1 -xy ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator:x = [ y² x² y / (1 -xy ) ] * [ (1 -xy ) / (1 -xy -x² y² ) ]Cancel (1 -xy ) terms:x = ( y³ x² ) / (1 -xy -x² y² )Multiply both sides by denominator:x (1 -xy -x² y² ) = y³ x²Expand left side:x -x² y -x³ y² = y³ x²Bring all terms to left side:x -x² y -x³ y² -y³ x² =0Factor x:x [1 -x y -x² y² -x y³ ]=0Since x is positive, we can divide by x:1 -x y -x² y² -x y³ =0This equation seems complicated. Let’s factor terms:1 = x y + x² y² +x y³= x y (1 +x y + y² )Hmm. Let’s set t = x y. Then equation becomes:1 = t (1 + t + y² )But unless we can express y in terms of t, this may not help. Alternatively, note that in the symmetric solution, x y =1/2, and y =x, so y =1/√2, then t =1/2. Then:1 = (1/2)(1 +1/2 + (1/2)) = (1/2)(2) =1. So it works.But if variables aren&#39;t symmetric, this equation may not hold. Let me suppose that x y =1/2, but not necessarily x = y. Let’s see:If t =1/2, then 1 = (1/2)(1 +1/2 + y² ) =&gt; 2 = 1 +1/2 + y² =&gt; y² = 2 -1.5=0.5 =&gt; y=1/√2. Then x= t / y= (1/2)/(1/√2 )=√2 /2=1/√2. So again, symmetric solution.Alternatively, if t ≠1/2, then solving 1 = t (1 + t + y² ). But without additional relations, this seems difficult.Alternatively, maybe we can use the expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other.From earlier, we have:z= x² y / (1 -xy )x= y² z / (1 - yz )Substitute z from the first equation into the second:x= y²*(x² y / (1 -xy )) / (1 - y*(x² y / (1 -xy )) )This seems recursive and too complex. Alternatively, substitute variables in terms of ratios.Let’s define r = x/y and s = y/z. Then, x = r y, z = y/s.Substituting into the first equation:1/(x y )=x/z +1 =&gt;1/(r y * y )= (r y)/( y/s ) +1 =&gt;1/(r y² )= r s +1 =&gt;1= r y² (r s +1 )Similarly, second equation:1/(y z )= y/x +1 =&gt;1/( y*(y/s ) )= y/(r y ) +1 =&gt;s / y² =1/r +1 =&gt;s = y² (1/r +1 )Third equation:1/(z x )= z/y +1 =&gt;1/( (y/s)*(r y ) )= (y/s)/y +1 =&gt;1/( r y² /s )=1/s +1 =&gt;s/(r y² )=1/s +1 =&gt;s² / (r y² )=1 +sSo, we now have three equations:1. 1= r y² (r s +1 )2. s = y² (1/r +1 )3. s² / (r y² )=1 +sLet’s substitute equation 2 into equation 3. From equation2: y² = s / (1/r +1 )= s r / (1 +r )Plug into equation3:s² / ( r * (s r / (1 +r )) ) =1 +s =&gt; s² / ( (s r² ) / (1 +r ) )=1 +s =&gt; s² * (1 +r ) / (s r² )=1 +s =&gt; s(1 +r ) / r² =1 +sMultiply both sides by r²:s(1 +r ) = r² (1 +s )Expand:s + s r = r² + r² sBring all terms to left side:s + s r - r² -r² s=0Factor:s(1 + r - r² ) -r²=0Hmm. Let’s write this as:s(1 +r - r² ) =r²From equation2: s = y² (1/r +1 )= y² ( (1 +r ) / r )From equation1: 1= r y² (r s +1 )Let’s express y² from equation2: y²= s r / (1 +r )Substitute into equation1:1= r * (s r / (1 +r )) * (r s +1 )= r*(s r / (1 +r ))*(r s +1 )= (r² s / (1 +r ))*(r s +1 )So,1 = (r² s / (1 +r ))*(r s +1 )But from earlier, s(1 +r -r² )=r² =&gt; s= r² / (1 +r -r² )Substitute s into equation1 expression:1= (r² * [ r² / (1 +r -r² ) ] / (1 +r )) * ( r*[ r² / (1 +r -r² ) ] +1 )Simplify step by step.First, compute the first part:r² s / (1 +r ) = r² * (r² / (1 +r -r² )) / (1 +r )= r^4 / [ (1 +r -r² )(1 +r ) ]Then, compute the second part:r s +1 = r*( r² / (1 +r -r² ) ) +1= r^3 / (1 +r -r² ) +1= ( r^3 +1 +r -r² ) / (1 +r -r² )Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[ r^4 / ( (1 +r -r² )(1 +r ) ) ] * [ ( r^3 +1 +r -r² ) / (1 +r -r² ) ] =1Multiply numerators and denominators:[ r^4 ( r^3 +1 +r -r² ) ] / [ (1 +r -r² )^2 (1 +r ) ] =1Thus,r^4 ( r^3 +1 +r -r² ) = (1 +r -r² )^2 (1 +r )Expand the left side numerator:r^4 ( r^3 -r² +r +1 )=r^4 ( r^3 -r² +r +1 )Expand the right side denominator:(1 +r -r² )^2 (1 +r )First, compute (1 +r -r² )^2:= ( -r² + r +1 )^2 = r^4 -2 r^3 -r² +2 r +1Wait, no, let&#39;s expand it properly:(a + b +c)^2 = a² + b² +c² +2ab +2ac +2bc. Wait, but here it&#39;s ( -r² + r +1 )^2.Let me write it as ( -r² + r +1 )^2 = ( (-r²) + r +1 )^2.= ( -r² )^2 + (r )^2 + (1 )^2 + 2*(-r²)*r + 2*(-r²)*1 + 2*r*1= r^4 + r² +1 - 2 r^3 -2 r² + 2rSimplify:r^4 -2 r^3 -r² +2 r +1Then multiply by (1 +r ):(r^4 -2 r^3 -r² +2 r +1 )*(1 +r )Multiply term by term:= r^4*(1) + r^4*r -2 r^3*1 -2 r^3*r -r²*1 -r²*r +2 r*1 +2 r*r +1*1 +1*r= r^4 + r^5 -2 r^3 -2 r^4 -r² -r^3 +2 r +2 r² +1 +rCombine like terms:r^5 + (r^4 -2 r^4 ) + (-2 r^3 -r^3 ) + (-r² +2 r² ) + (2 r +r ) +1= r^5 - r^4 -3 r^3 + r² +3 r +1Therefore, the right side is r^5 - r^4 -3 r^3 + r² +3 r +1The left side is r^4 ( r^3 -r² +r +1 ) = r^7 -r^6 +r^5 +r^4Therefore, equation becomes:r^7 -r^6 +r^5 +r^4 = r^5 -r^4 -3 r^3 +r² +3 r +1Bring all terms to left side:r^7 -r^6 +r^5 +r^4 -r^5 +r^4 +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1=0Simplify:r^7 -r^6 + (r^5 -r^5 ) + (r^4 +r^4 ) +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1=0= r^7 -r^6 +2 r^4 +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1=0So, we have the equation:r^7 -r^6 +2 r^4 +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1=0This is a 7th-degree polynomial equation in r. Finding its roots analytically is practically impossible. But perhaps r=1 is a root.Test r=1:1 -1 +2 +3 -1 -3 -1=0. Let&#39;s compute:1 -1=0; 0 +2=2; 2 +3=5; 5 -1=4; 4 -3=1; 1 -1=0. Yes, r=1 is a root.Therefore, we can factor out (r -1 ):Using polynomial division or synthetic division.Let’s perform polynomial division of r^7 -r^6 +2 r^4 +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1 by (r -1 ).Using synthetic division for root r=1:Coefficients: 1 (r^7 ), -1 (r^6 ), 0 (r^5 ), 2 (r^4 ), 3 (r^3 ), -1 (r^2 ), -3 (r ), -1 (constant )Bring down the 1.Multiply by 1: 1.Add to next coefficient: -1 +1=0.Multiply by1:0.Add to next coefficient:0 +0=0.Multiply by1:0.Add to next coefficient:2 +0=2.Multiply by1:2.Add to next coefficient:3 +2=5.Multiply by1:5.Add to next coefficient:-1 +5=4.Multiply by1:4.Add to next coefficient:-3 +4=1.Multiply by1:1.Add to next coefficient:-1 +1=0.So, the quotient polynomial is:r^6 +0 r^5 +0 r^4 +2 r^3 +5 r² +4 r +1Thus,r^7 -r^6 +2 r^4 +3 r^3 -r² -3 r -1=(r -1 )(r^6 +2 r^3 +5 r² +4 r +1 )Now, check if r=1 is a root of the quotient polynomial:1^6 +2*1^3 +5*1^2 +4*1 +1=1 +2 +5 +4 +1=13 ≠0Therefore, the remaining polynomial is r^6 +2 r^3 +5 r² +4 r +1. Let&#39;s check for other rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1. Testing r=1:13≠0; r=-1:1 -2 +5 -4 +1=1-2= -1 +5=4 -4=0 +1=1≠0.Therefore, no rational roots. Since we&#39;re looking for positive real roots (r=x/y &gt;0 ), and we already have r=1 as a root, which gives the symmetric solution. The other factors are a 6th-degree polynomial which likely doesn&#39;t have positive real roots, given the coefficients are all positive except for the linear term, but let&#39;s see:r^6 +2 r^3 +5 r² +4 r +1=0. For positive r, all terms are positive, so sum cannot be zero. Therefore, the only positive real root is r=1.Thus, the only solution is r=1, leading back to the symmetric case x=y=z=1/√2.Therefore, the only positive real solution is x=y=z=1/√2.Final AnswerThe positive real solution is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}} for each of (x), (y), and (z).&lt;/think&gt;Given the system of equations for positive real numbers:frac{1}{x y}=frac{x}{z}+1, quad frac{1}{y z}=frac{y}{x}+1, quad frac{1}{z x}=frac{z}{y}+1We start by testing the assumption that (x = y = z). Substituting (x = y = z = k) into the first equation:frac{1}{k^2} = frac{k}{k} + 1 implies frac{1}{k^2} = 2 implies k^2 = frac{1}{2} implies k = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}We verify this solution by substituting (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) into all three equations:1. (frac{1}{left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^2} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} + 1 implies 2 = 2)2. (frac{1}{left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^2} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} + 1 implies 2 = 2)3. (frac{1}{left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^2} = frac{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}}{frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} + 1 implies 2 = 2)All equations are satisfied, confirming that (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) is a solution.To check if there are other solutions, we consider the product of the transformed equations and use substitutions. However, we find that the equations lead back to the symmetric solution when assuming any two variables are equal or through polynomial factorization, showing that the only positive real solution is when (x), (y), and (z) are equal.Thus, the positive real solution is:[boxed{dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}}]for each of (x), (y), and (z).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9152f154></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>🔑:</span>Solution: The given system reduces toz=x^{2} y+x y z, x=y^{z}+x y z, y=z^{2} x+x y zHencez-x^{2} y=x-y^{2} z=y-z^{2} xIf x=y, then y^{2} z=z^{2} x and hence x^{2} z=z^{2} x.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.First, I know that to find the points of intersection between the line and the function, I need to set them equal to each other. So, let me start by setting kx + 3 equal to sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8) + 2. That gives me the equation:kx + 3 = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8) + 2.Now, I can simplify this equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:kx + 1 = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8).Next, to eliminate the square root, I should square both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I need to make sure that both sides are defined. The expression inside the square root, -x² + 2x + 8, must be non-negative. Let me check the domain of the square root function first.So, solving -x² + 2x + 8 ≥ 0:This is a quadratic inequality. Let&#39;s rewrite it as x² - 2x - 8 ≤ 0. To find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 32)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(36)] / 2 = [2 ± 6]/2.Thus, x = (2 + 6)/2 = 4 and x = (2 - 6)/2 = -2. So the quadratic is positive between x = -2 and x = 4. Therefore, the domain of the original function y = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8) + 2 is x ∈ [-2, 4]. So, any solutions must lie within this interval.Now, going back to the equation:kx + 1 = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8).Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:(kx + 1)² = (-x² + 2x + 8).Expanding the left side:k²x² + 2kx + 1 = -x² + 2x + 8.Bring all terms to one side:k²x² + 2kx + 1 + x² - 2x - 8 = 0.Combine like terms:(k² + 1)x² + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0.So, the quadratic equation in x is:(k² + 1)x² + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0.Since the line intersects the graph at two points A and B, this quadratic equation must have two real solutions. The discriminant of this quadratic must be positive. Let&#39;s check the discriminant D:D = (2k - 2)² - 4*(k² + 1)*(-7).Calculating D:First, expand (2k - 2)²:= 4k² - 8k + 4.Then, compute 4*(k² + 1)*(-7):= -28*(k² + 1) = -28k² - 28.So, discriminant D = 4k² - 8k + 4 + 28k² + 28 = (4k² + 28k²) + (-8k) + (4 + 28) = 32k² -8k + 32.Factor out 8: D = 8(4k² - k + 4). Hmm, but 4k² -k +4 is a quadratic in k. Let me check if this quadratic ever becomes zero. The discriminant here would be (-1)² - 4*4*4 = 1 - 64 = -63, which is negative, so 4k² -k +4 is always positive. Therefore, D = 8*(positive) = positive for any real k. So, the quadratic equation will always have two real roots for any k, which makes sense because the line could intersect the semicircle (since the original function is a semicircle) at two points. Wait, is the original function a semicircle? Let me check.Original function: y = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8) + 2.Let me rewrite the expression under the square root:- x² + 2x + 8 = -(x² - 2x) + 8.Complete the square for x² - 2x:x² - 2x + 1 - 1 = (x - 1)^2 - 1.So, substituting back:-( (x - 1)^2 - 1 ) + 8 = - (x - 1)^2 + 1 + 8 = - (x - 1)^2 + 9.Therefore, the original function is:y = sqrt( - (x - 1)^2 + 9 ) + 2 = sqrt(9 - (x - 1)^2 ) + 2.Which is the upper half of the circle centered at (1, 2) with radius 3, since sqrt(9 - (x -1)^2) is the upper semicircle (because sqrt is non-negative) with center (1,0) and radius 3, but then we add 2 to the y-coordinate, so shifting up by 2. So the center is (1, 2) and radius 3. Therefore, the original function is indeed a semicircle centered at (1, 2) with radius 3. So the graph is a semicircle above the x-axis.Therefore, the line y = kx + 3 is a straight line with slope k and y-intercept 3. We need this line to intersect the semicircle at two points A and B such that the distance between them is 12√5 / 5.So, in circle geometry, the distance between two points on a circle can be related to the chord length. The formula for the chord length is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the line (the chord), and r is the radius. Wait, is that correct?Wait, chord length is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. So in this case, the chord AB has length 12√5 / 5, and the radius of the circle is 3. Therefore, we can use this formula to find the distance from the center to the line y = kx + 3.But wait, the center of the circle is (1, 2). So the distance from the center (1,2) to the line kx - y + 3 = 0 (since y = kx +3 can be written as kx - y + 3 = 0) is given by:d = |k*1 - 1*2 + 3| / sqrt(k² + (-1)^2) = |k - 2 + 3| / sqrt(k² + 1) = |k +1| / sqrt(k² +1).Then, the chord length AB should be 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(9 - ( (k +1)^2 / (k² +1) )).But the chord length is given as 12√5 /5. Therefore:2√(9 - ( (k +1)^2 / (k² +1) )) = 12√5 /5.Divide both sides by 2:√(9 - ( (k +1)^2 / (k² +1) )) = 6√5 /5.Square both sides:9 - ( (k +1)^2 / (k² +1) ) = (36*5)/25 = 180/25 = 36/5.So,9 - 36/5 = (k +1)^2 / (k² +1 )Compute 9 - 36/5: 9 is 45/5, so 45/5 -36/5 = 9/5.Thus,9/5 = (k +1)^2 / (k² +1 )Multiply both sides by (k² +1):9/5*(k² +1) = (k +1)^2.Expand the right side:9/5*(k² +1) = k² + 2k +1.Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:9(k² +1) = 5(k² + 2k +1).Expand both sides:9k² +9 =5k² +10k +5.Bring all terms to one side:9k² +9 -5k² -10k -5 =0Simplify:4k² -10k +4 =0.Divide equation by 2:2k² -5k +2 =0.Now, solve this quadratic equation for k.The discriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*2*2 =25 -16=9.Solutions:k = [5 ±3]/4.Therefore,k = (5 +3)/4 =8/4=2,ork=(5 -3)/4=2/4=1/2.Therefore, possible values of k are 2 and 1/2. But we need to check if these values are valid, considering that when we squared the original equation, we might have introduced extraneous solutions. Also, we need to ensure that the points of intersection lie on the semicircle, i.e., the original square root function.Alternatively, since we used the chord length formula, which is derived from the circle equation, and since the chord lies entirely on the semicircle (upper half), but actually, the chord AB is part of the semicircle, so as long as the line intersects the semicircle at two points, which is already considered in the chord length formula. However, we need to confirm that the line y=kx +3 actually intersects the semicircle at two points. Since we found two possible k values, let&#39;s check them.But wait, when we derived the chord length formula, we assumed the line intersects the circle (the entire circle), but in our case, the function is only the upper semicircle. Therefore, we need to ensure that the intersection points A and B lie on the upper semicircle, i.e., their y-coordinates must be greater than or equal to 2 (since the original function is y = sqrt(...) +2, which is ≥ 2). However, the line y = kx +3 has a y-intercept at 3, so depending on the slope k, it might intersect the upper semicircle at two points. But let&#39;s check for k=2 and k=1/2.First, check k=2: the line is y=2x +3. Let&#39;s see if this line intersects the semicircle.Alternatively, since we derived k=2 and k=1/2 through the chord length formula, which already accounts for the distance from the center to the line, and since the chord is part of the circle, but the original problem states that the intersections are at points A and B on the graph of the function, which is the upper semicircle. Therefore, we need to ensure that the line y=kx +3 intersects the upper semicircle, not the lower one. However, since the line y=kx +3 has a y-intercept at 3, which is above the center of the circle (1,2), depending on the slope, the line could intersect the upper semicircle in two points. Let&#39;s check both k=2 and k=1/2.First, k=2: The line is steeper. Let&#39;s find the points of intersection by solving the equation 2x +3 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8) +2. Wait, let&#39;s check if this was already considered when we set up the quadratic. Wait, but we squared the equation and found quadratic in x, which we solved, but perhaps we can check if these k values give real intersections on the upper semicircle.Alternatively, perhaps both solutions are valid. Let me verify with k=2.For k=2, let&#39;s compute the quadratic equation we had earlier:(k² +1)x² + (2k -2)x -7 =0.Plugging in k=2:(4 +1)x² + (4 -2)x -7 = 5x² +2x -7=0.Solutions:x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +140)] /10 = [-2 ± sqrt(144)] /10 = [-2 ±12]/10.Therefore, x=( -2 +12 )/10=10/10=1, and x=( -2 -12 )/10= -14/10=-1.4.Now, check if these x-values are in the domain [-2,4]. For x=1 and x=-1.4: both are within [-2,4]. Now, check the corresponding y-values on the line y=2x +3:At x=1: y=2(1)+3=5.At x=-1.4: y=2(-1.4)+3= -2.8 +3=0.2.Wait, but the original function y = sqrt(...) +2 gives y ≥2. So the point (-1.4,0.2) is not on the upper semicircle. Therefore, this is a problem. So, when k=2, the line intersects the upper semicircle at x=1, y=5, but the other intersection is at x=-1.4, y=0.2, which is below y=2. Therefore, this point is not on the graph of the original function. Hence, k=2 is not a valid solution because one of the intersection points is not on the upper semicircle. Therefore, k=2 is extraneous.Now check k=1/2.k=1/2, then the line is y=(1/2)x +3.Again, plug into the quadratic equation:(k² +1)x² + (2k -2)x -7=0.k=1/2:( (1/4) +1 )x² + (1 -2)x -7= (5/4)x² -x -7=0.Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:5x² -4x -28=0.Solutions:x = [4 ± sqrt(16 +560)] /10 = [4 ± sqrt(576)] /10 = [4 ±24]/10.Thus,x=(4 +24)/10=28/10=2.8,x=(4 -24)/10= -20/10=-2.Check if these x-values are within the domain [-2,4]. Both x=2.8 and x=-2 are within the interval.Now, check the corresponding y-values on the line y=(1/2)x +3.For x=2.8: y=1.4 +3=4.4.For x=-2: y=(1/2)(-2)+3= -1 +3=2.So, both points (2.8,4.4) and (-2,2) are on the line. Now, check if they are on the original function y= sqrt(-x² +2x +8)+2.At x=2.8:First compute -x² +2x +8:- (2.8)^2 +2*(2.8) +8= -7.84 +5.6 +8= ( -7.84 +5.6 ) +8= -2.24 +8=5.76.sqrt(5.76)=2.4, so y=2.4 +2=4.4. Correct.At x=-2:- (-2)^2 +2*(-2) +8= -4 -4 +8=0.sqrt(0)=0, so y=0 +2=2. Correct.Therefore, both intersection points are valid for k=1/2. Therefore, k=1/2 is the correct solution.Hence, the value of k is 1/2.Final AnswerThe value of ( k ) is (boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}).&lt;/think&gt;To find the value of ( k ) such that the line ( y = kx + 3 ) intersects the graph of ( y = sqrt{-x^2 + 2x + 8} + 2 ) at points ( A ) and ( B ) with ( |AB| = frac{12sqrt{5}}{5} ), we start by setting the equations equal to each other:[kx + 3 = sqrt{-x^2 + 2x + 8} + 2]Simplifying, we get:[kx + 1 = sqrt{-x^2 + 2x + 8}]Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:[(kx + 1)^2 = -x^2 + 2x + 8]Expanding and simplifying:[k^2x^2 + 2kx + 1 = -x^2 + 2x + 8][(k^2 + 1)x^2 + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0]The quadratic equation must have two real solutions. The discriminant ( D ) of this quadratic is calculated as:[D = (2k - 2)^2 - 4(k^2 + 1)(-7) = 32k^2 - 8k + 32]Since the discriminant is always positive, the quadratic has two real roots. The chord length formula for the circle (semicircle) is used to relate the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ). The center of the semicircle is ( (1, 2) ) with radius 3. The distance from the center to the line ( kx - y + 3 = 0 ) is:[d = frac{|k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}}]Using the chord length formula ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} ):[2sqrt{9 - left(frac{(k + 1)^2}{k^2 + 1}right)} = frac{12sqrt{5}}{5}]Solving this equation, we find:[sqrt{9 - frac{(k + 1)^2}{k^2 + 1}} = frac{6sqrt{5}}{5}]Squaring both sides:[9 - frac{(k + 1)^2}{k^2 + 1} = frac{36}{5}]Simplifying:[frac{9}{5} = frac{(k + 1)^2}{k^2 + 1}]Cross-multiplying and solving the quadratic equation:[9(k^2 + 1) = 5(k + 1)^2][4k^2 - 10k + 4 = 0]Solving for ( k ):[k = frac{5 pm 3}{4}]This gives ( k = 2 ) or ( k = frac{1}{2} ). Checking validity, ( k = 2 ) results in an intersection below the semicircle, leaving ( k = frac{1}{2} ) as the valid solution.[boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the value of k such that the line y = kx + 3 intersects the graph of y = sqrt(-x² + 2x + 8) + 2 at points A and B, and the distance between A and B is 12√5 / 5. Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I should visualize both graphs. The line is a straight line with slope k and y-intercept 3. The other function is a square root function, which usually gives a semicircle or part of a circle. Let me check the expression under the square root: -x² + 2x + 8. That can be rewritten as - (x² - 2x) + 8. Completing the square for the quadratic inside the sqrt:x² - 2x = (x - 1)² - 1. So substituting back, we get -[(x - 1)² - 1] + 8 = - (x - 1)² + 1 + 8 = - (x - 1)² + 9. Therefore, the expression under the sqrt is - (x - 1)² + 9, which is 9 - (x - 1)². So the original function is y = sqrt(9 - (x - 1)²) + 2. This looks like the upper half of a circle with center at (1, 2) and radius 3, since sqrt(9 - (x - 1)²) is the upper semicircle centered at (1, 0) with radius 3, but then we add 2 to the entire function, shifting it up by 2 units. So actually, the center is (1, 2) and radius 3. So the graph is a semicircle starting from the center (1, 2) and radius 3, but only the upper half because square root gives non-negative values. Wait, actually, the equation y = sqrt(9 - (x - 1)²) + 2 is equivalent to (y - 2)² + (x - 1)² = 9 with y ≥ 2. So yes, it&#39;s a circle with center (1, 2), radius 3, but only the part where y is at least 2. So the semicircle is actually the upper half of the circle. So the line y = kx + 3 intersects this upper semicircle at two points A and B, and the distance between them is 12√5 / 5. I need to find k. To find the points of intersection between the line and the semicircle, I can set them equal:kx + 3 = sqrt(9 - (x - 1)^2) + 2Subtract 2 from both sides:kx + 1 = sqrt(9 - (x - 1)^2)Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:(kx + 1)^2 = 9 - (x - 1)^2Expand both sides:Left side: (kx)^2 + 2kx + 1Right side: 9 - (x² - 2x + 1) = 9 - x² + 2x - 1 = 8 - x² + 2xSo, left side: k²x² + 2kx + 1 = right side: -x² + 2x + 8Bring all terms to one side:k²x² + 2kx + 1 + x² - 2x - 8 = 0Combine like terms:(k² + 1)x² + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0So, quadratic in x: (k² + 1)x² + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0Let me denote this quadratic equation as Ax² + Bx + C = 0 where:A = k² + 1B = 2k - 2C = -7The solutions to this quadratic will give the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let the roots be x1 and x2.The distance between points A and B can be found using the distance formula. Since both points lie on the line y = kx + 3, the coordinates of A and B are (x1, kx1 + 3) and (x2, kx2 + 3). The distance squared between them is:[(x2 - x1)^2 + (k x2 + 3 - k x1 - 3)^2] = [(x2 - x1)^2 + (k(x2 - x1))^2] = (x2 - x1)^2 (1 + k²)So, |AB| = sqrt[(1 + k²)(x2 - x1)^2] = |x2 - x1| sqrt(1 + k²)Given that |AB| = 12√5 /5, so:|x2 - x1| sqrt(1 + k²) = 12√5 /5But |x2 - x1| is the absolute difference of the roots of the quadratic. For a quadratic Ax² + Bx + C =0, the difference of roots is sqrt[(B² - 4AC)/A²]. Wait, actually, the difference is sqrt[(x1 + x2)^2 - 4x1x2] = sqrt[(B² - 4AC)/A²] multiplied by |A|? Wait, let me recall.For quadratic equation ax² + bx + c =0, the roots are x1 and x2.Then, the difference x1 - x2 is sqrt[(x1 + x2)^2 - 4x1x2] = sqrt[( -b/a )^2 - 4(c/a )] = sqrt[(b² - 4ac)/a²] = sqrt(b² -4ac)/|a|.But since we take the absolute difference |x1 - x2|, it&#39;s sqrt(b² -4ac)/|a|.So in this case, |x2 - x1| = sqrt(B² - 4AC)/|A|Given A = k² +1, which is always positive, so |A| = A.Therefore, |x2 -x1| = sqrt[(2k -2)^2 - 4*(k² +1)*(-7)] / (k² +1)Compute numerator:First, expand (2k -2)^2: 4k² -8k +4Then compute 4AC: 4*(k² +1)*(-7) = -28(k² +1)Therefore, B² -4AC = (4k² -8k +4) -4*(-7)(k² +1) = 4k² -8k +4 +28(k² +1) = 4k² -8k +4 +28k² +28 = (4k² +28k²) + (-8k) + (4 +28) = 32k² -8k +32So numerator is sqrt(32k² -8k +32). Let me factor out 8: sqrt[8(4k² -k +4)]. Hmm, not sure if helpful.Therefore, |x2 -x1| = sqrt(32k² -8k +32) / (k² +1)Therefore, the distance |AB| is sqrt(1 + k²) * sqrt(32k² -8k +32)/(k² +1) = sqrt(32k² -8k +32)/sqrt(k² +1)But according to the problem, this is equal to 12√5 /5So,sqrt(32k² -8k +32)/sqrt(k² +1) = 12√5 /5Square both sides:(32k² -8k +32)/(k² +1) = (144*5)/25 = (720)/25 = 144/5Therefore,(32k² -8k +32) = (144/5)(k² +1)Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominator:5*(32k² -8k +32) = 144*(k² +1)Compute left side:160k² -40k +160Right side:144k² +144Bring all terms to left side:160k² -40k +160 -144k² -144 =0Simplify:(160k² -144k²) + (-40k) + (160 -144) = 16k² -40k +16 =0Divide all terms by 8:2k² -5k +2 =0Now solve quadratic equation 2k² -5k +2=0Using quadratic formula:k = [5 ± sqrt(25 -16)] /4 = [5 ±3]/4So solutions:k=(5+3)/4=8/4=2, or k=(5-3)/4=2/4=1/2So k=2 or k=1/2Now, need to check if these values of k actually result in two intersection points, because squaring might introduce extraneous solutions.First, let&#39;s check k=2.The line is y=2x +3. We need to check if this line intersects the semicircle y=sqrt(-x² +2x +8)+2 at two points.Alternatively, since the original equation after squaring might have introduced solutions where kx +3 is negative, but since the square root is always non-negative, the right-hand side is sqrt(...) +2, which is at least 2. So the left-hand side must be at least 2. So kx +3 &gt;= 2 =&gt; kx &gt;= -1. So depending on x, but if the solutions x1 and x2 satisfy kx +3 &gt;=2, then they are valid.But let&#39;s check.Suppose k=2.Original equation: 2x +3 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8) +2Subtract 2: 2x +1 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8)Left-hand side is 2x +1. The right-hand side is sqrt(-x² +2x +8). The expression under the sqrt must be non-negative, so -x² +2x +8 &gt;=0 =&gt; x² -2x -8 &lt;=0. Solving x² -2x -8=0: x=(2 ±sqrt(4 +32))/2=(2 ±sqrt(36))/2=(2 ±6)/2= 4 or -2. So the domain is x in [-2,4].So for k=2, the line y=2x+3 intersects the semicircle over x in [-2,4].Now, when we solved the quadratic equation for x, we had solutions. Let&#39;s check if the original equation holds for those x&#39;s.But perhaps instead, since we squared the equation, we might have introduced extraneous roots. So let&#39;s check.Alternatively, since the quadratic equation had solutions, perhaps both roots are valid. But let&#39;s check.But perhaps a better approach is to verify if the line with k=2 intersects the semicircle at two points.Alternatively, since the quadratic equation we solved had two roots, but we need to check if when we plug x into the original equation, the left-hand side 2x +1 is equal to the square root (which is non-negative). So 2x +1 must be non-negative. So 2x +1 &gt;=0 =&gt; x &gt;= -0.5.But the domain of x is [-2,4]. So if the roots are x1 and x2, and both are &gt;= -0.5, then they are valid. If one is less than -0.5, then it would be extraneous.So let&#39;s compute the roots for k=2:Quadratic equation: (2² +1)x² + (2*2 -2)x -7 =0 =&gt; 5x² +2x -7=0Solutions: x = [-2 ±sqrt(4 +140)]/(10) = [-2 ±sqrt(144)]/10 = [-2 ±12]/10So x=(10)/10=1, or x=(-14)/10=-1.4So x=1 and x=-1.4. But x=-1.4 is -7/5, which is -1.4, which is within the domain [-2,4], but need to check if 2x +1 &gt;=0 for x=-1.4:2*(-1.4) +1 = -2.8 +1 = -1.8 &lt;0. So this would be invalid. Therefore, only x=1 is valid.But the problem states that the line intersects the semicircle at two points A and B. Therefore, if k=2 only gives one valid intersection point, then k=2 is invalid. Therefore, must discard k=2.Similarly, check k=1/2.So line y=(1/2)x +3.Set equal to sqrt(-x² +2x +8)+2:(1/2)x +3 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8) +2Subtract 2: (1/2)x +1 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8)Left-hand side: (1/2)x +1. For this to be valid, must have (1/2)x +1 &gt;=0 =&gt; x &gt;= -2. The domain is x in [-2,4], so x &gt;=-2 is satisfied. So the left-hand side is non-negative in the domain.Now, square both sides:[(1/2)x +1]^2 = -x² +2x +8Expand left side: (x²/4 + x +1) = -x² +2x +8Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fraction:x² +4x +4 = -4x² +8x +32Bring all terms to left:x² +4x +4 +4x² -8x -32 =0Combine like terms:5x² -4x -28 =0Solutions:x = [4 ±sqrt(16 +560)]/(10) = [4 ±sqrt(576)]/10 = [4 ±24]/10Thus, x=(28)/10=2.8 or x=(-20)/10=-2Check x=2.8 and x=-2 in original equation.First, x=2.8:Left-hand side: (1/2)(2.8) +1=1.4 +1=2.4Right-hand side: sqrt(-(2.8)^2 +2*(2.8) +8)+2.Compute inside sqrt:- (7.84) +5.6 +8 = -7.84 +13.6=5.76sqrt(5.76)=2.4, so 2.4 +2=4.4. Wait, wait, original equation was (1/2)x +3 = sqrt(...) +2. Wait, when we subtract 2, we had (1/2)x +1 = sqrt(...). Wait, but when x=2.8:Left-hand side: (1/2)x +1=1.4 +1=2.4Right-hand side: sqrt( - (2.8)^2 +2*2.8 +8 )=sqrt(-7.84 +5.6 +8)=sqrt(5.76)=2.4. So equality holds. Therefore, x=2.8 is valid.Now x=-2:Left-hand side: (1/2)*(-2) +1= -1 +1=0Right-hand side: sqrt(-(-2)^2 +2*(-2) +8)+2= sqrt(-4 -4 +8)+2=sqrt(0)+2=0+2=2Original equation after subtract 2: (1/2)x +1 = sqrt(...). So at x=-2, left-hand side is 0, right-hand side is 0. Wait, sqrt(...) at x=-2 is sqrt(0)=0. Wait, original equation after subtract 2: (1/2)x +1 = sqrt(-x² +2x +8). So for x=-2, left-hand side is 0, and sqrt(-x² +2x +8)=sqrt(-4 -4 +8)=sqrt(0)=0. So 0 = 0. Therefore, x=-2 is also a valid solution.But wait, the original problem states that the line intersects the graph at points A and B. The graph is y= sqrt(-x² +2x +8)+2, which is a semicircle as established before. At x=-2, y= sqrt(0)+2=0+2=2, so the point is (-2,2). The line y=(1/2)x +3 at x=-2 is y=(1/2)*(-2)+3= -1 +3=2. So the point (-2,2) is on both the line and the semicircle. Similarly, at x=2.8 (which is 14/5), y=(1/2)(14/5)+3=7/5 +15/5=22/5=4.4, and the semicircle y=sqrt(-x² +2x +8)+2 at x=14/5:Compute -x² +2x +8:x=14/5: x²=196/25So -196/25 +2*(14/5)+8= -196/25 +28/5 +8= -196/25 +140/25 +200/25= ( -196 +140 +200 )/25=144/25sqrt(144/25)=12/5, so y=12/5 +2=12/5 +10/5=22/5=4.4. So yes, the point (14/5,22/5) is valid. Therefore, both x=-2 and x=14/5 are valid intersections. But the original semicircle is defined for y &gt;=2, which is satisfied by both points. So with k=1/2, the line intersects the semicircle at (-2,2) and (14/5,22/5). Therefore, two points. So this is valid. However, with k=2, we had one valid point (x=1) and one invalid (x=-1.4), so only one intersection. Therefore, k=2 is invalid. Therefore, the only possible value is k=1/2.Wait, but let&#39;s verify the distance between points A(-2,2) and B(14/5,22/5). Compute |AB|:Difference in x: 14/5 - (-2)=14/5 +10/5=24/5Difference in y: 22/5 -2=22/5 -10/5=12/5Distance squared: (24/5)^2 + (12/5)^2= (576 +144)/25=720/25= (144*5)/25=144/5Therefore, distance is sqrt(144/5)=12/sqrt(5)=12√5/5, which matches the given distance. So yes, k=1/2 is valid. But earlier, we had two solutions for k: 2 and 1/2, but k=2 resulted in only one valid intersection point, so we discard it. Therefore, the answer is k=1/2.Final Answerboxed{dfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the line ( y = kx + 3 ) intersects the graph of the function ( y = sqrt{-x^2 + 2x + 8} + 2 ) at points ( A ) and ( B ), with ( |AB| = frac{12sqrt{5}}{5} ), we need to find the value of ( k ).First, we rewrite the function ( y = sqrt{-x^2 + 2x + 8} + 2 ) as the upper half of a circle with center ((1, 2)) and radius 3. The line ( y = kx + 3 ) intersects this circle. Setting the equations equal to each other:[kx + 3 = sqrt{9 - (x - 1)^2} + 2]Subtracting 2 from both sides and squaring both sides, we get:[(kx + 1)^2 = 9 - (x - 1)^2]Expanding and simplifying, we obtain the quadratic equation:[(k^2 + 1)x^2 + (2k - 2)x - 7 = 0]The distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) is given by:[|AB| = sqrt{(1 + k^2) left( (x_2 - x_1)^2 right)}]where ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are the roots of the quadratic equation. The distance formula simplifies to:[|x_2 - x_1| sqrt{1 + k^2} = frac{12sqrt{5}}{5}]Using the quadratic roots formula, we find the difference ( |x_2 - x_1| ):[|x_2 - x_1| = frac{sqrt{(2k - 2)^2 + 28(k^2 + 1)}}{k^2 + 1}]Substituting this into the distance formula and squaring both sides, we solve:[frac{32k^2 - 8k + 32}{k^2 + 1} = frac{144}{5}]Simplifying, we find the quadratic equation:[16k^2 - 40k + 16 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation, we get ( k = 2 ) or ( k = frac{1}{2} ). Checking for valid intersections, ( k = 2 ) results in only one valid intersection point, while ( k = frac{1}{2} ) results in two valid points. The distance calculation confirms ( k = frac{1}{2} ) is correct.[boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9152f154></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>🔑:</span>We first rewrite the function equation as ((x-1)^2+(y-2)^2=9, ygeq2).

Let me first recall what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is usually given by:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)dwhere a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.Given the problem, the arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a_1 = 2 and a_3 = 6. So, let me first find the common difference d.Since a_3 = 6, and using the formula:a_3 = a_1 + (3 - 1)d = 2 + 2dBut they told us that a_3 is 6, so:2 + 2d = 6Subtract 2 from both sides:2d = 4Divide by 2:d = 2Okay, so the common difference is 2. That makes the arithmetic sequence:a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 6, a_4 = 8, a_5 = 10, and so on.Now the problem says that if we add the same number to a_1, a_4, and a_5, the resulting three numbers form a geometric sequence. Let me denote the number to be added as x. So, after adding x, the three terms become:a_1 + x = 2 + xa_4 + x = 8 + xa_5 + x = 10 + xThese three numbers form a geometric sequence. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, r. So, for three terms to be in geometric sequence, the square of the middle term should be equal to the product of the first and the third terms. That is:(second term)^2 = (first term) * (third term)So, applying this here:(8 + x)^2 = (2 + x)(10 + x)Okay, so now I need to solve this equation for x.Let me expand both sides.Left side: (8 + x)^2 = 64 + 16x + x^2Right side: (2 + x)(10 + x) = 20 + 2x + 10x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2So, setting them equal:64 + 16x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2Hmm, let&#39;s subtract x^2 from both sides:64 + 16x = 20 + 12xNow, subtract 12x from both sides:64 + 4x = 20Subtract 64 from both sides:4x = 20 - 644x = -44Divide both sides by 4:x = -11Wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again.Starting from the equation:(8 + x)^2 = (2 + x)(10 + x)Expand left side:64 + 16x + x^2Right side:(2 + x)(10 + x) = 2*10 + 2x + 10x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2So, yes, that&#39;s correct. Then subtract x^2 from both sides:64 + 16x = 20 + 12xThen subtract 12x:64 + 4x = 20Subtract 64:4x = -44x = -11Okay, seems correct. Let me verify this answer. Let&#39;s substitute x = -11 into the three terms:a1 + x = 2 + (-11) = -9a4 + x = 8 + (-11) = -3a5 + x = 10 + (-11) = -1So, the three terms would be -9, -3, -1. Are these in a geometric sequence?Check the ratios:-3 / -9 = 1/3-1 / -3 = 1/3Yes, the common ratio is 1/3. So they form a geometric sequence. Therefore, x = -11 is the correct answer.But wait, the problem says &quot;the resulting three numbers form a geometric sequence.&quot; So, in order, they are a1 + x, a4 + x, a5 + x. So, that would be -9, -3, -1. Which is a geometric sequence with ratio 1/3.Alternatively, if the problem meant the terms after adding x to each of a1, a4, and a5, then arranged in the same order, so the three terms are a1 + x, a4 + x, a5 + x, which would be -9, -3, -1. So, yes, that&#39;s a geometric sequence. So, this seems correct.But let me just make sure there isn&#39;t another possible solution. Sometimes quadratic equations can have two solutions. Wait, in this case, after expanding, the x^2 terms canceled out, leading to a linear equation. So, there&#39;s only one solution. So, x = -11 is the only solution. Therefore, that must be the answer.Wait, but let me check if perhaps the problem is interpreted differently. Maybe the three numbers after adding x are supposed to form a geometric sequence in the order a1 + x, a4 + x, a5 + x. But maybe the indices are in a different order? But the problem says &quot;if we add the same number to a1, a4, and a5, the resulting three numbers form a geometric sequence&quot;. So, the order is preserved: the first, fourth, fifth terms, each added by x, so the three terms are (a1 + x), (a4 + x), (a5 + x). So, that would be -9, -3, -1, which is a geometric sequence. So, all steps are correct. Therefore, the answer is -11.But just to be thorough, let me check if there&#39;s another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, suppose I didn&#39;t compute d first. Let me try that approach.Given that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a1 = 2 and a3 = 6. Then, the common difference d can be found as:a3 = a1 + 2d =&gt; 6 = 2 + 2d =&gt; d = 2, same as before.Therefore, a1 = 2, a4 = a1 + 3d = 2 + 6 = 8, a5 = a1 + 4d = 2 + 8 = 10. So, same terms.So, adding x to each: 2 + x, 8 + x, 10 + x. These form a geometric sequence. Therefore, as before, (8 + x)^2 = (2 + x)(10 + x). Solving gives x = -11. So same result. So, seems solid.Alternatively, if someone miscalculates the expansion. Let me recheck:Left side: (8 + x)^2 = 8^2 + 2*8*x + x^2 = 64 + 16x + x^2Right side: (2 + x)(10 + x) = 2*10 + 2x + 10x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2Yes, correct. Then subtract the right side from the left:64 + 16x + x^2 - 20 - 12x - x^2 = 44 + 4x = 0 =&gt; 4x = -44 =&gt; x = -11Yep, all steps are correct. So, the answer is -11. Therefore, I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final AnswerThe number that is added is boxed{-11}.&lt;/think&gt;Given an arithmetic sequence ({a_n}) where (a_1 = 2) and (a_3 = 6), we first determine the common difference (d). Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we have:[a_3 = a_1 + 2d implies 6 = 2 + 2d implies 2d = 4 implies d = 2]Thus, the terms (a_1), (a_4), and (a_5) are:[a_1 = 2, quad a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 2 + 3 cdot 2 = 8, quad a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 2 + 4 cdot 2 = 10]We need to find a number (x) such that adding (x) to each of these terms results in a geometric sequence. The terms after adding (x) are (2 + x), (8 + x), and (10 + x). For these to form a geometric sequence, the square of the middle term must equal the product of the first and third terms:[(8 + x)^2 = (2 + x)(10 + x)]Expanding both sides:[64 + 16x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2]Subtracting (x^2) from both sides:[64 + 16x = 20 + 12x]Subtracting (12x) from both sides:[64 + 4x = 20]Subtracting 64 from both sides:[4x = -44 implies x = -11]Verifying the result, the terms after adding (x = -11) are (-9), (-3), and (-1), which form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of (frac{1}{3}). Therefore, the number that is added is (boxed{-11}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have an arithmetic sequence {a_n} where the first term a₁ = 2 and the third term a₃ = 6. We need to find a number x such that when we add x to a₁, a₄, and a₅, the resulting three numbers form a geometric sequence. Alright, let me break this down.First, since it&#39;s an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let&#39;s recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a₁ + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference. We know a₁ is 2, and a₃ is 6. Let&#39;s use this information to find the common difference d.So, a₃ = a₁ + 2d. Plugging in the known values: 6 = 2 + 2d. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives 4 = 2d, so dividing both sides by 2, we get d = 2. Great, so the common difference is 2. That means the sequence goes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc. So let&#39;s confirm that:a₁ = 2a₂ = 2 + 2 = 4a₃ = 4 + 2 = 6 (which matches the given information)a₄ = 6 + 2 = 8a₅ = 8 + 2 = 10Alright, so now we need to add the same number x to a₁, a₄, and a₅. That would give us three new numbers: (2 + x), (8 + x), and (10 + x). These three numbers are supposed to form a geometric sequence. Let&#39;s recall that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio r. So, if we have three terms b, c, d in a geometric sequence, then c/b = d/c, which implies c² = b*d.Applying this to our problem, the three terms after adding x are:First term: 2 + xSecond term: 8 + xThird term: 10 + xSo, according to the geometric sequence property, the square of the second term should equal the product of the first and third terms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:(8 + x)² = (2 + x)(10 + x)Now, let&#39;s expand both sides of this equation and solve for x.First, expanding the left side: (8 + x)² = 8² + 2*8*x + x² = 64 + 16x + x²Expanding the right side: (2 + x)(10 + x) = 2*10 + 2*x + x*10 + x*x = 20 + 2x + 10x + x² = 20 + 12x + x²So, putting it all together:64 + 16x + x² = 20 + 12x + x²Hmm, let&#39;s subtract the right side from the left side to simplify:64 + 16x + x² - 20 - 12x - x² = 0Simplifying term by term:64 - 20 = 4416x - 12x = 4xx² - x² = 0So, we end up with 44 + 4x = 0Solving for x:4x = -44x = -44 / 4x = -11Wait, so x is -11? Let me check if this works. Let&#39;s substitute x = -11 into the terms:First term: 2 + (-11) = -9Second term: 8 + (-11) = -3Third term: 10 + (-11) = -1So, the three terms would be -9, -3, -1. Let&#39;s check if this is a geometric sequence. The ratio between the second and first term is (-3)/(-9) = 1/3. The ratio between the third and second term is (-1)/(-3) = 1/3. So yes, the common ratio is 1/3, which is consistent. Therefore, x = -11 is indeed a solution.Wait, but let me make sure there are no other solutions. In the equation (8 + x)² = (2 + x)(10 + x), when we simplified, the x² terms canceled out, leading us to a linear equation which only has one solution. So, x = -11 is the only solution. Therefore, the number that is added is -11.But let me just confirm once again step by step to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake:1. Found d correctly: a₃ = a₁ + 2d =&gt; 6 = 2 + 2d =&gt; d = 2. Correct.2. Calculated a₄ = 8 and a₅ = 10. Correct.3. Set up the equation for the geometric sequence: (8 + x)² = (2 + x)(10 + x). Correct.4. Expanded both sides:Left: 64 + 16x + x²Right: 20 + 12x + x²Subtracting right from left: 44 + 4x = 0 =&gt; x = -11. Correct.5. Checked the terms with x = -11: -9, -3, -1, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 1/3. Correct.Therefore, the answer should be -11. But let me check once more if the problem says &quot;the number that is added&quot;. So, adding x, which is -11, so the number added is -11. That&#39;s the answer.Final AnswerThe number that is added is boxed{-11}.&lt;/think&gt;Given an arithmetic sequence ({a_n}) where (a_1 = 2) and (a_3 = 6), we need to find the number (x) that, when added to (a_1), (a_4), and (a_5), forms a geometric sequence.First, we determine the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence. Using the given terms:[a_3 = a_1 + 2d implies 6 = 2 + 2d implies 4 = 2d implies d = 2]Thus, the terms (a_1), (a_4), and (a_5) are:[a_1 = 2, quad a_4 = 2 + 3 cdot 2 = 8, quad a_5 = 2 + 4 cdot 2 = 10]Adding (x) to each of these terms, we get the sequence (2 + x), (8 + x), and (10 + x). For these to form a geometric sequence, the square of the middle term must equal the product of the first and third terms:[(8 + x)^2 = (2 + x)(10 + x)]Expanding both sides:[64 + 16x + x^2 = 20 + 12x + x^2]Subtracting the right side from the left side:[64 + 16x + x^2 - 20 - 12x - x^2 = 0 implies 44 + 4x = 0 implies 4x = -44 implies x = -11]Verification shows that adding (x = -11) results in the terms (-9), (-3), and (-1), which form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of (frac{1}{3}).Thus, the number that is added is (boxed{-11}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-9152f154></div><p class="review-content" data-v-9152f154><span class="icon" data-v-9152f154>🔑:</span>Given that in the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_1 = 2 and a_3 = 6, we can determine the common difference d of the sequence:a_3 = a_1 + 2d 6 = 2 + 2d d = 2Next, we want to find a_4 and a_5 using the common difference d:a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 2 + 3 cdot 2 = 8 a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 2 + 4 cdot 2 = 10Now, let&#39;s add the same number x to a_1, a_4, and a_5.

Let me try to break down the problem step by step.First, let&#39;s understand the rules. Blake and Ruby take turns coloring squares on an infinite grid. Blake goes first, coloring one square blue each turn. Ruby then responds by coloring two squares red. The game continues until Blake decides to stop, at which point Blake&#39;s score is the area of the largest simple polygon made up only of blue squares. The question is, what&#39;s the highest score Blake can ensure regardless of Ruby&#39;s moves?Hmm. So Blake wants to maximize his score, but Ruby is trying to minimize it by coloring squares red, which can block Blake&#39;s potential polygons. Since the grid is infinite, there&#39;s no boundary constraints, but Blake has to balance between building up a large enough blue region and stopping before Ruby can disrupt it too much.Let me think about the turn sequence. Each time Blake colors a square, Ruby gets to color two squares. So, for every blue square Blake places, Ruby can potentially block two strategic spots. That seems like Blake is at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. But maybe Blake can structure his moves in a way that Ruby can&#39;t effectively block all possible expansions.What&#39;s a simple polygon? It&#39;s a shape without holes, where the boundary is a single non-intersecting loop. So, Blake wants a connected region of blue squares that form such a polygon. The larger the area, the higher the score. But Ruby is placing red squares, which can&#39;t be part of the polygon, so they can act as barriers.Since the grid is infinite, maybe Blake can create a growing structure that Ruby can&#39;t completely block. But Ruby can place two red squares each turn, so perhaps she can limit Blake&#39;s expansion in some way.Let me consider some strategies.One approach for Blake is to build a connected blue region, expanding it each turn while trying to prevent Ruby from surrounding or cutting it off. But Ruby can place two red squares each turn, which might be used to block paths or create barriers.Alternatively, Blake might try to create multiple disconnected regions, but since the score is based on the largest single polygon, consolidating into one large area might be better.Wait, but if Blake spreads out, Ruby would have to spread her red squares thin, but then Blake&#39;s largest polygon might still be small. Alternatively, if Blake focuses on a single area, Ruby can focus her red squares to block expansion there.It&#39;s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game. Maybe Blake can use some spiral or snake-like pattern, expanding in a way that Ruby can only block in certain directions, but Blake can then pivot to another direction.But with Ruby placing two red squares each turn, maybe she can block two potential expansion directions each time. So, for each blue square Blake adds, Ruby can block two adjacent squares, perhaps. But Blake can choose different directions.Alternatively, maybe Blake can build a corridor or a path, expanding in one direction, but Ruby can block the front. However, since the grid is 2D, Blake could potentially expand in multiple directions.Wait, but Blake can choose any white square each turn. So maybe he can create a cluster and expand it outward in multiple directions, while Ruby blocks two squares each turn. The key is whether Ruby can block the expansion enough to keep the maximum polygon bounded.But if Blake keeps expanding, can Ruby prevent the polygon from growing indefinitely? Let&#39;s think.Suppose Blake starts at the origin. On his first move, he colors (0,0) blue. Ruby then colors two squares red. Where would she color them? Maybe adjacent to (0,0) to block immediate expansion. Let&#39;s say she colors (1,0) and (0,1) red. Then, on Blake&#39;s next turn, he might color (-1,0) or (0,-1) blue. Ruby would then block those directions. But Blake can keep moving in a spiral or alternate directions.Wait, but each time Blake adds a blue square, Ruby can add two red ones. So over time, the ratio is 1 blue to 2 red squares. But since the grid is infinite, the density might not be too much of an issue, but the local blocking could be.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a sort of &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern where he skips squares, making it harder for Ruby to block. But Ruby can still target key squares.Alternatively, maybe Blake can construct a polygon that loops around, enclosing an area. But to enclose an area, you need a closed loop. However, since the game ends when Blake decides, maybe Blake can create a loop quickly before Ruby can block it.Wait, but creating a loop requires surrounding an area. For example, to make a rectangle, Blake would need to create a perimeter. If Blake can create a loop of blue squares, then the area inside would count as part of the polygon. Wait, but the problem says &quot;unit squares in the largest simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So the polygon is made up of blue squares. So the polygon itself is a connected set of blue squares forming a simple polygon.Wait, actually, in computational geometry, a simple polygon is a non-intersecting polygon. But here, since we&#39;re dealing with unit squares, maybe the largest connected blue region that forms a polygon without holes. But maybe it&#39;s more about the arrangement. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the union of blue squares as a polygon. For example, if you have a set of blue squares, the largest simple polygon that can be formed by their union. But perhaps the key is that the polygon can&#39;t include any red squares. So, even if there&#39;s a blue region with red squares inside, the polygon must exclude those red squares. Wait, but the problem says &quot;containing only blue unit squares&quot;. So the polygon can&#39;t contain any red squares. So if there&#39;s a hole with red squares, the polygon must go around it. But since the grid is infinite, maybe Blake can create a connected blue region without any holes, making the entire connected region a polygon.But perhaps the maximum score is about the size of the largest connected blue region. Wait, but a simple polygon is a single polygonal chain, so maybe even a connected region of blue squares can be considered as a polygon if it&#39;s simply connected. But in grid terms, the area would be the number of squares.Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So, it&#39;s the number of blue squares that can be arranged into a simple polygon. But a simple polygon is a single closed loop without holes. Wait, but in grid squares, how does that translate?Alternatively, maybe the polygon is a shape in the plane whose interior consists of the blue squares. But the exact definition might matter here. If the polygon has to be a simple polygon (no self-intersections) that covers all the blue squares, then the area would be the number of blue squares. But that seems trivial. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s the area of the polygon in the plane, which would be equivalent to the number of squares times the area of each square (which is 1). So maybe it&#39;s just the count.But perhaps the key is that the polygon must consist of blue squares, but can be any shape as long as it&#39;s a simple polygon. So, if Blake has a scattered set of blue squares, the largest simple polygon would be the convex hull or some other arrangement. Wait, but the problem says &quot;containing only blue unit squares&quot;, so all the squares inside the polygon must be blue. Therefore, the polygon can&#39;t enclose any non-blue squares. So, the polygon must be such that all squares inside it are blue. Therefore, the polygon is essentially the boundary of a blue region without any holes or red squares inside.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s the largest simply connected blue region. Since a simple polygon is a single closed loop without holes, then the area would be the number of blue squares in that loop. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Wait, actually, in standard terminology, a simple polygon is a non-intersecting closed polygonal chain. The area of such a polygon would be the number of unit squares it encloses. But the problem says &quot;the number of unit squares in the largest... polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So maybe the polygon is made up of blue squares, but arranged in such a way that they form a simple polygon. Wait, but unit squares are axis-aligned. So a simple polygon made up of unit squares would be a polyomino. But a simple polygon in the geometric sense is different from a polyomino.This is a bit confusing. Let me check the problem statement again: &quot;the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot;Wait, perhaps &quot;simple polygon&quot; here refers to a simply connected polygon, meaning it doesn&#39;t have any holes. So, the largest blue region that is simply connected (i.e., one piece without holes). Then the area would be the number of blue squares in that region. So Blake&#39;s score is the size of the largest connected blue region without any holes.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a geometric polygon whose interior is entirely blue. For example, you could have a polygon drawn on the grid, and all the grid squares inside that polygon must be blue. Then the area would be the number of such squares. In that case, Blake would want to create a large blue region such that there exists a simple polygon covering many blue squares without enclosing any red ones.But since the grid is infinite, if Blake can create an ever-expanding blue region while Ruby can only place two red squares per turn, perhaps Blake can guarantee arbitrarily large scores by outmaneuvering Ruby. But Ruby&#39;s two red squares per turn might be enough to block Blake.Wait, but Blake can choose when to end the game. So Blake&#39;s strategy would be to build up a certain structure that Ruby cannot block, and then end the game once that structure is complete.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a maximum score Blake can guarantee regardless of Ruby&#39;s actions. For example, maybe Blake can always guarantee a score of 4, or 9, or something like that.Let me think of small cases.Suppose Blake places one blue square. Ruby then places two red squares. If Blake ends the game immediately, his score is 1. If he continues, he can try to build more.Suppose Blake places a second blue square adjacent to the first. Ruby would then place two more red squares. If Blake can connect two blue squares, his score would be 2. But if Ruby blocks the connection, maybe Blake can&#39;t connect them. Wait, but Blake can choose where to place his squares. So if Blake starts at (0,0), then on his next turn, he can go to (1,0). If Ruby tries to block by placing red squares between them, but Blake can just go around.Wait, but Ruby has two moves each turn. So after Blake&#39;s first move at (0,0), Ruby can place two reds. Let&#39;s say she places (1,0) and (0,1). Then Blake&#39;s next move could be (-1,0). Ruby then places reds at (-2,0) and (-1,1). Then Blake goes to (0,-1), Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1). It seems like Ruby can block adjacent squares, but Blake can keep moving outward.But in 2D, there are infinitely many directions. So even if Ruby blocks two squares each turn, Blake can choose to expand in another direction. However, the problem is that if Blake wants to form a connected polygon, he needs his blue squares to be connected. If he keeps expanding in different directions, the blue squares might become disconnected, reducing the maximum polygon size.Alternatively, Blake could focus on building a connected cluster. Each time he adds a square adjacent to his existing cluster, Ruby can block two squares around it. But since each blue square added allows Blake to expand in multiple directions, Ruby can&#39;t block all of them.Wait, suppose Blake starts at (0,0). Ruby blocks two adjacent squares. Blake then adds another square in a different direction. Ruby blocks two more. If Blake keeps adding squares in a spiral, each time Ruby can block two adjacent squares, but Blake can keep expanding in the remaining directions.For example, after the first move, Blake has (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1). Blake then goes to (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1). Blake goes to (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1). Blake then goes to (1,1) if it&#39;s not blocked, but Ruby might have blocked (0,1) earlier. Wait, no, Ruby only blocks two each turn. So each turn, Blake adds one, Ruby adds two.So turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Turn 1 Ruby: colors (1,0) and (0,1). Turn 2 Blake: colors (-1,0). Turn 2 Ruby: colors (-2,0) and (-1,1). Turn 3 Blake: colors (0,-1). Turn 3 Ruby: colors (1,-1) and (-1,-1). Turn 4 Blake: colors (1,1). Wait, but (1,1) is white? Ruby hasn&#39;t colored it yet. So Blake can go there. Then Ruby would respond by coloring two squares, maybe around (1,1). So Turn 4 Ruby: colors (2,1) and (1,2). Then Blake can go to (2,0), but that was colored red by Ruby in Turn 1. Hmm, no, (2,0) is still white. Wait, Ruby colored (1,0) red in Turn 1, but (2,0) is still white. So Blake could go to (2,0) on Turn 5. Then Ruby would block around there.But this seems like Blake can keep expanding outward, and Ruby can only block two squares per turn. Since each direction Blake expands, he can choose a new direction where Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked yet. Since the grid is 2D, there are four main directions, but Blake can also go diagonally, but each move is orthogonal, I think, since they&#39;re unit squares. Wait, no, the grid is of unit squares, so moving to adjacent squares is up, down, left, right. Diagonally adjacent isn&#39;t considered adjacent here.Wait, in a grid, each square has four neighbors (up, down, left, right). So if Blake is building a connected cluster, he needs to place each new blue square adjacent to an existing one. Otherwise, the cluster becomes disconnected.But the problem says &quot;simple polygon containing only blue unit squares&quot;. So maybe the blue squares don&#39;t need to be connected? Wait, a simple polygon is a single closed loop, so the blue squares would need to form such a loop. But if the blue squares are scattered, you can&#39;t form a single polygon containing all of them. Therefore, the largest polygon would be formed by connected blue squares.Therefore, Blake needs to create a connected blue region. The size of this region is his score. So, the problem reduces to: starting from zero, each turn Blake adds one connected blue square, Ruby adds two red squares anywhere. Blake can choose to stop anytime. What&#39;s the maximum number of connected blue squares Blake can guarantee.Wait, but connectedness is key. So Blake has to ensure that his blue squares remain connected as he adds them. But Ruby can try to disconnect them by placing red squares between them.Wait, for example, if Blake has two adjacent blue squares, and Ruby places a red square between them, does that disconnect them? No, because the two blue squares are already adjacent. If Ruby places a red square adjacent to them, it doesn&#39;t disconnect. To disconnect, Ruby would need to block a potential path. But in order to disconnect a connected blue region, Ruby would have to separate it into two parts with red squares. But since Blake is adding one square each turn adjacent to the existing cluster, Ruby can&#39;t disconnect the existing cluster. She can only block expansion.Therefore, as long as Blake builds a connected cluster, Ruby can&#39;t disconnect it. She can only prevent it from growing in certain directions. Therefore, Blake&#39;s cluster will always be connected, and his score is the size of that cluster when he decides to stop.But Ruby can constrain the growth of the cluster. Each time Blake adds a square to the cluster, Ruby can block two adjacent squares. But in 2D, there are potentially many directions to grow.Wait, let&#39;s model this as a graph. The grid is a graph with each square as a node connected to its four neighbors. Blake is trying to grow a connected subgraph (blue) by adding one node per turn, while Ruby is adding two blocked nodes (red) per turn. Blake can choose where to add his node, adjacent to the existing blue subgraph. Ruby can choose any two nodes to block.The question is, what&#39;s the maximum size Blake can guarantee his blue subgraph can reach, regardless of Ruby&#39;s blocking.This seems related to the concept of graph growth under adversarial conditions. In such problems, often the maximum size achievable can be determined by analyzing the possible expansion rates.Since Blake adds 1 per turn, Ruby removes 2 per turn (by blocking). But Blake is adding specifically to grow his cluster, while Ruby is trying to block the growth.However, since Blake can choose the direction of growth, maybe he can always find a path to expand. In 2D, with infinite space, even if Ruby blocks some directions, Blake can &quot;snake&quot; around the blocked areas.But is there a way for Ruby to limit Blake&#39;s cluster to a finite size? For example, surrounding it with red squares. However, with Blake adding one per turn and Ruby adding two, the number of red squares around the cluster would grow, but since the perimeter of the cluster increases as it grows, Ruby might not be able to keep up.Wait, the perimeter of a connected cluster on the grid grows proportionally to the square root of its area (if it&#39;s roughly circular). But Ruby is adding two red squares per turn, so her rate of perimeter blocking is linear over time, while the cluster&#39;s perimeter growth is sublinear. Therefore, over time, Ruby can&#39;t block the entire perimeter, so Blake can always find a place to expand.Wait, let&#39;s think more carefully.Suppose Blake&#39;s cluster has an area of n (so n blue squares). The perimeter (number of adjacent white squares) is roughly proportional to the boundary. For a square cluster, the perimeter is about 4*sqrt(n). So, as n increases, the perimeter grows as sqrt(n). Ruby is adding two red squares per turn, so over k turns, she can have placed 2k red squares. If Blake&#39;s cluster has area k (since he adds one per turn), then the perimeter is about 4*sqrt(k). Ruby has placed 2k red squares. For large k, 2k grows faster than 4*sqrt(k), so eventually, Ruby can block the entire perimeter, preventing Blake from expanding. But wait, this seems contradictory.Wait, no. Wait, Blake is adding 1 per turn, so after k turns, the area is k. The perimeter is ~4*sqrt(k). Ruby, in k turns, has placed 2k red squares. So when does 2k exceed 4*sqrt(k)? Solve 2k = 4*sqrt(k) =&gt; k = 2*sqrt(k) =&gt; sqrt(k) = 2 =&gt; k=4. So after k=4, 2k exceeds 4*sqrt(k). Therefore, after 4 turns, Ruby&#39;s red squares outpace the perimeter growth. Therefore, in theory, Ruby could eventually block all perimeter squares.But in reality, Blake is building the cluster, and each turn he can choose where to expand. So even if Ruby is adding two red squares per turn, Blake can choose to expand in a direction where Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked yet.Wait, but as the cluster grows, the perimeter increases, but Ruby&#39;s red squares can be placed anywhere. However, if Ruby focuses her red squares on the perimeter of Blake&#39;s cluster, she can gradually block off all exits.But in an infinite grid, Blake can choose to grow the cluster in a different direction each time, making the perimeter very large in all directions. However, Ruby can only block two squares per turn. So perhaps Blake can always find a way to expand.Wait, here&#39;s a possible strategy for Blake: build a straight line. Each time he adds a square to the end of the line, Ruby can block the next square in that direction, but Blake can then start a new line in another direction. However, since the score is the largest connected cluster, a straight line is connected, but if Blake starts a new direction, it might not be connected to the existing line.Wait, no. If Blake is building a connected cluster, he has to place each new square adjacent to the existing cluster. So he can&#39;t just start a new line somewhere else unless it&#39;s adjacent.Therefore, Blake&#39;s cluster is a connected region, and each expansion is adjacent to it. Ruby can block two potential expansions per turn.But in order to surround the cluster, Ruby needs to block all possible expansions. However, since the cluster can grow in any direction, and Ruby can only block two per turn, Blake can always choose to grow in a direction that Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked yet.Alternatively, perhaps Ruby can prioritize blocking the most &quot;dangerous&quot; directions, forcing Blake into a corridor. But in 2D, there are multiple corridors.Wait, maybe this is similar to a combinatorial game where the second player can&#39;t prevent the first player from building an arbitrarily large structure. For example, in the game of Go, on an infinite board, the first player can always expand.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a known result about such games. But since I don&#39;t recall one, I need to reason it out.Let me consider that each time Blake adds a square to his cluster, the perimeter increases by up to 3 (since adding a square to the cluster can add 3 new perimeter squares: if it&#39;s added to a corner, it has three new edges). Wait, actually, when you add a square adjacent to the cluster, it shares at least one edge with the cluster, so the new perimeter squares are the other three sides. But if the new square is added in a &quot;corner&quot;, it might have two adjacent squares already. Wait, no. If you add a square adjacent to one existing square, then the new square has three new edges, each of which could be adjacent to white squares, hence adding three to the perimeter. But if the new square is between two existing squares, then it might have two adjacent squares, so only two new edges. Wait, maybe on average, adding a square adds two to the perimeter.But regardless, the perimeter grows as the cluster grows. Ruby can block two squares per turn. If the perimeter grows faster than Ruby can block, Blake can always expand. If not, Ruby can eventually block it.Wait, for a 2D cluster, the perimeter scales with the square root of the area. So if the area is n, perimeter is roughly 4*sqrt(n). Blake adds 1 per turn, Ruby blocks 2 per turn. The number of perimeter squares Blake has is growing as sqrt(n), while Ruby is blocking 2 per turn. The rate at which perimeter increases is derivative of sqrt(n) with respect to n, which is 1/(2*sqrt(n)). So as n increases, the rate of perimeter growth decreases. Meanwhile, Ruby is blocking at a constant rate of 2 per turn. Therefore, after some point, Ruby&#39;s blocking will surpass the perimeter growth, and she can start reducing the perimeter.Wait, this seems a bit abstract. Let me think numerically. Suppose after n turns, Blake has n blue squares. The perimeter is roughly 4*sqrt(n). Ruby has placed 2n red squares. If she uses all her red squares to block the perimeter, then after n turns, the number of blocked perimeter squares is 2n. When does 2n exceed 4*sqrt(n)? Solve 2n = 4*sqrt(n) =&gt; n = 2*sqrt(n) =&gt; sqrt(n) = 2 =&gt; n=4. So at n=4, the number of red squares Ruby has placed equals the perimeter. After that, for n&gt;4, 2n &gt; 4*sqrt(n). Therefore, theoretically, after n=4, Ruby could have blocked all perimeter squares. But in reality, Blake is building the cluster, and each turn he can choose where to expand. So even if Ruby is blocking two squares per turn, Blake can choose an unblocked part of the perimeter to expand.But if after n=4, Ruby has enough red squares to block the entire perimeter, how is Blake able to expand? Wait, maybe this analysis is flawed because perimeter isn&#39;t the only consideration. Each time Blake expands, he adds a new square, which creates new perimeter. Ruby can only block two squares per turn, so even if she has blocked previous perimeter squares, Blake can always expand in a new direction.Alternatively, imagine the cluster as a growing circle. Each time Blake adds a layer, the perimeter increases. Ruby is trying to block the perimeter, but since Blake can choose any direction, he can always find an unblocked spot.But in reality, on a grid, the growth isn&#39;t a perfect circle. It&#39;s more like a connected blob. But the key idea is that in 2D, the number of possible expansion directions is large, and Ruby can only block two per turn. Therefore, Blake can always find an unblocked edge to expand.Wait, but over time, Ruby could focus her blocks on creating a barrier in one direction, forcing Blake to go around, but since the grid is infinite, Blake can just choose another direction. Even if Ruby starts building a wall, Blake can go around it, and Ruby can&#39;t block all possible paths.Therefore, perhaps Blake can guarantee an arbitrarily large score, by continuing to expand in directions that Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked. Since Ruby can only block two squares per turn, and each turn Blake can add one, given the 2D grid&#39;s nature, Blake can always snake around Ruby&#39;s blocks.However, the problem says &quot;What is the largest score Blake can guarantee?&quot; If Blake can guarantee any score, the answer would be unbounded. But the problem is likely expecting a finite number, so perhaps my reasoning is flawed.Wait, maybe the key is that when Blake decides to end the game, the score is the area of the largest simple polygon made of blue squares. If Blake&#39;s blue squares are scattered, the largest polygon might be small. But if they&#39;re connected, it&#39;s the size of the connected region.But if Blake can keep expanding a connected region by avoiding Ruby&#39;s blocks, then he could make it as large as he wants. However, Ruby might be able to disconnect the cluster or limit its growth.Wait, earlier, I thought that Ruby can&#39;t disconnect the cluster because Blake is always adding adjacent squares. So as long as Blake builds a connected cluster, Ruby can&#39;t disconnect it. Therefore, the cluster&#39;s size is equal to the number of turns Blake has taken. But Ruby is trying to limit how large it can grow.Wait, no. Wait, Blake is taking turns alternately with Ruby. Each Blake turn, he adds one blue. Each Ruby turn, she adds two reds. So after n turns of Blake, there have been n-1 turns of Ruby (since Blake starts first). Therefore, the number of blue squares is n, and the number of red squares is 2(n-1). If Blake decides to end the game after n turns, his score is n, but Ruby has placed 2(n-1) red squares. However, the positioning of those red squares matters.But if Blake can always, regardless of Ruby&#39;s placement, create a connected blue cluster of size n, then his score is n. The question is, can Blake guarantee any n, or is there a maximum n he can ensure.If Blake can always force the game to reach a cluster size of 4, for example, but Ruby can prevent it from getting to 5, then the answer is 4. But if Blake can always get to any n by playing suitably, then the answer is unbounded.Given that the grid is infinite, and Blake can choose where to place, it seems possible that Blake can always grow his cluster. Here&#39;s a possible strategy:1. Blake starts at (0,0).2. Ruby blocks two adjacent squares, say (1,0) and (0,1).3. Blake moves to (-1,0).4. Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).5. Blake moves to (0,-1).6. Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).7. Blake moves to (1,1). Wait, but (1,1) is two steps away from the existing cluster. No, he needs to place adjacent. So after (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), the next move has to be adjacent to one of those.Wait, if Blake&#39;s cluster is at (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), then the possible expansions are (-2,0), (-1,-1), (0,-2), (1,-1), (0,1), etc. But Ruby has blocked some of these.Wait, let&#39;s track this step by step.Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Cluster size 1.Ruby&#39;s turn 1: colors (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Cluster size 2. Now the cluster is (0,0) and (-1,0).Ruby&#39;s turn 2: colors (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Cluster size 3. Now cluster is three squares: (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1).Ruby&#39;s turn 3: colors (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake wants to expand. The possible adjacent white squares are:From (0,0): (1,0) is red, (0,1) is red, (-1,0) is blue, (0,-1) is blue.From (-1,0): (-2,0) is red, (-1,1) is red, (0,0) is blue, (-1,-1) is red.From (0,-1): (0,-2) is white, (1,-1) is red, (-1,-1) is red, (0,0) is blue.So available adjacent white squares are (0,-2). So Blake must color (0,-2). Cluster size 4.Ruby&#39;s turn 4: colors (0,-3) and (1,-2). Now, from Blake&#39;s cluster at (0,-2), the next possible moves are (0,-3) is red, (-1,-2) is white, (1,-2) is red.So Blake&#39;s next move, Turn 5: He can go to (-1,-2). Cluster size 5.Ruby&#39;s turn 5: colors (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Blake wants to expand. From (-1,-2), possible moves: (-2,-2) is red, (-1,-3) is red, (0,-2) is blue, (-1,-1) is red. So stuck. From (0,-2), can go to (0,-3) red. From (0,-1), can go to (-1,-1) red. From (-1,0), can go to (-2,0) red or (-1,1) red. From (0,0), can go to (1,0) red or (0,1) red. From (0,-1), adjacent reds. So the only available expansion is maybe another direction.Wait, but the cluster is (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (-1,-2). The possible expansions now:From (-1,-2): left to (-2,-2) is red, down to (-1,-3) is red.From (0,-2): down to (0,-3) is red, right to (1,-2) is red.From (0,-1): up to (0,0) is blue, left to (-1,-1) is red, right to (1,-1) is red, down to (0,-2) is blue.From (-1,0): up to (-1,1) is red, left to (-2,0) is red, down to (-1,-1) is red.From (0,0): up to (0,1) is red, right to (1,0) is red, left to (-1,0) is blue, down to (0,-1) is blue.So the entire cluster is surrounded by red squares except perhaps (-1,-2) has no expansion. Wait, maybe there&#39;s another direction.Wait, from (-1,-2), can Blake go up to (-1,-1) which is red. No. From (0,-2), can he go left to (-1,-2) which is blue. So no available expansions. The cluster is completely surrounded by red squares. So Blake cannot expand further, and if he ends the game, his score is 5.But wait, is that possible? In five turns, Blake has a cluster of 5, completely surrounded by red squares. So Ruby managed to block all possible expansions.But this contradicts my earlier thought that Blake can always find a way to expand. Maybe in 2D, with clever play, Ruby can actually block Blake into a finite area.Wait, in the above example, Blake followed a linear path down and left, allowing Ruby to block him. But maybe if Blake had expanded in different directions, he could avoid being surrounded.Alternatively, maybe the key is that if Blake always expands in a spiral or some non-linear fashion, Ruby can&#39;t block all sides.Let me try another approach.Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Cluster size 1.Ruby colors (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Cluster size 2.Ruby colors (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Cluster size 3.Ruby colors (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (0, -2). Cluster size 4.Ruby colors (0, -3) and (1, -2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1, -1). Wait, but (-1,-1) is red. No, can&#39;t do that. Alternatively, Blake colors (-1, -2). Cluster size 5.Ruby colors (-2, -2) and (-1, -3).Turn 6: Blake is stuck as before.Alternatively, maybe Blake should expand in a different direction earlier. For example, after the first few moves, instead of going down, go left or right.Wait, Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake goes to (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake goes to (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake goes to (1,0). But (1,0) is red. Can&#39;t do that. Alternatively, Blake goes to (0, -2). Then Turn 4 Ruby blocks (0, -3) and (1, -2). Then Blake is forced to go to (-1,-2) on Turn 5, which gets blocked.Hmm. It seems like if Ruby focuses on blocking adjacent squares in the direction Blake is moving, she can eventually block him. But in 2D, Blake can change direction.Wait, suppose after Turn 3, Blake&#39;s cluster is (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1). Ruby has blocked (1,0), (0,1), (-2,0), (-1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1). So possible expansions: (0,-2), (-1,-2), (-2,0) is blocked, (-1,1) is blocked, (1,0) is blocked, (0,1) is blocked, (1,-1) is blocked.So Blake could go to (0,-2). Then Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2). Then Blake goes to (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3). Then Blake is stuck.Alternatively, if after Turn 3, Blake decides to go upwards instead. But (0,1) is blocked. Or right, but (1,0) is blocked. So he can&#39;t. So in this path, Blake is forced down and left, leading to being blocked.Alternatively, maybe Blake should have taken a different route earlier. Let&#39;s see.Suppose after the first move (0,0), Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1). Blake&#39;s second move is (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1). Blake&#39;s third move is (0,1). But (0,1) is blocked. Can&#39;t do that. Alternatively, (0,-1). Then Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1). Then Blake&#39;s fourth move is (1,0). Blocked. Hmm.It seems like no matter what Blake does, Ruby can block adjacent squares and eventually corral Blake into a finite area.Wait, but in reality, Blake could &quot;branch out&quot;. For example, after the third move, instead of going down, he could create a new branch.Wait, Blake&#39;s cluster after three turns is (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1). To branch out, he could add a square adjacent to (-1,0) but in a different direction. But (-1,0) has (-2,0) blocked and (-1,1) blocked. So the only available direction is down: (-1,-1), but Ruby blocked that on her third turn.Alternatively, Blake adds a square adjacent to (0,-1), which is (0,-2). Then Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2). Then Blake adds (-1,-1), but it&#39;s blocked. Alternatively, Blake goes to (-1,-2). Then Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3). Now Blake&#39;s cluster is (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (-1,-2). Next move: Blake is stuck.Alternatively, Blake could try to create a 2x2 square. Let&#39;s see:Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-1). But (-1,-1) is red. Can&#39;t. Alternatively, (0,-2). Then Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-1). Still red. Hmm. Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe Blake&#39;s strategy to create a 2x2 square is thwarted by Ruby.Alternatively, Blake focuses on building a cross shape.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (1,0). Blocked. No. (0,-2). Then Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-1). Blocked. No. (-1,-2). Then Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Again, stuck.It seems like no matter how Blake tries to expand, Ruby can block adjacent squares and eventually enclose him. This suggests that Blake can&#39;t guarantee an arbitrarily large score. Then, what&#39;s the maximum he can ensure?In the previous example, Blake reached a cluster size of 5 before being blocked. But maybe there&#39;s a smarter strategy where Blake can create a larger cluster.Wait, let&#39;s try a different approach. Suppose Blake builds a cluster with multiple branches, forcing Ruby to spread her blocks.Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (0,2). Wait, but (0,2) is not adjacent to the existing cluster. He has to place adjacent. So he can&#39;t jump there.Alternatively, Blake colors (0, -2). Ruby blocks (0, -3) and (1, -2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1, -1). Blocked. No. (-1, -2). Ruby blocks (-2, -2) and (-1, -3).Turn 6: Blake colors (1, -2). Blocked. No. (0, -4). Not adjacent. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a longer chain.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake goes to (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake goes to (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 4: Blake goes to (0,-4). Wait, no, needs to be adjacent. So (0,-2) is already there, next is (0,-3) blocked. So Blake can&#39;t go further down. Alternatively, go left from (0,-2): (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 5: Blake can&#39;t expand further. Cluster size 4.Hmm, so in this path, Blake only gets to 4.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a more spread out cluster.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (1,1). But (1,1) is white? But it&#39;s not adjacent to the existing cluster. He can&#39;t place there. He needs to place adjacent to his existing blue squares.His existing blues are (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1). The adjacent whites are (1,0) blocked, (0,1) blocked, (-2,0) blocked, (-1,1) blocked, (0,-2), (1,-1) blocked, (-1,-1) blocked. So only (0,-2) is available.Turn 4: Blake colors (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Blake is stuck. Cluster size 5.So regardless of the path, it seems Blake can only get to size 5 before being blocked. Is there a way to get larger?Wait, perhaps if Blake creates a 2x2 square early on.Let me try:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (1,1). But it&#39;s not adjacent to (0,0). Can&#39;t do that.Alternatively, Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-1). Ruby has blocked (-1,-1) on her second turn. No, Ruby blocked (1,-1) and (-1,-1) on her second turn (after Blake&#39;s second move to (0,-1)). So (-1,-1) is already red.So Blake can&#39;t color (-1,-1). So he can&#39;t complete a 2x2 square.Alternatively, Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake colors (1, -1). But it&#39;s blocked. No.Hmm, this seems tricky. It appears that Ruby can effectively block Blake from forming any large connected clusters beyond size 5.But maybe there&#39;s a different strategy where Blake builds multiple clusters and connects them later. Wait, but the score is the largest connected blue polygon. If Blake has multiple disconnected clusters, the largest one would be the size of the biggest cluster.But if Blake can connect them later, but Ruby can block the connection.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a larger cluster by expanding in two directions.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (1,0). Blocked. No. (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (0,-4). Not adjacent. Can&#39;t. Alternatively, (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Blake is stuck.No, same result.Alternatively, what if Blake alternates expanding in different directions to spread out Ruby&#39;s blocks.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 4: Blake colors (0,2). Not adjacent. Can&#39;t. Must go to (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-0). Already colored. Wait, no. From (-1,0), can go to (-1,-1), but it&#39;s blocked. So Blake colors (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Cluster is (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,-2), (-1,-2). Ruby has blocked all surrounding squares. Score 5.So regardless of the order, Blake seems capped at 5. But wait, is there a different initial sequence?Let me try another approach where Blake builds diagonally.Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,1). Not adjacent to (0,0). Can&#39;t. Must be adjacent. So Blake must go to (-1,0) or (0,-1).Suppose Blake goes to (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1, -1). Adjacent to (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).Wait, now Blake&#39;s cluster is (0,0), (-1,0), (-1,-1). Ruby has blocked (1,0), (0,1), (-2,0), (-1,1), (-2,-1), (0,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-2). Adjacent to (-1,-1). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (0,-2). Blocked. No. From (-1,-2), can go to (-1,-3). Ruby blocks (-1,-3) and something else.Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-3). But Ruby blocks (-1,-4) and (-2,-3).Wait, this seems like Blake can continue expanding downward, but each time he does, Ruby blocks the next square. So cluster size increases by 1 each two turns? Wait, no:Turn 1: size 1Turn 2: size 2Turn 3: size 3Turn 4: size 4Turn 5: size 5Turn 6: size 6Wait, no. Wait, each Blake turn increases the cluster by 1. So after n turns, size is n. But Ruby is placing two reds each turn. So after n turns, Blake&#39;s size is n, Ruby has placed 2(n-1) reds.But in the above example, Blake was able to go to (-1,-1), (-1,-2), (-1,-3), etc., each time Ruby blocking the next in line. But each time Blake adds a new square, he can continue the chain.Wait, let&#39;s track this:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Size 1.Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Size 2.Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,-1). Size 3.Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-2). Size 4.Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-3). Size 5.Ruby blocks (-2,-3) and (0,-3).Turn 6: Blake colors (-1,-4). Size 6.Ruby blocks (-2,-4) and (0,-4).And so on. In this case, Blake is building a vertical line downward from (-1,0) to (-1,-n). Each time, Ruby blocks the square below and one to the side. But Blake can keep moving down. Since the grid is infinite downward, Blake can keep this up indefinitely, creating a vertical line of any length. Therefore, his score can be as large as he wants.Wait, this contradicts the earlier example where Blake was getting blocked. What&#39;s the difference?Ah, in this case, Blake is building a vertical line downward, and each time he adds a square, Ruby blocks the next square downward and one to the side. But Blake can just keep going down:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: (-1,0)Turn 3: (-1,-1)Turn 4: (-1,-2)...Each Turn n: (-1, -(n-2))Ruby responds by blocking (-1, -n) and (-2, -n+1) or something. But Blake can just keep adding to (-1, -k). The key is that as long as Blake is moving in a straight line, Ruby can only block the next square in that line and another square, but Blake can continue past the blocked square by going around.Wait, no. If Blake is moving in a straight line downward, and Ruby blocks the next square each time, then Blake can&#39;t proceed past the blocked square. Wait, in the above example:Turn 1: Blake at (0,0)Turn 2: Blake at (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake at (-1,-1). Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).Turn 4: Blake at (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).Turn 5: Blake wants to go to (-1,-3), but Ruby has already blocked (-2,-3) and (0,-3) on her Turn 5. Wait, no. Let&#39;s track Ruby&#39;s moves carefully.After Blake&#39;s Turn 1: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).After Blake&#39;s Turn 2: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).After Blake&#39;s Turn 3: Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).After Blake&#39;s Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).After Blake&#39;s Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-3). Now, on Ruby&#39;s Turn 5, she can block two squares. She would likely block (-2,-3) and (0,-3), preventing Blake from expanding further down from (-1,-3). Then on Blake&#39;s Turn 6, he can&#39;t go to (-1,-4) because Ruby blocked (0,-3) but (-1,-4) is still white. Wait, no, (-1,-4) is adjacent to (-1,-3), which Blake just colored. So Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked (-1,-4) yet. She blocked (-2,-3) and (0,-3).Therefore, Blake can go to (-1,-4) on Turn 6. Ruby then blocks (-2,-4) and (0,-4). And this can continue indefinitely.Therefore, Blake can create an arbitrarily long vertical line downward, with each new square added at (-1,-n). Ruby can only block the square to the left and right of the new square, but not the square below it. Wait, no. Wait, when Blake adds (-1,-3), Ruby can choose to block (-1,-4) and another square. But in the previous turns, Ruby was blocking (-2,-n) and (0,-n). If she continues that pattern, then she leaves (-1,-(n+1)) open. Therefore, Blake can keep adding to (-1,-(n+1)).Wait, let&#39;s clarify:After Blake colors (-1,-3) on Turn 5, Ruby&#39;s Turn 5: she can block (-1,-4) and another square, say (-2,-3). Then Blake can&#39;t go to (-1,-4), but he can go to (-2,-3) if it&#39;s blocked. Wait, no. If Ruby blocks (-1,-4) and (-2,-3), then Blake&#39;s next move adjacent to (-1,-3) would be (-1,-4) blocked, (0,-3) blocked, (-2,-3) blocked. So he can&#39;t expand further. Therefore, Blake is stuck at (-1,-3).Therefore, if Ruby chooses to block the next square in Blake&#39;s path, she can stop him. But if she continues blocking the left and right, as before, she leaves the path open.Wait, this is a critical point. Ruby&#39;s choice of which squares to block determines whether Blake can continue.If Blake is building a vertical line downward, and each time Ruby blocks the next square in that line and another square, then Blake cannot proceed. But if Ruby instead blocks squares to the left and right, leaving the path downward open, then Blake can continue.But Ruby is trying to minimize Blake&#39;s score, so she would act to block Blake&#39;s expansion. Therefore, she would choose to block the next square in Blake&#39;s path.Therefore, in the vertical line example, if Blake tries to go down, Ruby blocks the square below, stopping him. Then Blake has to find another direction.But if Blake changes direction, Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked those.Wait, suppose after Turn 5, Blake is at (-1,-3), and Ruby has blocked (-1,-4) and (-2,-3). Then Blake can&#39;t go down, but can he go left? (-2,-3) is blocked. Or right? (0,-3) is blocked. So he&#39;s stuck.Alternatively, if Blake, instead of going straight down, weaves left and right.Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 4: (-1,-1). Blocked. Can&#39;t. So (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: (0,-4). Not adjacent. Can&#39;t. (-1,-3). Blocked. Hmm, stuck again.It seems that no matter the strategy, Ruby can contain Blake&#39;s cluster to a finite size, around 5 or 6. Therefore, the maximum score Blake can guarantee is likely a small number like 4, 5, or 6.But how to determine the exact number?Let&#39;s consider that in order to create a cluster of size n, Blake needs to place n blue squares, each adjacent to the existing cluster. Each time he does so, Ruby can block two squares. The key is whether Ruby can block all possible expansion directions before Blake can create a large enough cluster.If we think of each expansion step, Blake adds a square, increasing the cluster&#39;s perimeter by up to 3 (if it&#39;s a &quot;corner&quot; square), but Ruby can block two squares. Over time, Ruby&#39;s blocks can limit the growth.But in reality, each new blue square added by Blake can open up new perimeter squares. However, Ruby can focus her blocks on critical points.Another angle: this is similar to a game of tree growth, where each turn the tree can grow one node, and an adversary can remove two nodes. The question is the maximum size the tree can guarantee. In a tree, the adversary can disconnect parts, but here it&#39;s a connected cluster on a grid, which is more resilient.In graph theory, there&#39;s a concept called the &quot;growth rate&quot; of a graph. In this case, Blake&#39;s cluster is a subgraph growing over time, with an adversary removing potential growth nodes.But perhaps a concrete example will help. Suppose Blake aims to create a 3x3 square. How many turns would that take, and can Ruby block it?A 3x3 square has 9 squares. To build it, Blake needs to place 9 squares. However, each time he places a square, Ruby blocks two. So total squares colored after n turns: n blue and 2(n-1) red.For a 3x3 square, Blake needs 9 turns. Ruby would have placed 16 red squares. The perimeter of a 3x3 square is 16 (each side has 3, but corners are shared). So Ruby could have blocked all perimeter squares. Therefore, Blake can&#39;t expand beyond the 3x3, but could he even build it?To build a 3x3 square, Blake needs to place the center first, then the edges. But Ruby would block the adjacent squares. It&#39;s unlikely Blake can build a 3x3 square without Ruby blocking key squares.Alternatively, the maximum cluster Blake can build is 4 squares in a 2x2 block. Let&#39;s see:Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,-1). Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (0,-1). Blocked. Can&#39;t. Alternatively, (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Blake is stuck. Cluster size 5, not forming a 2x2.Alternatively, a different approach:Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-1). Blocked. Can&#39;t. (0,-2). Ruby blocks (0,-3) and (1,-2).Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-2). Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (-1,-3).Turn 6: Cluster size 5, as before.It seems forming a 2x2 square is impossible because Ruby blocks the necessary fourth square.Therefore, the maximum cluster size Blake can guarantee is likely 4 or 5.Looking online for similar problems, I recall that in certain combinatorial games where players alternately place stones, the second player can sometimes limit the first player&#39;s maximum region to a constant. For example, in the game of Cops and Robbers or certain territorial games.However, in this specific problem, since Blake can choose when to end the game, he can potentially stop once he achieves a certain score. The key is to find the maximum score he can guarantee regardless of Ruby&#39;s actions.If Blake can always create a cluster of size 4, but Ruby can prevent 5, then the answer is 4. Conversely, if Blake can always reach 5, then the answer is 5.In the earlier examples, Blake was able to reach 5 but got blocked at 6. However, Ruby could sometimes block earlier, but Blake might have strategies to reach higher.Wait, another idea. If Blake scatters his blue squares in a way that they can later be connected.For example:Turn 1: (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (2,0). Not adjacent. Can&#39;t.No, must be adjacent. So Blake can&#39;t scatter.Alternatively, Blake must build a connected cluster. Therefore, all his moves have to be adjacent to the existing cluster.Therefore, the cluster remains connected, and Ruby can focus her blocks on the perimeter.Given that, and considering that in the vertical line example, Blake can be blocked at size 5 or 6, but in other examples at size 5.Given the analysis, I think the maximum score Blake can guarantee is 4.Wait, no. In the vertical line example, he can get to 5 or 6. But maybe the correct answer is 4.Alternatively, another way to think about it: each time Blake adds a square, Ruby can prevent two future expansions. Therefore, the number of possible expansions Blake can have is n - 2(n-1) = -n + 2. Wait, that doesn&#39;t make sense.Alternatively, using the Euler characteristic for planar graphs, but that might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, consider that for Blake to create a cluster of size n, he needs at least n perimeter squares to expand. Each turn, Blake adds 1 and Ruby blocks 2. So the number of available perimeter squares after n turns is roughly 4*sqrt(n) - 2(n-1). When does this become negative?Solve 4*sqrt(n) - 2(n-1) &lt; 0.4*sqrt(n) &lt; 2(n - 1)2*sqrt(n) &lt; n - 1Let’s solve for n:Let x = sqrt(n), so 2x &lt; x² - 1x² - 2x - 1 &gt; 0Solving x² - 2x - 1 = 0 gives x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [2 ± 2*sqrt(2)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(2)Positive solution is x = 1 + sqrt(2) ≈ 2.414. Therefore, sqrt(n) &gt; 2.414 → n &gt; (2.414)² ≈ 5.828. So when n &gt; 5.828, the available perimeter becomes negative, meaning Ruby has blocked more than the perimeter. Therefore, for n=6, Blake can&#39;t expand. Therefore, the maximum n Blake can guarantee is 5.But this is a heuristic argument. It suggests that around n=6, Blake can&#39;t expand further. Therefore, he can guarantee a score of 5.But in our earlier examples, Blake was able to reach 5 but not 6. Therefore, the answer might be 4 or 5.But wait, in the vertical line example, if Ruby doesn&#39;t block the next square but instead blocks other squares, Blake can keep going. However, Ruby will act to minimize Blake&#39;s score, so she would block the next square in Blake&#39;s path.Therefore, if Blake is building a vertical line, Ruby blocks the next downward square each time, limiting Blake to size n where after n turns, Ruby has blocked the next square. But since Blake can choose when to end the game, he can stop before being blocked.For example, Blake can build up to size 4, and then end the game before Ruby has a chance to block the fourth square.Wait, let&#39;s track this:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Cluster size 1.Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Cluster size 2.Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 3: Blake colors (-1,-1). Cluster size 3.Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (0,-1).Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-2). Cluster size 4.Ruby blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).At this point, Blake can choose to end the game, scoring 4. If he continues:Turn 5: Blake tries to color (-1,-3). Ruby has already blocked (-2,-3) and (0,-3) on her Turn 5.But wait, Blake&#39;s Turn 5: he wants to color (-1,-3). But Ruby&#39;s Turn 4 blocks were (-2,-2) and (0,-2). Then Ruby&#39;s Turn 5 would happen after Blake&#39;s Turn 5.Wait, the turn order is:Blake&#39;s Turn 1Ruby&#39;s Turn 1Blake&#39;s Turn 2Ruby&#39;s Turn 2...So after Blake&#39;s Turn 4 (cluster size 4), Ruby&#39;s Turn 4 blocks (-2,-2) and (0,-2).If Blake then ends the game, his score is 4.If he continues to Turn 5:Blake&#39;s Turn 5: colors (-1,-3). Now, Ruby&#39;s Turn 5: she can block (-2,-3) and (0,-3).Then Blake&#39;s cluster is size 5, but Ruby has blocked the next squares. If Blake ends the game now, his score is 5.Wait, but Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked (-1,-3) yet. She blocked (-2,-3) and (0,-3), but (-1,-4) is still open. So Blake could continue to Turn 6:Blake&#39;s Turn 6: colors (-1,-4). Ruby&#39;s Turn 6: blocks (-2,-4) and (0,-4).Blake can continue indefinitely, each time adding a square below, and Ruby blocking two squares, but not the next one in Blake&#39;s path.Wait, no. If Blake colors (-1,-3) on Turn 5, Ruby can choose to block (-1,-4) and another square on her Turn 5. If she does, then Blake can&#39;t go further down on Turn 6. But if Ruby instead blocks (-2,-3) and (0,-3), then (-1,-4) is still open, allowing Blake to go there on Turn 6.Therefore, the key is Ruby&#39;s choice. To minimize Blake&#39;s score, Ruby will block the next square in Blake&#39;s path. Therefore, when Blake is moving downward, Ruby blocks (-1,-4) on her Turn 5, preventing Blake from expanding further. Therefore, Blake&#39;s cluster size is 5, and he can&#39;t grow further.But Blake can choose to end the game after Turn 5, scoring 5. If he does, Ruby hasn&#39;t had a chance to block (-1,-4) yet. Wait, no. The turn order is:- Blake&#39;s Turn 5: colors (-1,-3). Cluster size 5.- Ruby&#39;s Turn 5: blocks two squares, say (-1,-4) and something else.Then, if Blake ends the game after his Turn 5, before Ruby&#39;s Turn 5, then his score is 5. But you can&#39;t end the game before Ruby&#39;s turn. The problem states: &quot;The players alternate until Blake decides to end the game.&quot; So Blake can end the game after his turn, before Ruby gets to respond. Therefore, after Blake&#39;s Turn 5, he can end the game, and his score is 5, before Ruby has a chance to block further.Ah, this is crucial. If Blake can end the game immediately after his turn, then Ruby&#39;s subsequent turn doesn&#39;t happen. Therefore, Blake can build up to a certain size, then end the game before Ruby can block the next squares.Let&#39;s see:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Then he can end the game, score 1.Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). Then he can end the game, score 2.Turn 3: Blake colors (0,-1). End game, score 3.Turn 4: Blake colors (-1,-1). End game, score 4.Turn 5: Blake colors (-1,-2). End game, score 5.Turn 6: Blake colors (-1,-3). End game, score 6.But in reality, after each of Blake&#39;s turns, Ruby has a turn except if Blake ends the game immediately.Wait, no. The problem says: &quot;The players alternate until Blake decides to end the game.&quot; So the sequence is:1. Blake&#39;s turn2. Ruby&#39;s turn3. Blake&#39;s turn4. Ruby&#39;s turn...Until Blake decides to stop after his turn.Therefore, if Blake ends the game after his n-th turn, there have been n-1 Ruby turns.Therefore, the number of blue squares is n, and the number of red squares is 2(n-1).Therefore, if Blake wants to maximize his score, he needs to create a cluster of size n, with Ruby having placed 2(n-1) red squares.But the positioning of those red squares is critical.However, since Blake can choose when to stop, he can build up his cluster while minimizing Ruby&#39;s ability to surround it.For example, Blake can follow a strategy where he builds a straight line, and each time he adds a square, Ruby can only block two squares, but can&#39;t block the next in the line if Blake stops before she gets a chance.Wait, let&#39;s clarify with an example:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Ruby hasn&#39;t played yet. If Blake ends now, score 1.Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0). Ruby&#39;s turn: she blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 2: Blake colors (-1,0). If he ends now, score 2.But Ruby has already blocked two squares.Wait, the timing is: Blake goes first, then Ruby, alternating. Blake can choose to end the game after any of his turns.Therefore, the game progresses as:Blake&#39;s turn 1: places blue. If he ends here, score 1.Otherwise, Ruby&#39;s turn 1: places two reds.Blake&#39;s turn 2: places blue. If he ends here, score 2.Otherwise, Ruby&#39;s turn 2: places two reds.And so on.Therefore, if Blake ends the game after his k-th turn, the score is k, and Ruby has had k-1 turns, placing 2(k-1) reds.Therefore, Blake&#39;s maximum guaranteed score is the largest k such that, regardless of Ruby&#39;s placements, he can arrange k blue squares in a connected cluster with Ruby&#39;s 2(k-1) reds not preventing it.The question now is: for any k, can Ruby prevent Blake from having a connected cluster of size k by placing 2(k-1) red squares.Conversely, can Blake find a strategy to build a connected cluster of size k despite Ruby&#39;s 2(k-1) red squares.This is similar to a combinatorial problem where we need to find the maximum k such that a connected graph of size k can be embedded in the grid with 2(k-1) vertices blocked.In graph terms, the grid is a 2D lattice, and we&#39;re asking for the largest k where Blake can embed a connected subgraph of size k, avoiding 2(k-1) blocked vertices.It&#39;s known that in a 2D grid, the number of edges required to disconnect a region is proportional to the perimeter. However, the exact relationship is complex.But intuitively, in order to prevent Blake from achieving a cluster of size k, Ruby needs to block all possible expansions after each step. Since she places two blocks per Blake&#39;s move, after k moves, she&#39;s placed 2(k-1) blocks.If Blake builds a straight line of k squares, the number of perimeter squares is 2 + 2k. For example, a vertical line of k squares has two ends and two sides. But Ruby has placed 2(k-1) blocks. For large k, 2(k-1) is less than 2 + 2k, so Ruby can&#39;t block all perimeter squares. Therefore, Blake can always find a place to expand.But this is a heuristic argument. Let&#39;s see for small k:k=1: perimeter 4. Ruby has 0 blocks. Trivial.k=2: perimeter 6. Ruby has 2 blocks. She can block two perimeter squares, leaving four open.k=3: perimeter 8. Ruby has 4 blocks. Can she block four perimeter squares, leaving four open. Blake can expand.k=4: perimeter 10. Ruby has 6 blocks. Can she block six perimeter squares, leaving four open. Blake can still expand.Wait, this suggests that Ruby can&#39;t block all perimeter squares, so Blake can keep expanding.But earlier examples suggested that Blake gets blocked. But those examples depended on Ruby&#39;s strategy.However, if Blake uses a spiral or snake-like pattern, changing direction each time Ruby blocks a direction, he can always find a new expansion path.Therefore, perhaps Blake can guarantee any score, making the answer unbounded. However, the problem states &quot;What is the largest score Blake can guarantee?&quot; implying a finite answer.This is confusing. I need to resolve this contradiction.Upon reviewing, I realize that when Blake builds a straight line, even though Ruby blocks two squares per turn, the perimeter of the line increases sufficiently that Ruby can&#39;t block all potential expansion directions. Therefore, Blake can keep expanding the line by turning directions when blocked.Alternatively, consider that in order to enclose a cluster of size k, Ruby needs to place blocks around its perimeter. The number of perimeter squares is O(k), but Ruby only has O(k) blocks (2(k-1)). For a 2D cluster, the perimeter is proportional to sqrt(k), so 2(k-1) grows much faster than sqrt(k). Therefore, for large k, Ruby has more than enough blocks to surround the cluster, but Blake can choose to spread out the cluster to make the perimeter large.Wait, the key is whether the perimeter grows faster than Ruby&#39;s blocks. If Blake&#39;s cluster is a line, the perimeter grows linearly with k, and Ruby&#39;s blocks grow as 2(k-1). Therefore, perimeter is ~2k + 2, blocks are ~2k. So perimeter minus blocks is ~2. Therefore, Blake can always have two squares to expand into.Wait, for a straight line of k squares, the perimeter is 2k + 2. Ruby has placed 2(k-1) blocks. Therefore, available perimeter squares are 2k + 2 - 2(k-1) = 4. So there are always four perimeter squares available. Therefore, Blake can always expand by choosing one of them.Therefore, this suggests that Blake can keep expanding indefinitely along a line, with Ruby unable to block all perimeter squares,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s dive into this problem. So, Blake and Ruby are playing a game on an infinite grid where they take turns coloring squares blue and red respectively. Blake goes first, coloring one square blue each turn, while Ruby colors two squares red on her turn. Blake can end the game whenever he wants, and his score is the area of the largest simple polygon made up only of blue squares. The question is, what&#39;s the maximum score Blake can guarantee, no matter how Ruby plays?Hmm, okay. So first off, since the grid is infinite, we don&#39;t have to worry about running out of space. But Blake wants to maximize his polygon&#39;s area, while Ruby is trying to block him by coloring squares red. Since Ruby can color two squares each turn to Blake&#39;s one, Blake needs a strategy that can counteract Ruby&#39;s interference. The key here is figuring out how Blake can position his blue squares in such a way that Ruby can&#39;t effectively block the formation of a large polygon.Let me start by recalling what a simple polygon is. A simple polygon is a non-intersecting closed shape with straight sides. In the context of the grid, each side of the polygon would align with the grid lines, and the polygon would enclose only blue squares. The area would be the number of unit squares inside this polygon.Since Blake can choose when to end the game, he needs to balance between placing enough blue squares to form a large polygon and ending before Ruby can disrupt his plans too much. But Ruby is coloring two squares each turn, so if Blake takes too long, Ruby could potentially block all possible growth directions.I think the key here is that Blake needs to create a structure that&#39;s resilient to Ruby&#39;s interference. Maybe something like building a spiral or a convex shape where Ruby can&#39;t easily block the expansion. Alternatively, Blake could spread out his blue squares in a way that Ruby can&#39;t block all possible connections.But wait, a polygon needs to be a single, connected shape. So Blake can&#39;t have disconnected blue squares; they need to form a continuous region. Therefore, Blake must ensure that his blue squares are connected, and that Ruby doesn&#39;t manage to split them apart or block the expansion.Let&#39;s think about the turn order. Blake starts, coloring one square blue. Then Ruby colors two red. Then Blake colors another blue, Ruby two red, and so on. So each &quot;round&quot; consists of Blake placing one and Ruby placing two. The ratio is 1:2. Therefore, over time, Ruby can potentially block twice as much as Blake can build. But since Blake can choose when to end the game, maybe he can build up enough blue squares in a localized area before Ruby can block all exits.Alternatively, maybe Blake can construct a polygon incrementally by expanding in multiple directions, forcing Ruby to spread her red squares thin. For example, if Blake starts building in four different directions, Ruby would have to block each direction, but with only two red squares per turn, she can&#39;t block all four directions every time. So Blake might be able to outpace her by expanding in more directions than Ruby can handle.Wait, but polygons are single connected regions. So Blake can&#39;t have multiple separate arms; they need to be connected. So maybe building a sort of growing spiral or a convex shape that expands outward. Each time Blake adds a square, he extends the perimeter, and Ruby can block some of the perimeter, but Blake can choose which parts to extend.Alternatively, maybe a checkerboard pattern? But no, a checkerboard would have alternating colors, but the polygon needs to contain only blue squares. So maybe Blake needs to create a solid block of blue squares, but Ruby will be trying to surround it with red squares. However, since the grid is infinite, Blake can always move to a new area if Ruby starts surrounding him.Wait, but if Blake is trying to make a single polygon, he can&#39;t just jump to a new area because that would be disconnected. So he needs to keep expanding from the existing blue region.So maybe Blake&#39;s strategy is to create a convex region, like a rectangle, and expand it step by step, while Ruby tries to block the expansion by placing red squares on the perimeter. But since Blake can choose when to end the game, he can wait until he has a certain size, then end it before Ruby can block too much.But how much can Ruby interfere? Let&#39;s think about a specific example. Suppose Blake starts at the origin, coloring (0,0) blue. Ruby then colors two squares red, maybe adjacent to (0,0) to try to block expansion. Then Blake colors another square adjacent to his existing blue square, say (1,0). Ruby then colors two more squares. If Blake keeps expanding in one direction, Ruby can block that direction. But if Blake expands in multiple directions, Ruby can&#39;t block all of them.Wait, but Ruby can place two red squares each turn. So if Blake is expanding in two directions, Ruby can block both. If Blake expands in three directions, Ruby can block two of them. So the next turn, Blake can expand in the remaining direction. Hmm, maybe.Alternatively, perhaps Blake can create a sort of &quot;shield&quot; around his growing polygon, where he surrounds his blue squares with additional blue squares so that Ruby can&#39;t easily place red squares to block. But given that Ruby can place two red squares each turn, this might not be feasible.Wait, another thought: since the grid is infinite, Blake could create a path that snakes through the grid, always leaving multiple options for expansion. Ruby can block some of those options, but Blake can always choose another path. However, building a polygon requires enclosing an area, not just a path. So maybe Blake needs to create a loop, but loops require a certain amount of squares.Alternatively, maybe the problem is similar to territory capture in Go, where players alternately place stones to enclose areas. However, in this case, Blake is placing blue stones, Ruby is placing red stones, and Blake wants to enclose as much area as possible with blue stones. The difference is that in Go, stones can be captured, but here, once a square is colored, it&#39;s fixed.But in Go, the score is based on enclosed territory minus captured stones. Here, it&#39;s purely the area of the polygon containing only blue squares. So Blake needs to form a closed loop of blue squares with as much area inside as possible, without any red squares inside.But the problem states &quot;largest simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So the polygon itself is made up of blue squares? Wait, no. Wait, the wording says &quot;containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So the polygon is a simple polygon (a closed loop) such that all the unit squares inside the polygon are blue. The polygon&#39;s boundary can be along the edges of the grid squares. So the area is the number of blue squares entirely enclosed within the polygon.Wait, but then the blue squares don&#39;t necessarily have to form a connected region? Wait, no. Because the polygon is a single connected region. Wait, but the problem says &quot;containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So all the squares inside the polygon must be blue. So the polygon is a region where every square inside is blue, and the boundary is a simple polygon.Therefore, Blake&#39;s score is the area (number of squares) of the largest such polygon. So Blake can choose to end the game when he has arranged blue squares in such a way that there exists a large polygon enclosing only blue squares, with the maximum area.But Blake is placing one square per turn, Ruby is placing two red squares. So Blake needs to place blue squares in positions that allow for such a polygon, while Ruby is trying to place red squares to break potential polygons or limit their size.Given that Blake can choose when to end the game, he can wait until he has placed N blue squares, but Ruby has placed 2*(N-1) red squares (since Blake goes first, so if Blake has placed N blue squares, Ruby has had N-1 turns to place 2*(N-1) red squares).Therefore, the total number of colored squares is N + 2*(N-1) = 3N - 2. But since the grid is infinite, the challenge is not about filling space but about arranging the blue squares in a way that a large polygon can be formed without red squares inside.So perhaps the key is that Blake can create a rectangular region. For example, if Blake can create a rectangle of blue squares with dimensions m x n, then the area would be m*n. To create such a rectangle, Blake needs to place blue squares along the perimeter, but Ruby can place red squares inside to ruin the area.Wait, no. If Blake wants a rectangle (or any polygon) containing only blue squares, then any red square inside the intended polygon would ruin it. Therefore, Blake needs to ensure that the entire area inside the polygon is filled with blue squares, and that Ruby hasn&#39;t placed any red squares there.But since Ruby can see where Blake is placing his blue squares, she can target the interior of any potential polygon. Therefore, Blake needs to build up the perimeter and the interior of a polygon in such a way that Ruby cannot place red squares inside before Blake can fill it.Alternatively, maybe Blake can build a polygon where the interior is already filled with blue squares as he builds the perimeter. For example, starting from a corner and expanding outward, filling in the interior as he goes.Wait, but each turn Blake can only place one blue square. So if he wants to build a 2x2 square, he needs four turns to place the four corners, but Ruby would have placed 2*3=6 red squares in the meantime. But those red squares could be anywhere, so maybe Blake can place his squares in a way that Ruby doesn&#39;t know where the interior will be.Alternatively, Blake could work on multiple potential polygons at once, forcing Ruby to split her red squares between them. However, since Blake can choose when to end the game, he could focus on one polygon once it&#39;s sufficiently large.Wait, but if Blake is working on multiple regions, Ruby can block each one. Maybe the optimal strategy is to focus on a single growing region.Let me think about a spiral strategy. Blake starts at a central square and spirals outward, each turn adding a square to the perimeter. Ruby can try to block the spiral, but since Blake is adding one per turn and Ruby two, maybe Blake can maintain the spiral&#39;s growth by choosing directions that Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked.Alternatively, if Blake builds a convex shape like a diamond, expanding outward each layer. Each layer requires more squares, but Ruby can block some of the expansion points. However, with each layer, the number of possible expansion points increases, so Ruby can&#39;t block all of them.For example, the first layer around the initial square is 4 squares. If Blake starts building a diamond, each layer adds a ring around it. The number of squares in each layer grows quadratically, but Blake is only placing one per turn. Wait, maybe not feasible.Alternatively, Blake can create a long corridor, expanding in one direction. Ruby can block the sides, but Blake can continue forward. However, a corridor is a 1xN rectangle, which has area N. But if Ruby blocks in front, Blake can turn. But a polygon needs to be closed, so a corridor isn&#39;t a polygon unless it loops back.Alternatively, Blake can create a circular or polygonal shape, but again, the challenge is closing it without Ruby blocking the closure.Wait, maybe the maximum score Blake can guarantee is 4. Let me see. If Blake places four blue squares in a 2x2 square. He can do this in four turns. Ruby, in the meantime, has placed 2*3=6 red squares. If Ruby doesn&#39;t block the fourth square, then Blake can complete the 2x2 square, which has area 4. But Ruby might try to block one of the squares. However, Blake can choose the order in which he places the squares.For example, turn 1: Blake places (0,0). Turn 2: Ruby places two reds, say (1,0) and (0,1). Turn 3: Blake places (0,2). Turn 4: Ruby places two more reds. Turn 5: Blake places (2,0). Turn 6: Ruby places two reds. Turn 7: Blake places (2,2). Now, if Blake has placed four squares: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). That&#39;s a square, but the interior is not filled. So the area would be zero? Wait, no. Wait, the polygon must contain only blue squares. If Blake has four blue squares at the corners, can he form a polygon that encloses the area between them?But the problem states &quot;unit squares&quot;, so the polygon is made up of unit squares. Wait, maybe the polygon is a simple polygon whose edges are along the grid lines, and all the unit squares inside the polygon must be blue. So if Blake has four blue squares forming the corners of a rectangle, but the interior is white or red, then the area would be zero because the interior isn&#39;t blue.Therefore, to have a non-zero area, Blake needs to have all the squares inside the polygon be blue. Therefore, he can&#39;t just have a hollow rectangle; he needs the interior filled with blue squares.So, for example, a 2x2 square of blue squares would have an area of 4, all blue. If Blake can place four blue squares in a 2x2 block without Ruby placing any red squares inside, then his score would be 4. But Ruby gets to place two red squares each turn. So if Blake is trying to build a 2x2 block, Ruby can place red squares in the positions Blake is trying to fill.Let&#39;s walk through this:Turn 1: Blake colors (0,0) blue.Turn 2: Ruby colors two squares red. She might anticipate Blake is building a 2x2 and color (0,1) and (1,0).Turn 3: Blake wants to color (1,1) to complete the 2x2, but Ruby has already blocked (0,1) and (1,0). Alternatively, Blake could color (1,0), but Ruby might have already colored it red.Wait, in Turn 2, Ruby can choose any two white squares. If Blake starts at (0,0), Ruby&#39;s best move is to block adjacent squares to prevent expansion. So she might color (1,0) and (0,1).Then Turn 3: Blake can try to color (-1,0) or (0,-1), but if he does, Ruby can block those next turn.Alternatively, Blake could color a square diagonally, like (1,1). Then Turn 4: Ruby can block two more squares. If Blake is trying to form a 2x2, he needs (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But Ruby has already blocked (0,1) and (1,0), so Blake can&#39;t complete the 2x2. Therefore, the maximum he can get is a 1x1 square, area 1, but maybe he can connect diagonally?Wait, but a polygon must be a simple polygon, which is a closed loop without holes. A single square is a polygon of area 1. If Blake connects two squares diagonally, that&#39;s not a polygon. Each square must be connected edge-to-edge.Wait, no. A polygon is defined by its boundary. So even if the blue squares are disconnected, can the polygon enclose multiple disconnected blue squares? Wait, the problem says &quot;containing only blue unit squares&quot;. So all unit squares inside the polygon must be blue. So if Blake has multiple blue squares, but they are separate, he can&#39;t form a polygon that contains all of them unless they are connected in a single region.Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;the number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So the polygon is a single simple polygon, and all the unit squares inside this polygon must be blue. The blue squares don&#39;t have to form the polygon themselves; the polygon is just a boundary, and inside that boundary, all squares must be blue.Therefore, Blake could have a large contiguous area of blue squares, and then the largest polygon would be the boundary around that area. Alternatively, even if the blue squares are scattered, the largest polygon that doesn&#39;t include any non-blue squares would be around a cluster of blue squares.But the challenge is that Ruby is placing red squares, which Blake must exclude from his polygon. Therefore, to maximize his score, Blake needs to create a region of blue squares that is as large as possible without any red squares inside, and then form a polygon around that.But since Blake and Ruby are alternately placing squares, Blake needs to place his blue squares in such a way that Ruby can&#39;t place red squares inside the area Blake intends to enclose.One strategy for Blake might be to build a cluster of blue squares where he fills in the interior as he builds the perimeter, so that Ruby doesn&#39;t have a chance to place red squares inside.For example, if Blake starts building a 3x3 square. He needs to place 9 blue squares. However, in the time he takes to place those 9 squares, Ruby would have placed 2*8=16 red squares. But since the grid is infinite, those red squares could be anywhere. If Blake is methodically filling in a 3x3 grid, Ruby could place red squares in the remaining spots of the 3x3 grid, thereby preventing Blake from completing it.Alternatively, Blake could create a sort of &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern where he skips certain squares, making it harder for Ruby to predict where to place red squares. But this might not be effective since Ruby can place two red squares each turn, potentially blocking multiple areas.Wait, perhaps a better approach is for Blake to create a long, thin polygon, like a rectangle that&#39;s one square wide but many squares long. For example, a 1xn rectangle. Each turn, Blake adds a square to the end of the rectangle. Ruby can only block two squares per turn, so if Blake is extending in one direction, Ruby can block that direction, but Blake can then start extending in another direction.But a rectangle that&#39;s 1xn has an area of n. However, to form a polygon around it, the area would actually be n, since it&#39;s just a line of blue squares. Wait, no—if it&#39;s a 1xn rectangle of blue squares, then the largest polygon containing only blue squares would be the individual squares themselves, each of area 1, unless they form a connected region. Wait, but a connected region of blue squares can have a polygon around them. For example, a 1x2 rectangle of blue squares can be enclosed in a 2x1 rectangle polygon, area 2. But since all the squares inside the polygon are blue, that&#39;s acceptable.Wait, actually, if you have a connected region of blue squares, the minimal polygon enclosing them would be their convex hull, but since they&#39;re on a grid, it&#39;s a bit different. The area would be the number of blue squares if they form a solid block. If they&#39;re spread out, the area would be the number of squares enclosed by the polygon, which must all be blue.Therefore, to maximize his score, Blake wants as large a connected blue region as possible, with no red squares inside it. The challenge is that Ruby is placing two red squares each turn, which could be placed inside the area Blake is trying to claim.So maybe the key is that Blake can create regions faster than Ruby can invalidate them. For example, if Blake can create a 2x2 block in four moves, but Ruby can only block two squares per Blake&#39;s move, so over four turns, Ruby can block 8 squares, but Blake is only trying to protect four. Wait, but Ruby can choose where to place her red squares. If she focuses on the area Blake is building, she can specifically target the squares Blake needs.Alternatively, Blake could use a strategy of building multiple small regions, forcing Ruby to split her red squares. However, since the score is based on the largest single polygon, having multiple small regions doesn&#39;t help unless they can be combined into a larger one without including red squares.Another thought: since the grid is infinite, Blake can always start building a new region somewhere else if Ruby blocks his current one. However, to form a large polygon, he needs to have a contiguous region. If he keeps switching regions, he can&#39;t build up a large contiguous area.Alternatively, Blake could build in a way that each new blue square is adjacent to the previous ones, forming a growing connected region. Ruby can place red squares on the perimeter of this region, but Blake can choose to expand in a different direction each time, outpacing Ruby&#39;s ability to block.For example, imagine Blake starts at (0,0). Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1). Blake then goes to (-1,0). Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1). Blake goes to (0,-1). Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (-1,-1). Blake goes to (1,1). Wait, but Ruby might have blocked that. This seems like a cat-and-mouse game where Blake can&#39;t build a significant cluster because Ruby is always blocking nearby squares.But maybe if Blake uses a spiral strategy, moving outward in a spiral, each time placing a blue square next to the previous one but in a spiral pattern. Ruby can block two squares per turn, but as the spiral grows, the number of possible expansion points increases, so Ruby can&#39;t block them all.For instance, after a few turns, Blake&#39;s spiral has several arms. Ruby can block two of them, but Blake can continue expanding the unblocked ones. Each time Blake adds a square, the perimeter increases, giving more options for expansion. Therefore, after a certain point, Blake can always find a place to expand that Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked yet.In such a case, the area enclosed by the spiral could grow indefinitely, but Ruby can still place red squares inside the spiral if Blake isn&#39;t careful. Wait, but if Blake is building the perimeter, the interior would be white or red. To have a polygon containing only blue squares, the interior must be filled with blue. So Blake needs to both build the perimeter and fill the interior, which would take more turns.Alternatively, maybe Blake can build a solid rectangle. For example, a 3x3 square with all interior squares filled. That would take 9 turns. In the meantime, Ruby has placed 16 red squares. But if Blake is working on filling the interior, Ruby could place red squares in the interior before Blake can fill them. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, Blake could focus on building a long, winding corridor of blue squares, snaking through the grid. Each turn, he adds a square to the corridor. Ruby can block adjacent squares, but the corridor can turn directions, requiring Ruby to spread her blocks. However, a corridor is just a 1xN rectangle, which as a polygon would have an area of N. But since it&#39;s a line, the actual enclosed area would be zero? Wait, no. If it&#39;s a connected line of blue squares, the largest polygon enclosing only blue squares would just be each individual square, so area 1 each. To have a larger area, the blue squares need to form a 2D region, not just a line.Therefore, Blake needs to create a 2D region of blue squares. The minimal 2D region is a 2x2 square, area 4. To create that, Blake needs to place four blue squares in a 2x2 block. However, as we saw earlier, Ruby can block this by placing red squares in the critical positions.But maybe Blake can trick Ruby into not blocking the right squares. For example, if Blake starts placing squares in a cross shape, Ruby might block the ends of the cross, allowing Blake to fill in the center.Wait, let&#39;s outline a possible sequence:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby places two reds, maybe (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0).Turn 4: Ruby places (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1).Turn 6: Ruby places (1,-1) and (0,-2).Turn 7: Blake places (1,1). If Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked this.But Ruby might have blocked (1,1) already. Alternatively, Blake could place (1,-1) if Ruby didn&#39;t block it.This seems too vague. Maybe a better approach is to think in terms of graph theory or something. Each blue square is a node, and connectivity is through adjacent squares. Ruby is trying to disconnect or prevent Blake from forming cycles.But the key is forming a cycle (polygon) with all interior squares blue. So Blake needs to form a cycle of blue squares such that the interior is also all blue. But to do that, he needs to both create the perimeter and fill the interior, but Ruby can attack either.Wait, perhaps another angle. Since Blake can end the game whenever he wants, he can choose the optimal time. Suppose he uses a strategy where he builds a cluster of blue squares in such a way that Ruby cannot place red squares inside the cluster. Then, once the cluster is large enough, he ends the game.How can Blake ensure that Ruby doesn&#39;t place red squares inside his cluster? By building the cluster in such a way that all interior squares are already colored blue before Ruby can get to them.For example, if Blake builds a square layer by layer, filling in each layer completely before moving outward. So first, he fills a 1x1 square (just (0,0)). Then a 3x3 square, which requires 8 more squares. But Ruby would have placed 2*8=16 red squares in the time he takes to place those 8. But Blake could intersperse filling the perimeter and the interior.Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s think of it step by step.To build a 3x3 solid blue square:1. Turn 1: Blake places (0,0). Interior: just (0,0). Ruby can&#39;t place red inside yet.2. Turn 2: Ruby places two reds. Maybe she starts surrounding (0,0).3. Turn 3: Blake places (1,0). Now the perimeter is expanding.4. Turn 4: Ruby places two more reds.5. Turn 5: Blake places (0,1).6. Turn 6: Ruby places two reds.7. Turn 7: Blake places (-1,0).8. Turn 8: Ruby places two reds.9. Turn 9: Blake places (0,-1).At this point, Blake has a plus shape. The interior is still just (0,0). To make a 3x3, he needs to fill in the perimeter and the inner squares. But Ruby could have placed reds in the inner squares if Blake didn&#39;t fill them first.Alternatively, if Blake focuses on filling a 2x2 square:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks two.Turn 3: Blake goes to (1,0)Turn 4: Ruby blocks two.Turn 5: Blake goes to (1,1)Turn 6: Ruby blocks two.Turn 7: Blake goes to (0,1)Now, Blake has four blue squares in a square, but depending on Ruby&#39;s blocks, she might have placed red in one of these. Wait, if Blake is methodically placing the four corners, Ruby can block them one by one.Alternatively, Blake could place adjacent squares to form a 2x2:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (1,1)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2)Turn 5: Blake places (0,1) if possible, but Ruby blocked it. So maybe (0,-1)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (-1, -1) and (0,-2)Turn 7: Blake places (-1, 0)This isn&#39;t forming a 2x2. It seems like Ruby can effectively block Blake from forming any 2x2 square by anticipating his moves.Alternatively, Blake could be sneaky and start building in a different direction. Suppose after the first two turns:Turn 1: Blake at (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby at (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake at (-1, 0)Turn 4: Ruby at (-2,0) and (-1,1)Turn 5: Blake at (0, -1)Turn 6: Ruby at (1,-1) and (0,-2)Turn 7: Blake at (1,1). If Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked this.But Ruby, on her turns, might choose to block (1,1) earlier. For example, on Turn 4 or Turn 6.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a diagonal 2x2. For example:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 3: (1,1)Turn 5: (2,2)Turn 7: (3,3)But this is just a diagonal line, not a 2x2 square.Wait, another idea: Blake can create a &quot;domino&quot; tiling, two squares at a time. But he only places one per turn. Hmm.Alternatively, use the fact that Ruby can only block two squares per turn, so if Blake creates multiple potential spots for expansion, Ruby can&#39;t block them all. For example, Blake starts at (0,0). Then he creates branches in four directions. Each time Blake adds a square in a new direction, Ruby has to block two, but Blake can keep expanding in the remaining directions.But again, forming a polygon requires closing the loop. Maybe Blake can create a circuitous path that eventually loops back, enclosing an area. Since Ruby can only block two squares per turn, Blake can eventually complete the loop before Ruby can block all possible paths.For example, Blake starts creating a spiral. Each turn, he adds a square to the spiral, moving clockwise. Ruby can block two squares ahead, but Blake can adjust his path. After several turns, Blake can complete a loop around a central area. Since Ruby was blocking two per turn, but the perimeter of the loop increases as Blake builds it, Blake can find a gap to close the loop.Once the loop is closed, the area inside is whatever was there. If Blake hasn&#39;t placed blue squares inside, then the area would be zero. But if he managed to fill the interior as he built the perimeter, then the area would be the number of blue squares inside. However, filling the interior would take additional turns, during which Ruby can place red squares inside.This seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a mathematical way to determine the maximum area Blake can guarantee regardless of Ruby&#39;s moves.I recall that in combinatorial game theory, sometimes the best you can do is proportional to the number of moves you have versus the opponent. Since Blake places 1 per turn, Ruby places 2 per turn. So over n turns, Blake has n blue squares, Ruby has 2(n-1) red squares. Therefore, the total number of colored squares is 3n - 2. But since the grid is infinite, positioning matters more than quantity.Alternatively, think of it as Blake trying to claim territory while Ruby tries to disrupt. The question is similar to determining the maximum territory Blake can enclose that Ruby cannot invade.In the game of Go, a similar concept exists with making eyes to create alive groups, but this is different.Alternatively, consider that in order to enclose an area of k squares, Blake needs at least 4k perimeter squares (for a square shape). But each perimeter square takes one turn, and Ruby can block two per turn. So if Blake wants to enclose k area, he needs roughly 4k perimeter squares. The time taken would be 4k turns, during which Ruby places 2*(4k - 1) red squares. But 4k vs 8k - 2, which is not favorable for Blake.Alternatively, maybe the perimeter scales with the square root of the area. For a square of side length m, the perimeter is 4m, and the area is m². So if Blake wants to enclose an area of m², he needs 4m perimeter squares. The time taken would be 4m turns, Ruby places 2*(4m - 1) red squares. So 4m vs 8m - 2. So again, Ruby&#39;s squares outnumber Blake&#39;s.Therefore, perhaps Blake cannot enclose any non-trivial area because Ruby can block all his attempts. But that can&#39;t be right, because the problem states Blake can end the game whenever he wants. So maybe he can create a small area quickly before Ruby can block.For example, a 2x2 area requires 4 blue squares. If Blake can place four squares in a 2x2 block before Ruby can place any reds inside, then he can score 4. But Ruby gets to place two reds per Blake&#39;s turn. So if Blake takes four turns to place the four corners, Ruby has three turns to place six red squares. If she places them in the 2x2 area, she can ruin it.But maybe Blake can place the four squares in such a way that Ruby doesn&#39;t know where the 2x2 will be. For example, Blake starts placing squares in different parts of the grid, then suddenly connects them into a 2x2.But Ruby can see all Blake&#39;s moves and will react accordingly. So if Blake starts placing squares in a dispersed manner, Ruby can place reds between them to prevent connection.Alternatively, Blake can focus on a local area. Suppose Blake&#39;s first four moves are all in a 2x2 area. Turn 1: (0,0). Turn 3: (0,1). Turn 5: (1,0). Turn 7: (1,1). During these turns, Ruby has placed 2, 4, 6 red squares. If she focuses on the 2x2 area, she could have placed reds in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), etc., preventing Blake from completing the 2x2.Alternatively, Blake could vary his placement order. For example:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (0,2)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2)Turn 5: Blake places (2,0)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,0) and (2,1)Turn 7: Blake places (2,2)Now, Blake has (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). This forms a square, but the interior is not filled. If he tries to fill the interior, Ruby has likely already placed reds there.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create an L-shape and then close it into a rectangle. But again, Ruby would block the closure.Another angle: The problem says &quot;simple polygon containing only blue unit squares&quot;. A polygon can have any shape, not necessarily axis-aligned. So maybe Blake can create a polygon with diagonal sides, enclosing blue squares in a non-rectangular shape. However, the unit squares are still axis-aligned, so a polygon with diagonal sides would cut through squares, but the requirement is that all unit squares entirely inside the polygon are blue.Therefore, even a diagonal polygon would require that the squares it encloses are blue. So maybe a diamond shape rotated 45 degrees. But building such a shape would still require placing blue squares in a rotated rectangle.However, regardless of the polygon&#39;s shape, Blake needs to place blue squares in such a way that a large contiguous area is covered without red squares inside. The core challenge remains the same.Perhaps the answer is that Blake can guarantee a score of 4. Here&#39;s why: If Blake focuses on creating a 2x2 block, he can do it in four turns. However, Ruby can place six red squares in that time. But if Blake varies the order in which he places the squares, maybe Ruby can&#39;t block all four.Wait, let&#39;s try:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (1,1).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2).Turn 5: Blake places (0,1).But Ruby blocked (0,1) on Turn 2. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (0,-2).Turn 7: Blake places (1,0). But Ruby blocked that on Turn 2.Hmm, this is tricky. It seems like Ruby can effectively block Blake from forming a 2x2 by anticipating his moves. If Blake starts in the center, Ruby blocks adjacent squares. If Blake moves outward, Ruby blocks those.Alternatively, Blake could place squares in a way that doesn&#39;t form a 2x2 until the last moment. For example:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 3: (2,0)Turn 5: (0,2)Turn 7: (2,2)Now, these four squares form a 2x2 block with the center at (1,1). If Ruby didn&#39;t block (1,1), Blake could then place it, but Ruby might have already done so.Wait, but to form the 2x2, the four corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). The center is (1,1), but the actual 2x2 block would require those four corners plus the center? No, a 2x2 block is four squares: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So Blake&#39;s above example is a larger square, but the 2x2 is different.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s confusion between a 2x2 square (4 squares) and a square with side length 2 (which would have 4 squares on the perimeter and an empty center). To have a 2x2 solid square, you need four squares: two rows of two. So positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). To build this, Blake needs to place these four squares. Ruby can block two per turn. If Blake takes four turns to place them, Ruby has three turns to place six red squares. If she places them in the 2x2 area, she can occupy two of the four spots, preventing Blake from completing it.But Blake can choose the order. Suppose:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (1,1).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2).Turn 5: Blake places (0,1). But Ruby already blocked that.Alternatively, Turn 3: Blake places (0,2).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2).Turn 5: Blake places (2,0).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,0) and (2,1).Turn 7: Blake places (2,2).Now Blake has four squares: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). This is a larger square, but the interior is empty. The area would be zero because the interior isn&#39;t blue. So this isn&#39;t helpful.Alternatively, if Blake can create a solid 2x2 block, that&#39;s four squares. But Ruby can block two of them. Therefore, the maximum Blake can guarantee is two squares? But two squares don&#39;t form a polygon with area greater than 1 each.Wait, no. If two squares are adjacent, they form a 2x1 rectangle, which can be enclosed in a polygon of area 2. But since both squares are blue, the polygon would enclose both, so area 2. However, if the two squares are diagonal, the smallest polygon enclosing them would be a 2x2 square, but the interior would include two white or red squares, so the area would still be 2.Wait, but the problem states &quot;unit squares in the largest simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot; So the polygon must contain only blue squares. If two blue squares are diagonal, the polygon enclosing them would have to cover the two blue squares and exclude the two white squares in between. That&#39;s impossible because a simple polygon can&#39;t have holes. Therefore, the only way to enclose both blue squares is to have a polygon that includes the two blue squares and the two white squares in between. But since the white squares aren&#39;t blue, the polygon can&#39;t contain them. Therefore, two diagonal blue squares can&#39;t form a polygon of area 2; the maximum would be two separate polygons of area 1 each.Therefore, adjacent blue squares can form a polygon of area 2. So if Blake can place two adjacent blue squares without Ruby placing a red square between them, he can score 2. But Ruby places two red squares per turn. So if Blake places two adjacent squares over two turns, Ruby can block the second one.For example:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby places (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0).Turn 4: Ruby places (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1).Turn 6: Ruby places (1,-1) and (0,-2).Turn 7: Blake places (1,0). But it&#39;s already red.So Blake can&#39;t even get two adjacent squares if Ruby blocks them.Alternatively, Blake could place two squares not adjacent:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks two.Turn 3: Blake places (2,0)Turn 4: Ruby blocks two.Turn 5: Blake places (0,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks two.Turn 7: Blake places (2,2)Now, Blake has four isolated squares. The largest polygon is still area 1.This is getting frustrating. It seems like Ruby can always block Blake from forming any connected blue region larger than a single square. Therefore, the maximum score Blake can guarantee is 1.But that can&#39;t be right, because the problem is asking for the largest score Blake can guarantee, implying it&#39;s more than 1.Wait, perhaps I&#39;m missing something. Let&#39;s re-read the problem.&quot;The number of unit squares in the largest (in terms of area) simple polygon containing only blue unit squares.&quot;Ah, wait a second! Does &quot;containing only blue unit squares&quot; mean that the polygon must be such that every unit square inside the polygon is blue? Or does it mean that the polygon is made up of blue unit squares?If it&#39;s the former, then the entire area inside the polygon must be blue. If it&#39;s the latter, the polygon itself must be traced along blue squares. But the wording is ambiguous, but likely it&#39;s the former.Therefore, to have a polygon of area k, all k unit squares inside the polygon must be blue. Therefore, Blake needs to have a k-square region completely filled with blue, surrounded by a perimeter (which can be red or white), forming a simple polygon.But if that&#39;s the case, then the maximum score Blake can guarantee is 4, because he can create a 2x2 blue region before Ruby can block it.But how?Wait, here&#39;s a possible strategy:Blake focuses on creating a 2x2 block as quickly as possible. The 2x2 block requires four blue squares. Blake can try to place them in quick succession, but Ruby gets to place two red squares each turn.Suppose Blake&#39;s moves are:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 3: (0,1)Turn 5: (1,0)Turn 7: (1,1)But between each of Blake&#39;s turns, Ruby gets to place two red squares. So after Turn 1, Turn 2: Ruby can place (0,1) and (1,0). Then Turn 3: Blake wants to place (0,1), but it&#39;s already red. So he can&#39;t. Therefore, this strategy fails.Alternatively, Blake varies the order.Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (1,1)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2)Turn 5: Blake places (2,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,2) and (2,3)Turn 7: Blake places (3,3)This forms a diagonal line, not a 2x2 block.Alternatively, Blake scatters his blue squares in a 2x2 area but Ruby blocks the necessary ones.It seems impossible for Blake to place four blue squares in a 2x2 block without Ruby blocking at least one of them. Since Blake places one per turn and Ruby two, over four turns (to place four blues), Ruby has three turns to place six reds, which can cover three of the four required squares, leaving one. But Blake needs all four.Wait, maybe not. Suppose Blake places the first three squares of the 2x2 block, and Ruby can only block two per turn. So:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (0,1) and (1,0)Turn 3: Blake places (1,1)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (1,2) and (2,1)Turn 5: Blake places (2,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (2,3) and (3,2)Turn 7: Blake places (3,3)Still not a 2x2 block.Alternatively, Blake places:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 3: (0,2)Turn 5: (2,0)Turn 7: (2,2)This forms a larger square, but again, the interior is not blue.Wait, perhaps the answer is that Blake can only guarantee an area of 1, because Ruby can always block any attempt to create a larger connected region. But that seems too pessimistic.Alternatively, maybe Blake can create a &quot;donut&quot; shape, where he has a ring of blue squares enclosing a white area. But the problem requires the polygon to contain only blue squares, so the enclosed white area would not count. Therefore, the area would be the number of blue squares in the ring, which is linear in the perimeter.But to form a donut shape, Blake needs to create a loop of blue squares. The minimal loop is a 3x3 square with the center empty. But that requires 8 blue squares. During the time Blake is placing these 8, Ruby can place 14 red squares. She can place some inside the donut, but the donut&#39;s area is the blue squares in the ring, so maybe that&#39;s possible. But forming a loop without Ruby blocking it is challenging.Alternatively, Blake can create a spiral that eventually loops. Suppose he builds a spiral with one square per turn, and after several turns, he closes the loop. The area inside the spiral would be all the squares inside the loop. If Blake hasn&#39;t placed blue squares there, they could be white or red. But to have the area be all blue, Blake needs to fill the interior, which would take more turns.Alternatively, maybe Blake can use a strategy where he builds a convex region incrementally, always adding squares on the perimeter such that Ruby can&#39;t block all growth directions. For example, expanding in a hexagonal pattern where each new square adds two new growth directions. Since Ruby can only block two per turn, Blake can always have a new direction to expand.But I&#39;m not sure. This is quite complex.Wait, let&#39;s think of it in terms of Blake needing to enclose an area where all squares inside are blue. To do that, he must have placed blue squares in all those interior positions. Ruby can place red squares anywhere, so if she places a red square inside the area Blake intended to enclose, that area is ruined.Therefore, Blake&#39;s strategy must be to first fill the interior of a region with blue squares, then build the perimeter. But since he can only place one per turn, Ruby can see where the interior is being filled and place red squares there.Alternatively, Blake can reverse it: first build the perimeter, then fill the interior. But building the perimeter takes multiple turns, during which Ruby can place red squares inside.For example, if Blake wants to build a 3x3 square:1. Build the perimeter: 8 squares.2. Fill the interior: 1 square.But during the 8 turns to build the perimeter, Ruby can place 14 red squares, likely filling the interior.Therefore, this approach won&#39;t work.Alternatively, build a smaller shape, like a 1x2 rectangle. Area 2. Blake needs two adjacent squares. If he can place them before Ruby blocks.Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (0,1). Blocked.Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (0,-2).Turn 7: Blake places (1,0). Blocked.It seems impossible.But wait, maybe Blake can place two squares in a non-adjacent way that still allows a polygon of area 2. For example, two squares diagonally adjacent. The smallest polygon enclosing them would have an area of 2, but only if the two squares are considered. However, as I thought earlier, enclosing two diagonal squares would require including the squares between them, which are not blue. Therefore, the area cannot be 2.Thus, the only way to have an area of 2 is to have two adjacent blue squares. But as shown, Ruby can block this.Therefore, is the maximum score Blake can guarantee 1? That seems unlikely, but perhaps.Wait, let&#39;s consider that when Blake ends the game, he can choose any simple polygon containing only blue squares. If he has multiple blue squares, even disconnected, he can choose the largest cluster. But if all blue squares are isolated, the maximum area is 1.But if Blake can create two adjacent blue squares, the area is 2. But can he guarantee that?Suppose Blake&#39;s strategy is to always place a square adjacent to his previous one. Ruby can block one direction, but Blake can snake around.Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1)Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (0,-2)Turn 7: Blake places (1,0). Blocked.Alternatively, Turn 7: Blake places (-1,-1)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (-2,-1) and (-1,-2)Turn 9: Blake places (-2,0). Blocked.This isn&#39;t working.Alternatively, Blake can place squares in a knight&#39;s move pattern to avoid Ruby&#39;s blocks.Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (2,1)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (3,1) and (2,2)Turn 5: Blake places (1,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,3) and (2,2) [already blocked]Turn 7: Blake places (0,2)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2)Turn 9: Blake places (-1,1)This forms a disconnected pattern, but no two blue squares are adjacent. Therefore, largest area is 1.It seems no matter what Blake does, Ruby can always block adjacent placements. Therefore, Blake cannot guarantee any area larger than 1. But the problem says &quot;the largest score Blake can guarantee&quot;. If the answer is 1, that seems too trivial, but maybe that&#39;s the case.However, I recall in some similar games, like the classic blocko game, the first player can always secure a certain area. Maybe there&#39;s a way for Blake to create a 2x2 area even with Ruby&#39;s blocking.Wait, another approach: use the fact that the grid is infinite and Blake can start building in a remote area where Ruby hasn&#39;t placed any red squares.For example, Blake can start at (0,0). Ruby blocks nearby. Then Blake starts building at (100,100). Ruby has to travel there to block, but since the grid is infinite, Blake can keep jumping to new areas faster than Ruby can block.But since Blake needs a single polygon containing only blue squares, he can&#39;t just have scattered blue squares. He needs a connected region. So if he jumps to a new area, he abandons the previous one.But if he keeps jumping, Ruby has to spread her red squares all over the grid, thinning her blocking ability. Then, once Ruby&#39;s red squares are spread out, Blake can focus on a specific area and build a cluster there before Ruby can concentrate her blocks.However, since Ruby can choose where to place her red squares, she can always respond to Blake&#39;s current cluster. So if Blake moves to a new area, Ruby can start blocking there.Alternatively, Blake can work on two separate clusters. While Ruby is blocking one, Blake can build the other.For example:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (100,100)Turn 4: Ruby has to choose between blocking around (0,0) or (100,100). She might split her blocks.Turn 5: Blake places (100,101)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (100,102) and (101,101)Turn 7: Blake places (100,99)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (100,98) and (101,99)Turn 9: Blake places (99,100)Turn 10: Ruby blocks (98,100) and (99,101)Turn 11: Blake places (99,99)Now, in the area around (100,100), Blake has several blue squares, but they are not connected. To form a polygon, they need to be connected. But since each placement is isolated, the largest polygon is still 1.Alternatively, if Blake focuses on one cluster:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks adjacent squares.Turn 3: Blake places (0,2)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2)Turn 5: Blake places (2,0)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,0) and (2,1)Turn 7: Blake places (2,2)Now, Blake has four blue squares at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). Still not forming a connected region.This is really challenging. Maybe the answer is that Blake can guarantee an area of 4 by using a strategy where he builds a 2x2 block in a way that Ruby can&#39;t block all four squares.Wait, here&#39;s a possible sequence:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (1,1)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2)Turn 5: Blake places (0,1). But it&#39;s blocked.Turn 5: Blake places (2,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,2) and (2,3)Turn 7: Blake places (3,3)This still doesn&#39;t form a 2x2.Alternatively, Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1)Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (0,-2)Turn 7: Blake places (1,1)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2)Turn 9: Blake places (1,-1). Blocked.No luck.Perhaps there&#39;s a different approach. Since Blake can choose when to end the game, he doesn&#39;t have to keep playing indefinitely. He can wait for the right moment when he has a certain configuration.Suppose Blake&#39;s strategy is to create four blue squares in a 2x2 block by placing them in the four corners first, then filling in the center. But Ruby can block the center.Alternatively, Blake can create a cross shape, then convert it into a 3x3 square. But again, Ruby blocks.Wait, here&#39;s a different idea inspired from graph connectivity. To form a simply connected polygon, Blake needs to have a region where all squares are blue and the perimeter is closed. The minimal number of squares to form a closed loop is 4, forming a 2x2 square. But as we saw, Ruby can block this.However, if Blake can create a &quot;bridge&quot; between two separate blue squares, forming a loop. For example:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: (2,0)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (3,0) and (2,1)Turn 5: (0,2)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2)Turn 7: (2,2)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (3,2) and (2,3)Turn 9: (1,1)If Blake places (1,1) on Turn 9, connecting (0,0), (2,0), (0,2), (2,2) through the center. But this would form a loop only if the perimeter is closed. However, the center square (1,1) connects diagonally, which doesn&#39;t form a closed polygon. A polygon needs to be a closed loop with edges connected orthogonally.Therefore, even with (1,1) colored blue, the loop isn&#39;t closed.This is really tough. I might need to concede that the maximum Blake can guarantee is 1, but that feels wrong. There has to be a way.Wait, let&#39;s think outside the box. What if Blake doesn&#39;t try to build a connected region but instead places blue squares in such a way that they form the vertices of a large polygon, with the interior automatically being blue because Ruby didn&#39;t have time to place red squares there.For example, Blake places four blue squares in the corners of a large square. The interior is all white, but if Blake can enclose a large area with four blue squares at the corners, the interior would be white, but maybe he can claim that area as his score. But no, the problem states the polygon must contain only blue unit squares. So the entire interior must be blue. Therefore, this approach won&#39;t work.Another thought: if Blake can create a chain of blue squares that loops around a region, and then fill the interior quickly before Ruby can react. But with Blake placing one per turn and Ruby two, filling the interior would take too long.Alternatively, use the fact that a polygon can have holes. But the problem specifies a simple polygon, which cannot have holes.Wait, simple polygon is a polygon without holes and without self-intersections. So Blake needs a single, non-intersecting loop enclosing only blue squares.If Blake can create such a loop, even if it&#39;s large, with all the interior blue, he can score big. But creating the loop and filling the interior seems impossible with Ruby&#39;s interference.But perhaps if the loop is large enough, Ruby can&#39;t block all the interior squares. For example, if Blake creates a loop with perimeter N, the interior has roughly N² area. But filling that interior would take N² turns, during which Ruby places 2N² red squares. So she can fill the entire interior.But if Blake creates the perimeter and claims the score before Ruby fills the interior, but the problem states the score is the number of unit squares in the largest polygon containing only blue squares. So if the interior is white, it doesn&#39;t count. The polygon must contain only blue squares. Therefore, the loop itself is the polygon, with area equal to the number of blue squares on the perimeter. But a loop has a perimeter of N, area zero. Wait, no. The area of a polygon is the number of unit squares inside it, not the length of the perimeter.Therefore, even if Blake creates a large loop, the area inside would be white or red, so the score would be zero unless the interior is blue.Therefore, Blake needs both the perimeter and the interior to be blue. Which seems impossible unless he fills the interior first, which would take too many turns.Given all this, I think the answer must be that Blake can guarantee a score of 4. Here&#39;s the reasoning:Blake can focus on building a 2x2 square. Although Ruby can block three of the four squares, Blake can place the fourth square in a way that Ruby cannot block all. For example:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (1,1).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2).Turn 5: Blake places (2,2).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,2) and (2,3).Turn 7: Blake places (3,3).This doesn&#39;t form a 2x2. Alternatively, maybe Blake uses a different formation.Alternatively, Blake can mirror Ruby&#39;s blocks. For every red square Ruby places, Blake moves in the opposite direction. But this is vague.Wait, here&#39;s a different approach inspired by parallel universes. Blake can create multiple potential 2x2 squares in different parts of the grid. Each turn, he works on a different one. Ruby can only block two per turn, so if Blake has three potential 2x2 squares, Ruby can&#39;t block all of them. Eventually, Blake can complete one.For example:Turn 1: Blake starts building 2x2 at (0,0): places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake starts building 2x2 at (10,10): places (10,10).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (11,10) and (10,11).Turn 5: Blake starts building 2x2 at (20,20): places (20,20).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (21,20) and (20,21).Turn 7: Blake goes back to (0,0) and places (1,1).Turn 8: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2).Turn 9: Blake goes to (10,10) and places (11,11).Turn 10: Ruby blocks (12,11) and (11,12).Turn 11: Blake goes to (20,20) and places (21,21).Turn 12: Ruby blocks (22,21) and (21,22).Turn 13: Blake places (0,1). Blocked.Turn 13: Blake places (0,2).Turn 14: Ruby blocks (0,3) and (1,2).Turn 15: Blake places (2,0).Turn 16: Ruby blocks (3,0) and (2,1).Turn 17: Blake places (2,2).Now, at (0,0), Blake has (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). Not a 2x2.This isn&#39;t working. Maybe this approach is too scattered.Alternatively, Blake can focus on one 2x2 area but place the squares in an order that Ruby can&#39;t block all.For example:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (1,1).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (2,1) and (1,2).Turn 5: Blake places (0,1). Blocked.Turn 5: Blake places (2,2).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (3,2) and (2,3).Turn 7: Blake places (3,3).Still no 2x2.I think I&#39;m stuck here. Given that Ruby can place two squares each turn, and Blake only one, it&#39;s impossible for Blake to place four squares in a 2x2 block without Ruby blocking at least one. Therefore, the maximum Blake can guarantee is 1.But that feels incorrect because the problem is asking for the largest score, implying it&#39;s more than 1. Maybe the answer is 4, but I can&#39;t see how.Wait, here&#39;s a different idea. If Blake can create a chain of blue squares that forms a loop enclosing an area, even if the interior is not filled, but the loop itself is made of blue squares. Then, the polygon can be the loop, and the area inside is zero. But the problem states the score is the number of unit squares in the polygon. If the polygon is just the perimeter, the area would be the number of blue squares on the perimeter. But that&#39;s not the case. The area is the number of unit squares inside the polygon, which must all be blue.Therefore, even if Blake forms a loop of blue squares, if the interior is not blue, the area is zero. Therefore, the key is filling the interior.But how?Wait, if Blake creates a 1x1 square, the area is 1. If he creates a 2x1 rectangle, the area is 2. But to create a 2x1 rectangle, he needs two adjacent blue squares. Can he guarantee that?Let&#39;s see:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (0,1). Blocked.Turn 3: Blake places (-1,0).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (-2,0) and (-1,1).Turn 5: Blake places (0,-1).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (1,-1) and (0,-2).Turn 7: Blake places (1,0). Blocked.No, he can&#39;t.But if Blake is allowed to place anywhere, maybe he can place a square far away where Ruby hasn&#39;t blocked.Turn 1: Blake places (0,0).Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1).Turn 3: Blake places (100,100).Turn 4: Ruby blocks (101,100) and (100,101).Turn 5: Blake places (100,101). Blocked.Turn 5: Blake places (99,100).Turn 6: Ruby blocks (98,100) and (99,101).Turn 7: Blake places (99,99).Turn 8: Ruby blocks (98,99) and (99,98).Turn 9: Blake places (100,99).Now, in this remote area, Blake has (100,100), (99,100), (99,99), (100,99). This forms a 2x2 block! Wait, no. These four squares form a 2x2 block only if they are at the corners. Wait, (100,100), (100,99), (99,99), (99,100) do form a 2x2 block. But let&#39;s check the timeline:Turn 1: (0,0)Turn 3: (100,100)Turn 5: (99,100)Turn 7: (99,99)Turn 9: (100,99)So after Turn 9, Blake has four squares: (100,100), (99,100), (99,99), (100,99). These form a 2x2 block with the center at (99.5, 99.5). Wait, no. Those four squares are arranged in a square, each adjacent to two others. So they form a 2x2 block. The coordinates are:(99,99), (99,100), (100,99), (100,100)Yes, this is a 2x2 block. The key is, Blake placed these four squares over Turns 3, 5, 7, 9. Between these turns, Ruby placed red squares around the area, but she didn&#39;t block all four.Wait, let&#39;s detail the turns:Turn 1: Blake places (0,0)Turn 2: Ruby blocks (1,0) and (0,1)Turn 3: Blake places (100,100)Turn 4: Ruby blocks (101,100) and (100,101)Turn 5: Blake places (99,100)Turn 6: Ruby blocks (98,100) and (99,101)Turn 7: Blake places (99,99)Turn 8: Ruby blocks (98,99) and (99,98)Turn 9: Blake places (100,99)So after Turn 9, Blake has placed four squares at (100,100), (99,100), (99,99), (100,99). These form a 2x2 block. Ruby placed red squares at (101,100), (100,101), (98,100), (99,101), (98,99), (99,98). None of these are inside the 2x2 block Blake created. Therefore, the 2x2 block is intact with all four blue squares. Therefore, the area is 4.So Blake can guarantee a score of 4 by placing four squares in a remote 2x2 block, using Turns 3,5,7,9, while Ruby is busy blocking around the previous placements. Since the grid is infinite, Blake can always find a remote location to build a 2x2 block without Ruby blocking all four squares.Therefore, the answer is 4.Final Answerboxed{4}&lt;/think&gt;Blake and Ruby are playing a game on an infinite grid where Blake colors squares blue and Ruby colors squares red. Blake&#39;s goal is to maximize the score, which is the area of the largest simple polygon containing only blue squares. Ruby colors two squares red for each turn Blake takes. Blake needs a strategy to ensure he can form a large polygon despite Ruby&#39;s interference.Key considerations:1. Simple Polygon: A closed, non-intersecting shape where all interior squares must be blue.2. Turn Ratio: Blake places 1 square per turn, Ruby places 2 squares per turn.3. Infinite Grid: Blake can exploit the grid&#39;s infiniteness to avoid Ruby&#39;s blocks.After analyzing various strategies, it is determined that Blake can guarantee a score of 4 by forming a 2x2 block of blue squares in a remote area. By spreading his moves across different regions of the grid, Blake can place four squares in a 2x2 configuration before Ruby can block all necessary squares. This strategy leverages the grid&#39;s infiniteness to avoid concentrated blocking from Ruby.

We simply let Blake start with any cell blue, then always draw adjacent to a previously drawn blue cell until this is no longer possible.Note that for n leq 3, any connected region of n blue cells has more than 2 n liberties (non-blue cells adjacent to a blue cell); up to translation, rotation, and reflection, all the cases are shown in the figure below with liberties being denoted by circles.So as long as n leq 3, it&#39;s impossible that Ruby has blocked every liberty, since Ruby has colored exactly 2 n cells red. Therefore, this algorithm could only terminate once n geq 4.Algorithm for Ruby to prevent more than 4 squares. Divide the entire grid into 2 times 2 squares, which we call windows. Any time Blake makes a move in a cell c, let Ruby mark any orthogonal neighbors of c in its window; then place any leftover red cells arbitrarily.Claim - It&#39;s impossible for any window to contain two orthogonally adjacent blue cells.Proof. By construction: if there were somehow two adjacent blue cells in the same window, whichever one was played first should have caused red cells to be added.We show this gives the upper bound of 4 squares. Consider a blue cell w, and assume WLOG it is in the southeast corner of a window. Label squares x, y, z as shown below.Note that by construction, the blue polygon cannot leave the square {w, x, y, z}, since whenever one of these four cells is blue, its neighbours outside that square are guaranteed to be red. This implies the bound.Remark (For Tetris fans). Here is a comedic alternative finish after proving the claim. Consider the possible tetrominoes (using the notation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Tetromino#One-sided_tetrominoes). We claim that only the square (0) is obtainable; as- T, J/L, and I all have three cells in a row, so they can&#39;t occur;- S and mathrm{Z} can&#39;t occur either; if the bottom row of an mathrm{S} crossed a window boundary, then the top row doesn&#39;t for example.Moreover, the only way a blue 0 could be obtained is if each of it cells is in a different window. In that case, no additional blue cells can be added: it&#39;s fully surrounded by red.Finally, for any k-omino with k&gt;4, one can find a tetromino as a subset. (Proof: take the orthogonal adjacency graph of the k-omino, choose a spanning tree, and delete leaves from the tree until there are only four vertices left.)Remark (Common wrong approach). Suppose Ruby employs the following algorithm whenever Blake places a square x. If either the north and west neighbors of x are unoccupied, place red squares on both of them. With any leftover red squares, place them at other neighbors of x if possible. Finally, place any other red squares arbitrarily. (Another variant, the one Evan originally came up with, is to place east if possible when west is occupied, place south if possible when north is occupied, and then place any remaining red squares arbitrarily.)As written, this strategy does not work. The reason is that one can end up in the following situation (imagine the blue square in the center is played first; moves for Ruby are drawn as red X&#39;s):In order to prevent Blake from winning, Ruby would need to begin playing moves not adjacent to Blake&#39;s most recent move.Thus in order for this solution to be made correct, one needs a careful algorithm for how Ruby should play when the north and west neighbors are not available. As far as I am aware, there are some specifications that work (and some that don&#39;t), but every working algorithm I have seen seems to involve some amount of casework.It is even more difficult to come up with a solution involving playing on just &quot;some&quot; two neighbors of recently added blue squares without the &quot;prefer north and west&quot; idea.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-1974eff5><span data-v-1974eff5>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
