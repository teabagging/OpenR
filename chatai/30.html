Let me think step by step.First, the problem states that we have a triangle with sides a, b, c, and squares are constructed outwardly on each of these sides. The areas of these squares are S_a, S_b, and S_c respectively. We need to find the minimum value of S_a + S_b + S_c when the perimeter a + b + c = 18.Alright, let&#39;s start by recalling that the area of a square is equal to the square of its side length. So, S_a would be a², S_b is b², and S_c is c². Therefore, the sum we need to minimize is a² + b² + c², given that a + b + c = 18, and a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. So, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities as well: each side must be less than the sum of the other two.But wait, before jumping into the optimization, I need to confirm: is S_a, S_b, S_c indeed the areas of the squares on sides a, b, c? The problem says &quot;construct squares outward on each side, with areas sequentially S_a, S_b, S_c&quot;. So, yes, each square&#39;s area corresponds to the square of the side length. So S_a = a², S_b = b², S_c = c². So, the total sum is a² + b² + c². So, the problem reduces to minimizing a² + b² + c² given that a + b + c = 18 and a, b, c satisfy the triangle inequalities.Okay, so how do we minimize a² + b² + c² with a fixed perimeter? This seems like a problem that can be approached using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since the problem mentions a triangle, we also need to consider the triangle inequalities. However, maybe the minimum occurs when the triangle is equilateral? Let&#39;s check.If the triangle is equilateral, then all sides are equal: a = b = c = 18/3 = 6. Then, each square area would be 6² = 36, so the total sum would be 3*36 = 108. But is this the minimum?Wait, but maybe not. For example, in some optimization problems with sums and products, the extremum is achieved when variables are equal, but sometimes when variables are as equal as possible. But here, perhaps the minimal value is achieved when the triangle is equilateral. Let&#39;s verify.Alternatively, if we don&#39;t consider the triangle inequalities, the minimal value of a² + b² + c² given a + b + c = 18 would occur when a = b = c, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the QM-AM inequality. Because QM is always greater than or equal to AM. The quadratic mean of a, b, c is sqrt((a² + b² + c²)/3), and the arithmetic mean is (a + b + c)/3 = 6. So, sqrt((a² + b² + c²)/3) &gt;= 6, so (a² + b² + c²)/3 &gt;= 36, so a² + b² + c² &gt;= 108. Equality holds when a = b = c. So, if we ignore the triangle inequalities, the minimum is 108 when all sides are equal. But in our case, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities. However, if the triangle is equilateral, then the triangle inequalities are certainly satisfied. So, even when considering the triangle inequalities, the minimum is still 108. Therefore, the minimal value of S_a + S_b + S_c is 108.Wait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Suppose we have a degenerate triangle, where one side is almost equal to the sum of the other two. For example, let’s say a approaches b + c. Then, a would be close to 18 - a, so 2a ≈ 18, so a ≈ 9. Then, b + c ≈ 9. Suppose we take a = 9, b = 9 - ε, c = ε, where ε is very small. Then, the sum of the squares would be 81 + (81 - 18ε + ε²) + ε² ≈ 81 + 81 = 162 when ε approaches 0. That&#39;s way bigger than 108. So, in this case, the sum of squares is much larger. On the other hand, if we take an isoceles triangle, say a = b, and c different. Let’s see: For example, let a = b = 7, c = 4. Then, a + b + c = 18. The sum of squares would be 49 + 49 + 16 = 114, which is more than 108. If we take a = 6, b = 6, c = 6, sum is 108. If we take a different triangle, like a = 5, b = 5, c = 8. Then, sum of squares is 25 + 25 + 64 = 114 again. Hmm. So, indeed, when the triangle is equilateral, we get the minimal sum. So, perhaps the answer is 108.But wait, maybe there&#39;s a non-equilateral triangle where the sum is smaller? Let me check. Suppose we take a = 7, b = 6, c = 5. Then, perimeter is 18. The sum of squares is 49 + 36 + 25 = 110, which is more than 108. If we take a more skewed triangle but still not degenerate. Let&#39;s take a = 8, b = 5, c = 5. Perimeter 18. Sum of squares is 64 + 25 + 25 = 114. Still higher. If we take a = 7.5, b = 5.25, c = 5.25. Sum of squares is 56.25 + 27.5625 + 27.5625 = 111.375. Still higher than 108. So, seems like the minimal is indeed when the triangle is equilateral.But wait, let&#39;s use Lagrange multipliers to confirm. Let&#39;s set up the optimization problem: minimize f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c², subject to the constraint g(a, b, c) = a + b + c - 18 = 0, and the triangle inequalities: a + b &gt; c, a + c &gt; b, b + c &gt; a. But perhaps since we found that the minimal without considering triangle inequalities is 108, which corresponds to a triangle that is equilateral and satisfies all triangle inequalities, then the minimum is indeed 108.Alternatively, suppose that even if the minimal without constraints is feasible (i.e., satisfies the triangle inequalities), then it is the constrained minimum. Since the equilateral triangle satisfies all triangle inequalities, then the answer is 108.Therefore, the minimal value of S_a + S_b + S_c is 108.Wait, but let me check another approach. If we use the formula that relates the sum of squares to the perimeter and the variances. We know that:(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)So, 18² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)So, 324 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)We need to minimize a² + b² + c². Since ab + bc + ca is involved here, and we can relate it to other terms. Alternatively, for fixed perimeter, the sum a² + b² + c² is minimized when ab + bc + ca is maximized. So, how do we maximize ab + bc + ca given a + b + c = 18?Wait, but for three variables with a fixed sum, the product ab + bc + ca is maximized when the variables are equal. Let me recall that. For example, by the AM-GM inequality, for non-negative real numbers, the sum ab + bc + ca is maximized when a = b = c. Let&#39;s check.If a = b = c = 6, then ab + bc + ca = 3*6*6 = 108.If a = 7, b = 6, c = 5, then ab + bc + ca = 7*6 + 6*5 + 5*7 = 42 + 30 + 35 = 107, which is less than 108.If a = 8, b = 5, c = 5, then ab + bc + ca = 8*5 + 5*5 + 5*8 = 40 + 25 + 40 = 105, which is also less.So, indeed, ab + bc + ca is maximized when a = b = c. Therefore, the maximum of ab + bc + ca is 108, achieved at a = b = c = 6. Hence, substituting back into the equation:324 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)Thus, when ab + bc + ca is maximized, then a² + b² + c² is minimized. Since ab + bc + ca maximum is 108, then:324 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2*108 =&gt; 324 = (a² + b² + c²) + 216 =&gt; a² + b² + c² = 108. Therefore, the minimal value of a² + b² + c² is indeed 108, achieved when a = b = c = 6. So, the minimal sum of the areas of the squares is 108.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{108}.Final Answerboxed{108}&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with sides ( a, b, c ) and a perimeter of 18, we need to find the minimum value of the sum of the areas of squares constructed on each side, denoted as ( S_a, S_b, S_c ).1. Understanding the Problem:   - The areas of the squares are ( S_a = a^2 ), ( S_b = b^2 ), and ( S_c = c^2 ).   - We need to minimize ( S_a + S_b + S_c = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) given ( a + b + c = 18 ).2. Using Mathematical Inequalities:   - By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Quadratic Mean-Arithmetic Mean (QM-AM) inequality, the minimum value of ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) occurs when ( a = b = c ).   - For a fixed perimeter, the quadratic mean is minimized when all sides are equal.3. Checking the Equilateral Triangle Case:   - If the triangle is equilateral, each side ( a = b = c = frac{18}{3} = 6 ).   - The area of each square is ( 6^2 = 36 ), so the total sum is ( 3 times 36 = 108 ).4. Verification with Lagrange Multipliers and Triangle Inequalities:   - Using the identity ( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ), we substitute ( a + b + c = 18 ):     [     324 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)     ]   - Maximizing ( ab + bc + ca ) (which occurs when ( a = b = c )) leads to minimizing ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ).5. Conclusion:   - The minimum value of ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) is achieved when the triangle is equilateral, leading to the minimum sum of the areas of the squares being ( 108 ).Thus, the minimum value of ( S_a + S_b + S_c ) is (boxed{108}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the minimum value of the sum of the areas of squares constructed on each side of triangle ABC, given that the perimeter of the triangle is 18. The sides are a, b, c, and the areas of the squares are S_a, S_b, S_c. So, the problem is to minimize S_a + S_b + S_c, where each S is the square of the respective side. Wait, since the area of a square is side length squared, that means S_a = a², S_b = b², S_c = c². So actually, the problem simplifies to minimizing a² + b² + c² given that a + b + c = 18, and a, b, c are the sides of a triangle. But hold on, a, b, c must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, each side has to be less than the sum of the other two. So, for example, a &lt; b + c, b &lt; a + c, c &lt; a + b. That&#39;s an important constraint. If we ignore the triangle inequality, the problem would be just minimizing the sum of squares given the perimeter, which is a standard optimization problem. But since we have triangle inequalities, maybe the minimal value occurs when the triangle is equilateral? Because in symmetric problems, often the extremum occurs at the symmetric case. Let&#39;s check.If the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal: a = b = c = 18/3 = 6. Then, each square area is 6² = 36, so the total is 3*36 = 108. Is this the minimal value?Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a configuration where the sum of squares is smaller. Let&#39;s think. In general, for fixed perimeter, the sum of squares is minimized when all variables are equal. That comes from the inequality that the square function is convex, so by Jensen&#39;s inequality, the minimum occurs at the mean. But that&#39;s under the condition that the variables can vary freely. However, here the variables must satisfy the triangle inequalities. So, the question is: is the equilateral triangle the configuration that minimizes the sum of the squares of the sides, given the perimeter is fixed?Alternatively, maybe a degenerate triangle would give a lower sum? Wait, but a degenerate triangle has one side equal to the sum of the other two. For example, let&#39;s say c = a + b. Then the perimeter is a + b + c = 2(a + b) = 18 ⇒ a + b = 9, and c = 9. Then, the sum of squares would be a² + b² + 81. To minimize a² + b² with a + b = 9. The minimum occurs when a = b = 4.5, so the sum would be 4.5² + 4.5² + 9² = 20.25 + 20.25 + 81 = 121.5. Which is higher than 108. So, in this case, even the degenerate triangle gives a higher sum. Therefore, maybe the minimal sum occurs at the equilateral triangle.Alternatively, perhaps another triangle, not equilateral and not degenerate, could give a lower sum. Let&#39;s consider an isoceles triangle. Let’s suppose a = b, then c = 18 - 2a. Then, the sum of squares would be 2a² + (18 - 2a)². Let&#39;s compute this as a function of a. Let f(a) = 2a² + (18 - 2a)². Expanding this: 2a² + (324 - 72a + 4a²) = 6a² -72a + 324. To find the minimum, take derivative: f’(a) = 12a -72. Setting to zero: 12a -72 = 0 ⇒ a = 6. So, a = 6, then c = 18 - 12 = 6. So, again the equilateral triangle. Therefore, in the case of isoceles triangles, the minimum is achieved at the equilateral triangle.Alternatively, suppose we take a scalene triangle. Let’s say sides a, b, c are different. How can we approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers. The problem is to minimize S = a² + b² + c² subject to the constraint a + b + c = 18 and the triangle inequalities: a + b &gt; c, a + c &gt; b, b + c &gt; a. Let&#39;s set up the Lagrangian. However, with inequalities, it&#39;s more complicated, but perhaps the minimum occurs in the interior of the domain defined by the triangle inequalities, which would mean that the Lagrangian method with only the perimeter constraint would suffice. If the minimum from the unconstrained problem (i.e., just perimeter constraint) satisfies the triangle inequalities, then that is the minimum. Otherwise, the minimum would lie on the boundary of the domain.But in the unconstrained problem (without considering triangle inequalities), the minimum of a² + b² + c² with a + b + c = 18 occurs at a = b = c = 6, which gives the equilateral triangle, which does satisfy the triangle inequalities. Therefore, the minimal value is 108. Therefore, the answer should be 108.But let me verify once more. Suppose that we have a triangle with sides 6, 6, 6. The sum of squares is 3*(6^2) = 108. If we take another triangle, say 5, 5, 8. Perimeter is 18. Sum of squares is 25 + 25 + 64 = 114, which is higher. If we take 7, 7, 4. Sum is 49 + 49 + 16 = 114. Still higher. What about a scalene triangle, say 5, 6, 7. Perimeter is 18. Sum of squares is 25 + 36 + 49 = 110, which is higher than 108. Hmm, so even 110. What if we take a more skewed triangle but not degenerate? Let&#39;s try 6, 5.5, 6.5. Perimeter is 18. Sum of squares: 36 + 30.25 + 42.25 = 108.5. Still higher than 108. If we take a triangle approaching equilateral, like 5.9, 6, 6.1. Sum of squares: (5.9)^2 + 36 + (6.1)^2. Let&#39;s compute: 34.81 + 36 + 37.21 = 108.02. Very close to 108, but still slightly higher. So, seems like 108 is indeed the minimum.But to confirm, let&#39;s use the formula that relates the sum of squares of the sides to the perimeter and the variance. We have a + b + c = 18. Let’s denote the average as 6. Then, sum of squares is minimized when each side is equal to the average. Any deviation from the average would increase the sum of squares. Since in the case of a triangle, the sides can be equal (equilateral), which is allowed, then that gives the minimal sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is 108.Alternatively, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. For any real numbers, (a² + b² + c²)(1 + 1 + 1) ≥ (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, a² + b² + c² ≥ (18)^2 / 3 = 108. Equality holds when a = b = c = 6. Since the triangle can be equilateral, the inequality is tight, and thus the minimal sum is indeed 108. Therefore, the answer is 108.Final Answerboxed{108}&lt;/think&gt;Given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with sides ( a, b, c ) and a perimeter ( a + b + c = 18 ), we need to find the minimum value of the sum of the areas of squares constructed on each side, denoted as ( S_a + S_b + S_c ).The areas of the squares are ( S_a = a^2 ), ( S_b = b^2 ), and ( S_c = c^2 ). Therefore, we need to minimize ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) given the constraints ( a + b + c = 18 ) and the triangle inequalities.Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that for any real numbers ( a, b, c ):[(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(1 + 1 + 1) geq (a + b + c)^2]Substituting ( a + b + c = 18 ), we get:[(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) geq frac{(18)^2}{3} = frac{324}{3} = 108]Equality holds when ( a = b = c ). Since an equilateral triangle with sides ( a = b = c = 6 ) satisfies both the perimeter constraint and the triangle inequalities, the minimum value of ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) is indeed 108.Thus, the minimum value of ( S_a + S_b + S_c ) is (boxed{108}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ceb94754></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ceb94754><span class="icon" data-v-ceb94754>🔑:</span>Given (a-b)^{2}+(b-c)^{2}+(c-a)^{2} geqslant 0, which means 2left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}right)=2(a b+b c+c a).

Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what exactly is being asked here. First off, a regular k-gon means all sides and angles are equal. Since it&#39;s inscribed in a circle of radius 1, all the vertices lie on the circumference of this circle. The problem is asking for the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals. So that includes every possible line segment connecting two vertices, right? Not just the sides but all the diagonals as well. Let me recall that in a regular polygon with k sides, the number of sides (which are also the number of edges) is k, and the number of diagonals is given by k(k - 3)/2. So total number of line segments (sides + diagonals) would be k + k(k - 3)/2 = k(k - 1)/2. That makes sense because that&#39;s the combination formula C(k, 2), which counts all possible pairs of vertices. So indeed, each side and diagonal corresponds to a unique pair of vertices. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the sum over all pairs of vertices of the square of the distance between them. Since all vertices lie on a unit circle, the distance between any two vertices can be found using the chord length formula. For a circle of radius r, the chord length between two points separated by an angle θ is 2r sin(θ/2). Here, the radius r is 1, so the chord length is 2 sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle between the two points. In a regular k-gon, the central angles between adjacent vertices are 2π/k radians. Therefore, the central angles between any two vertices will be multiples of 2π/k. Specifically, for two vertices separated by m edges (where m = 1, 2, ..., k - 1), the central angle is 2πm/k. However, since the polygon is regular and symmetric, the chord lengths depend only on the minimal number of edges between the two vertices. For example, in a pentagon, the chord connecting vertices 1 and 3 is the same as connecting 1 and k - 2 (if k=5, then 1 and 4, but since it&#39;s a regular polygon, these chords are congruent). Wait, actually, in a regular polygon, the chord length only depends on the minimal step between the vertices. So for each m from 1 to floor(k/2), there are k chords of that length. Wait, is that correct?Let me think. For a regular k-gon, each chord corresponding to m steps (where m = 1, 2, ..., floor(k/2)) is congruent. But for m and k - m, the chord lengths are the same because stepping m in one direction is equivalent to stepping k - m in the other direction. However, sin(θ/2) is symmetric around π, so sin((2πm/k)/2) = sin(πm/k) and sin((2π(k - m)/k)/2) = sin(π(k - m)/k) = sin(π - πm/k) = sin(πm/k). So indeed, chords for m and k - m steps have the same length. Therefore, the distinct chord lengths occur for m = 1 to m = floor(k/2). But when k is even, m = k/2 would correspond to the diameter, which is a unique case. But in terms of counting the number of chords for each m: For each m from 1 to k - 1, there are k chords, but chords for m and k - m are the same. Therefore, the number of distinct chord lengths is floor(k/2). However, when counting the total number of chords (which is k(k - 1)/2), each chord is counted twice for m and k - m except when k is even and m = k/2. Wait, perhaps not. Actually, for each m from 1 to k - 1, the number of chords corresponding to step m is exactly k, but when you consider that stepping m forward or backward gives the same set of chords. Wait, no. Wait, in a regular polygon, each chord is uniquely determined by its step m, where m is from 1 to floor(k/2). For example, in a pentagon (k=5), m=1 and m=4 give the same chord length, but since m=4 is equivalent to m=1 in the opposite direction, but actually, in a pentagon, stepping 1 or 4 gives different chords, but they have the same length. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in a pentagon, stepping 1 gives a side, stepping 2 gives a diagonal. Similarly, stepping 3 would be equivalent to stepping 2 in the other direction, stepping 4 is equivalent to stepping 1 in the other direction. So in general, for each m from 1 to floor(k/2), there are k chords of that length. However, when k is even, m = k/2 gives chords that are diameters, and there are k/2 such diameters. Wait, no. Wait, if k is even, then stepping m = k/2 from each vertex gives a diameter, but each diameter is shared by two vertices, so the number of diameters is k/2. Similarly, for other m&#39;s, when m &lt; k/2, the number of chords is k. Wait, maybe let&#39;s take an example. For k=5 (a pentagon), the chords can be steps of 1, 2, 3, 4. But stepping 1 and 4 are equivalent in terms of chord length. Similarly, stepping 2 and 3. So chord lengths for m=1 and m=4 are the same, but there are 5 chords for each. Wait, but in a pentagon, each vertex is connected to two others via diagonals. Wait, no. Each vertex is connected to 4 others (since in a pentagon, each vertex connects to two adjacent vertices via sides and two non-adjacent via diagonals). Wait, but the total number of sides and diagonals is C(5,2)=10. So sides are 5, diagonals are 5. Each diagonal in a pentagon is of the same length? No, wait, in a regular pentagon, all diagonals are of equal length. Wait, is that true? Wait, actually, in a regular pentagon, all the diagonals (the chords connecting non-adjacent vertices) are of equal length. So for m=2, stepping two vertices apart, gives the diagonal, and since there are 5 vertices, each vertex has two diagonals, so total diagonals are 5*2/2=5. So all diagonals have the same length. So in this case, chord lengths for m=1 (sides) and m=2 (diagonals). So chord lengths are different for m=1 and m=2, each occurring 5 times. But in a regular hexagon (k=6), stepping m=1, 2, 3. For m=1 and m=5, same chord length. For m=2 and m=4, same chord length. For m=3, stepping 3 gives the diameter. So chord lengths for m=1, 2, 3. Each m=1 and m=5: chord length same, number of chords? For m=1, there are 6 chords (the sides). For m=2, stepping two edges apart, which are longer diagonals, also 6 chords. For m=3, stepping three edges apart, which are diameters, 3 chords. So total chords: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15, which is C(6,2)=15. So in this case, chord lengths for m=1,2,3, with counts 6,6,3. So in general, for a regular k-gon, each chord length corresponds to a step m, where m=1,2,..., floor(k/2). For each m from 1 to floor(k/2), the number of chords is k if m ≠ k/2, but if k is even and m=k/2, then the number of chords is k/2. Wait, in the hexagon example, m=3 (which is k/2=3) gives 3 chords. So that seems to be the case. Therefore, for each m=1,2,..., floor(k/2), the number of chords with step m is:- If m &lt; k/2, then there are k chords.- If m = k/2 (only when k is even), then there are k/2 chords.But wait, in the pentagon (k=5), floor(k/2)=2. For m=1 and 2, each has 5 chords. So even when k is odd, m=1,..., floor(k/2) each have k chords. So maybe the formula is: for each m=1 to m= floor(k/2), the number of chords is k, except when k is even and m=k/2, in which case it&#39;s k/2. Therefore, the total number of chords would be k*floor(k/2) - (k/2 if k even else 0). Wait, no. For even k, floor(k/2)=k/2. So total chords would be k*(k/2 - 1) + k/2 = k*(k/2 - 1) + k/2 = k^2/2 - k + k/2 = k^2/2 - k/2 = k(k - 1)/2, which matches. Similarly, for odd k, floor(k/2)=(k - 1)/2, so total chords would be k*( (k - 1)/2 ) = k(k - 1)/2, which also matches. Therefore, the breakdown is:For each m=1 to floor(k/2):- If k is odd: all m=1,..., (k - 1)/2 have k chords each.- If k is even: m=1,..., k/2 -1 have k chords each, and m=k/2 has k/2 chords.Therefore, returning to the original problem: we need to compute the sum over all sides and diagonals (i.e., all chords) of the square of their lengths. Given that each chord length for step m is 2 sin(π m /k), as the chord length formula is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ=2π m /k, and r=1. Therefore, the square of the length is (2 sin(π m /k))^2 = 4 sin^2(π m /k). So the total sum S is the sum over all chords of 4 sin^2(π m /k). Now, since chords with the same m have the same length, we can group them. Therefore, S = sum_{m=1}^{floor(k/2)} [number of chords with step m] * 4 sin^2(π m /k). But as per the earlier breakdown, when k is even, the number of chords for m=k/2 is k/2, and for m=1 to k/2 -1, it&#39;s k. For k odd, all m=1 to (k -1)/2 have k chords each. Therefore, we can write S as:If k is even:S = 4 [ sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} k sin^2(π m /k) + (k/2) sin^2(π (k/2)/k) ]But sin^2(π (k/2)/k) = sin^2(π/2) = 1. So that term becomes (k/2)*1 = k/2. Therefore,S = 4 [ k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} sin^2(π m /k) + k/2 ]If k is odd:S = 4 [ sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} k sin^2(π m /k) ]But perhaps we can write a single formula for both cases. Let&#39;s see. For general k, whether even or odd:If we let M = floor(k/2), then S = 4 [ sum_{m=1}^M (number of chords for m) sin^2(π m /k) ]But when k is even, M = k/2, and the number of chords for m = M is k/2, else for m &lt; M, it&#39;s k. When k is odd, M = (k -1)/2, and all number of chords are k.Therefore, perhaps we can write:S = 4k sum_{m=1}^{floor(k/2)} sin^2(π m /k) - 4*(k/2)* sin^2(π (k/2)/k) if k is even, but wait, no. Wait, for even k, the sum up to m = k/2 -1 with coefficient k, and the last term m=k/2 with coefficient k/2. So S = 4 [k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} sin^2(π m /k) + (k/2) sin^2(π/2) ]Similarly, for odd k, S = 4k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} sin^2(π m /k)But sin^2(π/2) = 1, so for even k, S = 4k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} sin^2(π m /k) + 4*(k/2)*1 = 4k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} sin^2(π m /k) + 2kBut perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way to approach this sum. Let&#39;s consider using some trigonometric identities or complex analysis to compute the sum.First, note that sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2. Therefore, 4 sin^2(x) = 2(1 - cos(2x)). So perhaps we can rewrite the sum S in terms of cosines.Let me try that. For each term in the sum, 4 sin^2(π m /k) = 2(1 - cos(2π m /k)). Therefore, S is equal to:For even k:S = sum_{chords} 4 sin^2(π m /k) = sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} k * 2(1 - cos(2π m /k)) + (k/2)*2(1 - cos(π)) But cos(π) = -1, so the last term becomes (k/2)*2(1 - (-1)) = (k/2)*4 = 2k. Therefore,S = 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} (1 - cos(2π m /k)) + 2k= 2k [ ( (k/2) -1 ) - sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k) ] + 2kWait, the sum of 1 from m=1 to (k/2)-1 is (k/2 -1). Then,S = 2k [ (k/2 -1) - sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k) ] + 2k= 2k(k/2 -1) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k) + 2k= 2k(k/2 -1) + 2k - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k)= 2k(k/2 -1 +1) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k)= 2k(k/2) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k)= k^2 - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k )For even k.For odd k:Similarly, S = 4k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} sin^2(π m /k) = 4k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} [ (1 - cos(2π m /k))/2 ]= 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} (1 - cos(2π m /k))= 2k [ (k -1)/2 - sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k) ]= 2k*( (k -1)/2 ) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k )= k(k -1) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k )So, for both cases, even and odd, we have:If k is even:S = k^2 - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k/2)-1} cos(2π m /k )If k is odd:S = k(k -1) - 2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k )Therefore, the key is to compute the sum of cos(2π m /k ) for m=1 to some upper limit.Now, I need to compute these cosine sums. Let me recall that there is a formula for the sum of cosines of equally spaced angles. In general, the sum_{m=1}^{n} cos(a + (m-1)d) can be computed using the formula:[sin(n d /2) / sin(d /2)] * cos(a + (n -1)d /2 )But in our case, for even k, the sum is from m=1 to (k/2)-1 of cos(2π m /k). Similarly, for odd k, sum from m=1 to (k -1)/2 of cos(2π m /k). Let&#39;s check the even case first.Case 1: k even.Let k = 2n, so n = k/2. Then the sum is from m=1 to n -1 of cos(2π m / (2n)) = sum_{m=1}^{n -1} cos(π m /n )Similarly, for odd k, let k = 2n +1, then the sum is from m=1 to n of cos(2π m / (2n +1)).But perhaps there is a way to compute these sums. Let me try for even k first.For even k = 2n:sum_{m=1}^{n -1} cos(π m /n )We can use the formula for the sum of cosines:sum_{m=1}^{N} cos(mθ) = [sin(Nθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((N +1)θ/2 )But here, θ = π /n, and N = n -1.Therefore,sum_{m=1}^{n -1} cos(π m /n ) = [sin( (n -1)π / (2n) ) / sin( π / (2n) ) ] * cos( (n)π / (2n) )Simplify:First, (n -1)π / (2n ) = π/2 - π/(2n )Similarly, sin(π/2 - π/(2n )) = cos( π/(2n ) )Then, sin( (n -1)π/(2n) ) / sin( π/(2n ) ) = cos( π/(2n ) ) / sin( π/(2n ) ) = cot( π/(2n ) )Then, cos( (n)π/(2n )) = cos( π/2 ) = 0Wait, that&#39;s confusing. Wait, the formula gives:sum_{m=1}^{N} cos(mθ) = [ sin(Nθ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * cos( (N +1)θ / 2 )But here, θ = π /n, N = n -1Therefore,sum_{m=1}^{n -1} cos(π m /n ) = [ sin( (n -1)π / (2n) ) / sin( π / (2n ) ) ] * cos( (n π ) / (2n ) )= [ sin( (π/2 - π/(2n)) ) / sin( π/(2n ) ) ] * cos( π/2 )But cos(π/2 ) = 0, so the entire sum is zero? That can&#39;t be. Wait, but if we use this formula, we get zero? But that contradicts with the actual sum. For example, take n =2 (so k=4, a square). Then sum_{m=1}^{1} cos(π *1 /2 ) = cos(π/2 ) = 0. So yes, the sum is zero. For n=3 (k=6, hexagon), sum_{m=1}^{2} cos(π m /3 ) = cos(π/3 ) + cos(2π/3 ) = 0.5 + (-0.5 ) = 0. So again zero. Hmm, interesting. So for even k =2n, sum_{m=1}^{n -1} cos(π m /n ) = 0. That&#39;s a pattern. Therefore, for even k, the sum in question is zero. Therefore, S = k^2 - 2k *0 = k^2. Wait, but let&#39;s test with k=4.For k=4 (square), the chords are sides (length sqrt(2)), diagonals (length 2). The sum of squares of all sides and diagonals. There are 4 sides, each of length sqrt(2), so their squares sum to 4*2=8. There are 2 diagonals, each of length 2, so their squares sum to 2*4=8. Total sum is 8+8=16. If k=4, then S= k^2=16. Correct. For k=6 (hexagon), let&#39;s compute S. Each side length is 2 sin(π/6)=1, so square is 1. There are 6 sides, sum=6. Each diagonal of step m=2 (length 2 sin(2π/6)=2 sin(π/3)=sqrt(3), square is 3. There are 6 such diagonals, sum=18. The diameters (m=3) have length 2, square is 4. There are 3 diameters, sum=12. Total sum:6 +18 +12=36. If k=6, then k^2=36. Correct. So indeed, for even k, the sum S =k^2. So that&#39;s straightforward. What about odd k? Let&#39;s take k=3 (triangle). All sides and diagonals. But in a triangle, there are no diagonals; all connections are sides. Wait, no. In a triangle, the sides are the only edges, but diagonals would be the same as sides? Wait, in a triangle, there are no diagonals because all vertices are connected by sides. Wait, in a triangle (k=3), the number of diagonals is 3(3 -3)/2=0. So indeed, only sides. The sum of squares of sides: each side length is 2 sin(π/3)=sqrt(3), so square is 3. There are 3 sides, total sum=9. If k=3, using the formula for odd k: S= k(k -1) -2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k )For k=3, (k -1)/2=1. So sum_{m=1}^1 cos(2π/3 ). cos(2π/3)= -1/2. Therefore, sum= -1/2. Then,S= 3*2 -2*3*(-1/2)=6 - (-3)=6+3=9. Correct. Another example, k=5 (pentagon). The sum of squares of all sides and diagonals. In a regular pentagon, the sides have length 2 sin(π/5), diagonals have length 2 sin(2π/5). So the squares are 4 sin²(π/5) and 4 sin²(2π/5). There are 5 sides and 5 diagonals. So total sum would be 5*4 sin²(π/5) +5*4 sin²(2π/5) = 20[sin²(π/5) + sin²(2π/5)]. Let&#39;s compute this numerically. First, sin(π/5) ≈0.5878, sin²(π/5)≈0.3455. sin(2π/5)≈0.9511, sin²≈0.9045. Then sum≈0.3455 +0.9045=1.25. Therefore total sum≈20*1.25=25. Which is k²=25. Wait, 5²=25. Hmm, but according to our formula for odd k, S= k(k -1) -2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k ). For k=5, (k -1)/2=2. sum_{m=1}^2 cos(2π m /5 ). cos(2π/5)≈0.3090, cos(4π/5)=cos(π - π/5)= -cos(π/5 )≈-0.8090. Sum≈0.3090 -0.8090≈-0.5. Then,S=5*4 -2*5*(-0.5)=20 - (-5)=20+5=25. Which is k²=25. So that works.Wait a minute, so for both even and odd k, the sum S equals k². But how? For even k, we saw S=k². For odd k, in the examples, S=k² as well. Wait, but the formula for odd k is S= k(k -1) -2k sum_{m=1}^{(k -1)/2} cos(2π m /k ). But in the examples, this equals k². So is this a general result?Wait, let&#39;s take k=5. The formula gives S=5*4 -2*5*(-0.5)=20 +5=25=5². Similarly, for k=3, S=3*2 -2*3*(-0.5)=6 +3=9=3². So in these cases, S=k². Therefore, perhaps for any k, the sum S equals k². But how?Wait, maybe there&#39;s a general proof here. Let&#39;s see. If we can show that for any k, whether even or odd, the sum S=k².But why? The chord lengths squared summed over all pairs of vertices equals k². But how can that be? Let me think in terms of coordinates. Suppose we place the regular k-gon on the unit circle in the complex plane, with vertices at z_j = e^(2πi j/k) for j=0,1,...,k-1. Then, the distance between two vertices z_j and z_m is |z_j - z_m|. So the square of the distance is |z_j - z_m|² = (z_j - z_m)(overline{z_j} - overline{z_m}) = |z_j|² + |z_m|² - z_j overline{z_m} - overline{z_j} z_m = 2 - 2 Re(z_j overline{z_m}) since |z_j|=|z_m|=1.Therefore, |z_j - z_m|² = 2 - 2 cos(θ), where θ is the angle between z_j and z_m, which is 2π |j - m| /k. Which matches the chord length formula squared: (2 sin(θ/2))²=4 sin²(θ/2)=2 - 2 cosθ.Therefore, the sum over all pairs (j, m) with j ≠ m of |z_j - z_m|² = sum_{j ≠ m} [2 - 2 cos(2π |j - m| /k)].But the total number of pairs is k(k -1). Therefore, sum_{j ≠ m} |z_j - z_m|² = 2k(k -1) - 2 sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k ).But wait, in our problem, the sum S is exactly this sum over all pairs (i.e., sides and diagonals) of the squares of their lengths. Therefore, S = sum_{j ≠ m} |z_j - z_m|² = 2k(k -1) - 2 sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k )But we need to evaluate this sum. However, note that the sum over all pairs j ≠ m of cos(2π |j - m| /k ) can be simplified. Let&#39;s fix j and sum over m. For each j, sum_{m ≠ j} cos(2π |j - m| /k ). Since the polygon is regular, this sum is the same for all j. Therefore, the total sum is k * sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )Because for each j, the differences |j - m| as m ranges over all other vertices is equivalent to d=1,2,...,k-1. Therefore,sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k ) = k * sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )Therefore, S = 2k(k -1) - 2k sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )So S = 2k(k -1) - 2k sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )But what is the value of sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )? Let&#39;s compute this sum.Recall that the sum of cos(2π d /k ) from d=0 to k-1 is equal to 0. This is because those are the real parts of the roots of unity, which sum to zero. Therefore,sum_{d=0}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k ) = 0Therefore, sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k ) = -cos(0) = -1Therefore, substituting back into S:S = 2k(k -1) - 2k*(-1 ) = 2k(k -1) + 2k = 2k(k -1 +1 ) = 2k*k = 2k²Wait, hold on, that contradicts our previous examples where S was equal to k². Wait, what&#39;s wrong here?Wait, in the example of k=4, we found S=16=4², but according to this formula, S=2*4²=32. That can&#39;t be. So there&#39;s a mistake here. Let&#39;s check where.Wait, let&#39;s retrace the steps.We have S = sum_{j ≠ m} |z_j - z_m|² = sum_{j ≠ m} [2 - 2 cos(2π |j - m| /k )] = 2k(k -1) - 2 sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k )But then we said sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k ) = k * sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )But when we fix j, sum_{m ≠ j} cos(2π |j - m| /k ) = sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k ), since as m varies over m ≠ j, |j - m| takes each value d=1,...,k-1 exactly once. Therefore, summing over all j, we get k * sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )Therefore, sum_{j ≠ m} cos(2π |j - m| /k ) = k * sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k )But we know that sum_{d=0}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k ) = 0, so sum_{d=1}^{k -1} cos(2π d /k ) = -1. Therefore, sum_{j ≠ m} cos(theta) = k*(-1 )Thus, S = 2k(k -1) - 2k*(-1 ) = 2k(k -1) + 2k = 2k² -2k + 2k = 2k²But this contradicts our previous results where for k=4, S=16, but 2k²=32. So something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is to find the sum of the squares of the lengths of all sides and diagonals. But in the complex plane approach, we computed the sum over all pairs j ≠ m of |z_j - z_m|². But in the problem, sides and diagonals correspond to all edges (i.e., all pairs of vertices), so that should indeed be C(k,2) edges. However, in the complex plane approach, for each pair (j, m), we have two directed edges, but in reality, each edge is counted once. Wait, no. In the sum over all j ≠ m, we are counting each pair twice: once as (j, m) and once as (m, j). But since |z_j - z_m|² is the same as |z_m - z_j|², the total sum S as computed in the complex plane approach is equal to twice the sum over all unordered pairs. Therefore, in reality, the sum over all unordered pairs (i.e., all sides and diagonals) would be S/2. Ah! That&#39;s the key. The problem asks for the sum over all sides and diagonals, which are unordered pairs. However, in the complex plane approach, we computed the sum over all ordered pairs (j, m) with j ≠ m, which counts each unordered pair twice. Therefore, the actual sum required by the problem is S/2, where S is the sum computed in the complex plane approach. Therefore, the correct answer should be (2k²)/2 =k². Which matches our previous examples. For example, k=4: sum over all unordered pairs is 16, which is 4². For k=3: 9=3². For k=5:25=5². Therefore, this generalizes. Therefore, regardless of k, the sum of the squares of all sides and diagonals of a regular k-gon inscribed in a unit circle is k². Therefore, the answer is boxed{k^2}Final Answerboxed{k^2}&lt;/think&gt;To find the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of a regular ( k )-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1, we start by noting that all vertices lie on the unit circle. The distance between any two vertices separated by ( m ) steps (where ( m = 1, 2, ldots, k-1 )) is given by the chord length formula ( 2 sin(pi m / k) ). The square of this length is ( 4 sin^2(pi m / k) ).We need to sum these squares over all pairs of vertices. For a regular ( k )-gon, each pair of vertices corresponds to a unique chord, and the total number of such pairs is ( binom{k}{2} ). Using complex analysis, we place the vertices of the ( k )-gon on the unit circle in the complex plane. The vertices are ( z_j = e^{2pi i j / k} ) for ( j = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ). The square of the distance between two vertices ( z_j ) and ( z_m ) is ( |z_j - z_m|^2 ). The sum of the squares of the lengths of all sides and diagonals is equivalent to summing ( |z_j - z_m|^2 ) over all pairs ( j neq m ). This can be expressed as:[sum_{j neq m} |z_j - z_m|^2]Using the properties of complex numbers, we know:[|z_j - z_m|^2 = 2 - 2 cosleft(frac{2pi |j - m|}{k}right)]Summing this over all pairs ( j neq m ), we get:[sum_{j neq m} |z_j - z_m|^2 = sum_{j neq m} left(2 - 2 cosleft(frac{2pi |j - m|}{k}right)right)]This simplifies to:[2k(k - 1) - 2 sum_{j neq m} cosleft(frac{2pi |j - m|}{k}right)]The sum of the cosines over all pairs ( j neq m ) is known to be ( -k ) because the sum of the roots of unity is zero. Therefore, the total sum becomes:[2k(k - 1) - 2(-k) = 2k(k - 1) + 2k = 2k^2]However, since we need the sum over all unordered pairs (sides and diagonals), we divide by 2, resulting in:[k^2]Thus, the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of a regular ( k )-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is (boxed{k^2}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals of a regular k-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem.First, a regular k-gon means all sides and angles are equal. Since it&#39;s inscribed in a circle of radius 1, all the vertices lie on the circumference of this circle. The task is to compute the sum of the squares of all the side lengths and diagonal lengths.Let me recall that the length of a side or a diagonal in a regular polygon can be determined by the central angle subtended by the two vertices. For a regular k-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/k radians. For non-adjacent vertices, the central angle would be a multiple of this, right? For example, the next diagonal would subtend 2*2π/k, and so on.So, in general, between any two distinct vertices, the central angle θ is 2π|i - j|/k, where i and j are the indices of the two vertices. Since the polygon is regular, all sides and diagonals can be categorized by the number of edges they skip. For example, sides connect consecutive vertices (skipping 0), the next diagonals skip 1 vertex, then 2, etc., up to skipping floor(k/2)-1 vertices because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.Wait, actually, in a regular polygon, diagonals that skip m vertices are the same as those that skip k - m - 2 vertices. So, for a k-gon, the distinct diagonals can be considered for m from 1 to floor((k-1)/2). For example, in a pentagon (k=5), floor((5-1)/2)=2, so m=1 and m=2. But m=2 diagonals are the same as m=5 - 2 - 2 =1? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, for a regular polygon with k sides, the number of distinct diagonals is k(k-3)/2, but here we need to consider all possible diagonals, each corresponding to a different chord length. Each chord length corresponds to the number of edges between the two vertices. So, the chord length between two vertices separated by m edges (where m=1 is the side length, m=2 is the next diagonal, etc.) is given by the formula 2*sin(π*m/k). Wait, is that right?Wait, the chord length formula is 2*r*sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Since the radius r is 1 here, the chord length becomes 2*sin(θ/2). The central angle θ for two vertices separated by m edges is θ = 2π*m/k. Therefore, the chord length is 2*sin(π*m/k). So yes, for m=1, that&#39;s the side length: 2*sin(π/k). For m=2, 2*sin(2π/k), and so on up to m= floor(k/2). Because beyond m = floor(k/2), the chord lengths start repeating. For example, in a pentagon (k=5), m=1 and m=2 give distinct chord lengths, but m=3 would be equivalent to m=2 (since 5-3=2), and m=4 equivalent to m=1. Similarly, in a hexagon (k=6), m=1,2,3. But m=3 is the diameter (central angle π), which is a straight line. So, for even k, the maximum m is k/2, but for odd k, it&#39;s (k-1)/2.Therefore, the distinct chord lengths are for m=1 to m= floor(k/2). Each of these chord lengths corresponds to a certain number of diagonals (or sides). For m=1, it&#39;s the sides, and there are k such sides. For each m from 2 to floor(k/2), the number of diagonals corresponding to m is k, but each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), so actually k. Wait, no. In a polygon, each diagonal is uniquely determined by its two endpoints. For a given m, the number of chords (sides or diagonals) that skip m edges is k, because you can start at any vertex and connect to the m-th next vertex. However, when m and k - m would give the same chord length, but in terms of counting, if m ranges from 1 to floor(k/2), then each chord length is counted exactly once. Wait, perhaps not.Wait, actually, for each m from 1 to k-1, you can define a chord between two vertices m apart, but chords with m and k - m are congruent (same length). Therefore, the total number of chords is k for each m, but when m &gt; k/2, the chord length repeats. Therefore, to count each distinct chord length once, we consider m from 1 to floor(k/2). However, in our problem, we need to consider all sides and diagonals, which would be all chords between distinct vertices. So each chord is counted once for each pair of vertices. Therefore, the total number of sides and diagonals is C(k,2) - k = k(k-1)/2 - k = k(k-3)/2, which is the standard formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon.But here, the problem says &quot;the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals&quot;. So, we need to compute the sum over all pairs of distinct vertices of the square of the distance between them.But in a regular k-gon, the distance between two vertices separated by m edges is 2*sin(π*m/k). Therefore, the square of this distance is 4*sin²(π*m/k). So, for each m from 1 to k-1, the number of pairs of vertices separated by m edges is k (since for each vertex, there is one vertex m steps away, and since the polygon is regular, each such pair is unique). Wait, but if we fix m, then each chord is counted k times, but since each chord is shared by two vertices, we might be double-counting. Wait, no. For example, in a polygon with k vertices, for a fixed m, each vertex is connected to the vertex m steps ahead. So, there are k such chords, but each chord is shared between two vertices. Wait, no, if you have k vertices, and for each vertex, you connect to the m-th next vertex, then you end up with k chords, but if m and k - m give the same chord length, but m ranges from 1 to k-1. Wait, actually, for each m from 1 to k-1, there are exactly k chords of that type. However, when m and k - m are different, these chords have different lengths. Wait, no, when m and k - m, the chord lengths are the same because sin(π*m/k) = sin(π*(k - m)/k) since sin(π - x) = sin x. Therefore, the chord lengths for m and k - m are the same. Therefore, for m from 1 to floor(k/2), we have distinct chord lengths, each occurring k times. Except when k is even, for m = k/2, the chord length is unique (the diameter), and there are k/2 such chords. Wait, let&#39;s check:Suppose k is even, say k=6. Then m=1,2,3. For m=1 and m=5, chord lengths are the same, but since m=5 is equivalent to m=1 in terms of chord length (since 5 =6 -1). Wait, no, in k=6, m=1 and m=5 would correspond to chord lengths 2*sin(π/6) and 2*sin(5π/6). But sin(5π/6)=sin(π - π/6)=sin(π/6)=1/2, so chord lengths are the same. Therefore, in general, for each m from 1 to floor(k/2), we have chord lengths that repeat for m and k -m. Therefore, the number of distinct chord lengths is floor(k/2). However, in terms of counting the total number of chords, each m from 1 to k-1 corresponds to k chords, but each chord is counted twice (once as m and once as k - m). Except when m = k/2 (if k even), which is self-paired.Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let&#39;s take another approach. Since the polygon is regular and inscribed in a unit circle, the distance between any two vertices is determined solely by the number of edges between them. So, for each pair of vertices, the distance squared is [2*sin(π*m/k)]² = 4*sin²(π*m/k), where m is the number of edges between them (m=1,...,k-1). Each value of m corresponds to a certain chord, and for each m, there are k such chords. However, when m and k - m differ, those correspond to the same chord length. Wait, no, each m corresponds to a unique chord length, but chord lengths for m and k - m are the same. So, if we consider all pairs, each chord length is counted twice except when m = k/2 (if k is even). So, the total number of chord lengths is floor(k/2), but each (except when k is even) is counted twice. But maybe this is complicating.Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as follows: the total sum S is the sum over all pairs of distinct vertices (i,j) of |V_i - V_j|², where V_i and V_j are the position vectors of the vertices on the unit circle.But since the polygon is regular, we can use complex numbers to represent the vertices. Let me think. Let me denote the vertices as points on the complex plane, each with magnitude 1. Then the position of the m-th vertex is e^(2πi(m)/k) for m = 0,1,...,k-1.Then, the distance squared between vertex m and vertex n is |e^(2πi m/k) - e^(2πi n/k)|². Let&#39;s compute this.Recall that for complex numbers a and b, |a - b|² = |a|² + |b|² - 2 Re(a overline{b}). Since each vertex is on the unit circle, |a|² = |b|² = 1. Therefore, |a - b|² = 1 + 1 - 2 Re(a overline{b}) = 2 - 2 Re(a overline{b}).Now, a is e^(2πi m/k), and b is e^(2πi n/k). Therefore, a overline{b} = e^(2πi (m - n)/k). The real part of this is cos(2π(m - n)/k). Therefore, |a - b|² = 2 - 2 cos(2π(m - n)/k).So, the squared distance between any two vertices is 2 - 2 cos(2πd/k), where d is the minimal number of edges between them, i.e., d = |m - n| mod k, but since we can take d from 1 to k-1.Therefore, the sum S over all pairs (i,j) is the sum over all i &lt; j of |V_i - V_j|². There are C(k,2) terms in this sum. But since the polygon is regular, each pair with the same d will have the same squared distance. Therefore, for each d = 1 to k-1, there are k pairs of vertices with distance d (wait, not exactly). Wait, for each d from 1 to floor(k/2), the number of pairs separated by d edges is k. Wait, for example, in a pentagon (k=5), d=1: each vertex connects to its two neighbors, but each edge is shared by two vertices, so number of edges is k=5. Similarly, for d=2, each vertex connects to the vertex two away, and there are k=5 such diagonals. For d=3, it&#39;s equivalent to d=2 (since 5-3=2), and d=4 equivalent to d=1. So, in general, for each d from 1 to floor(k/2), the number of pairs is k. But when k is even, d=k/2 is its own mirror image, so there are k/2 pairs? Wait, no, in a hexagon (k=6), d=1: each vertex connects to two others, but there are 6 edges. For d=2: each vertex connects to two others, diagonals skipping one vertex, so 6 diagonals. For d=3: connects to the opposite vertex, which gives 3 diameters. So in general, for each d from 1 to k-1, the number of chords is k, but when d &gt; k/2, it&#39;s equivalent to k - d. Therefore, when summing over all pairs, for d from 1 to k-1, each d corresponds to k chords, but chords with d and k - d are the same. However, for the sum, since we are considering all pairs, we need to consider each d from 1 to k-1, each contributing k chords, but actually, each chord is counted once in the sum. Wait, no. Wait, when we consider all pairs (i,j) with i &lt; j, then for each pair, the minimal distance d is from 1 to floor(k/2). For example, in a pentagon, the pairs are either d=1 or d=2. In a hexagon, pairs are d=1,2,3. But for each d from 1 to floor(k/2), the number of pairs is k. For odd k: floor(k/2) = (k-1)/2. For even k: floor(k/2)=k/2. Therefore, the total number of pairs is k*floor(k/2). Wait, but in reality, the number of pairs is C(k,2)=k(k-1)/2. So, how does this reconcile?Wait, for example, take k=5. C(5,2)=10 pairs. For d=1: 5 pairs (edges). For d=2: 5 pairs (diagonals). Total 10. For k=6: C(6,2)=15. For d=1: 6 pairs. d=2:6 pairs. d=3:3 pairs. Total 6+6+3=15. So in general, for even k, the number of pairs for d=1 to d=k/2-1 is k each, and for d=k/2, it&#39;s k/2. For odd k, the number of pairs for d=1 to d=(k-1)/2 is k each. Therefore, the total sum S can be written as:If k is even:S = sum_{d=1}^{(k/2)-1} k * [2 - 2 cos(2πd/k)] + (k/2) * [2 - 2 cos(2π(k/2)/k)]= sum_{d=1}^{(k/2)-1} 2k(1 - cos(2πd/k)) + k(1 - cos(π))But cos(π) = -1, so 1 - cos(π) = 2. Therefore, the last term is k*2.If k is odd:S = sum_{d=1}^{(k-1)/2} k * [2 - 2 cos(2πd/k)]= sum_{d=1}^{(k-1)/2} 2k(1 - cos(2πd/k))But perhaps there&#39;s a way to combine these two cases using floor function or something. However, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to compute this sum without splitting into cases.Alternatively, since the problem is asking for the sum over all pairs (i,j), i ≠ j, of |V_i - V_j|², and since each vertex is on the unit circle, we can use the formula that the sum over all pairs of squared distances can be computed in terms of the coordinates of the points.Specifically, for points V_1, V_2, ..., V_k on the unit circle, the sum over all i &lt; j |V_i - V_j|² can be computed as follows.We know that |V_i - V_j|² = |V_i|² + |V_j|² - 2 V_i · V_j. Since each |V_i|² = 1, this becomes 1 + 1 - 2 V_i · V_j = 2 - 2 V_i · V_j.Therefore, the total sum S is sum_{i &lt; j} [2 - 2 V_i · V_j] = 2 * C(k,2) - 2 sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j.Now, C(k,2) is k(k-1)/2, so 2*C(k,2) = k(k-1). Therefore, S = k(k-1) - 2 sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j.Now, we need to compute sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j. Note that sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j = (1/2)[(sum_{i=1}^k V_i) · (sum_{j=1}^k V_j) - sum_{i=1}^k |V_i|²]. Since the cross terms when expanding (sum V_i)·(sum V_j) are sum_{i ≠ j} V_i · V_j, which is 2 sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j. Therefore, sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j = [ |sum V_i|² - sum |V_i|² ] / 2.Since each |V_i|² = 1, sum |V_i|² = k. Therefore, sum_{i &lt; j} V_i · V_j = [ |sum V_i|² - k ] / 2.Therefore, S = k(k - 1) - 2 * [ (|sum V_i|² - k)/2 ] = k(k - 1) - (|sum V_i|² - k) = k(k - 1) - |sum V_i|² + k = k^2 - k - |sum V_i|² + k = k^2 - |sum V_i|².Therefore, S = k² - |sum V_i|².So, the key is to compute |sum V_i|², where V_i are the vertices of the regular k-gon inscribed in the unit circle.But in a regular k-gon, the sum of all vertices (considered as complex numbers or vectors) is zero. Wait, is that true?Yes! In a regular polygon centered at the origin, the vectors sum to zero because of symmetry. For each vertex V_i, there is a diametrically opposite vertex (if k is even) or vertices that cancel out each other&#39;s contributions (if k is odd). Therefore, sum_{i=1}^k V_i = 0.Therefore, |sum V_i|² = 0. Therefore, S = k² - 0 = k².Wait, that can&#39;t be right. If all the points are on the unit circle, and we compute the sum of squared distances between all pairs, getting k²? Let&#39;s test with a simple case.Take k=3 (triangle). The vertices form an equilateral triangle inscribed in a unit circle. The distance between any two vertices is 2*sin(π/3) = √3. There are 3 sides. So the sum of squares is 3*(√3)^2 = 3*3=9. According to the formula S=k²=9. That works. Let&#39;s check another one. For k=4 (square). Each side is 2*sin(π/4)=√2, diagonals are 2 (diameters). There are 4 sides and 2 diagonals. Sum of squares: 4*(√2)^2 + 2*2² = 4*2 + 2*4=8 +8=16. And k²=16. Correct again.Another test: k=2. Wait, a digon? Not really a polygon, but if we take two points on the circle, the distance between them is 2 (diameter). The sum of squares is 2²=4. k²=4. So that works. But k=1? Not a polygon. So the formula seems to hold. So regardless of k, the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals is k². But how is that possible?Wait, for k=3: sum of squares is 9. For k=4: sum is 16. For k=5: Let&#39;s compute. Regular pentagon. Each side length is 2*sin(π/5). The diagonals are 2*sin(2π/5). There are 5 sides and 5 diagonals. So sum of squares is 5*(2*sin(π/5))² +5*(2*sin(2π/5))². Compute this:First, (2*sin(π/5))² = 4*sin²(π/5) ≈4*(0.5878)²≈4*0.345≈1.38.Similarly, (2*sin(2π/5))²=4*sin²(2π/5)≈4*(0.9511)²≈4*0.904≈3.616.So total sum≈5*(1.38 +3.616)=5*5.0≈25.0, which is k²=25. Wow, that works. So even though the individual terms involve trigonometric functions, their sum magically becomes k². That&#39;s fascinating.Therefore, the general formula is S = k². Therefore, the answer is boxed{k^2}.But wait, let me verify with another example. Take k=6. A regular hexagon. Each side is 2*sin(π/6)=1. The diagonals are of two types: those that skip one vertex (length 2*sin(2π/6)=2*sin(π/3)=√3≈1.732), and the diameters (length 2). There are 6 sides, 6 diagonals of length √3, and 3 diameters. So sum of squares is 6*(1²) +6*( (√3)^2 ) +3*(2²)=6*1 +6*3 +3*4=6 +18 +12=36. Which is 6²=36. Correct.Therefore, the pattern holds. The key insight is that the sum of the squares of all distances between pairs of vertices in a regular k-gon inscribed in a unit circle is equal to k squared.Therefore, the answer is boxed{k^2}.Final AnswerThe sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of ( P ) is boxed{k^2}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of a regular ( k )-gon inscribed in a unit circle, we start by considering the vertices of the ( k )-gon as points on the unit circle. The distance between any two vertices ( V_i ) and ( V_j ) is given by the chord length formula, which is ( 2 sin left( frac{pi |i - j|}{k} right) ). The square of this distance is ( 4 sin^2 left( frac{pi |i - j|}{k} right) ).However, a more efficient approach involves using vector properties. For any two distinct vertices ( V_i ) and ( V_j ), the squared distance between them is ( |V_i - V_j|^2 ). This can be expanded using the dot product as ( |V_i - V_j|^2 = 2 - 2 cos left( frac{2pi |i - j|}{k} right) ).The total sum ( S ) of the squares of all distances between pairs of vertices is given by summing this expression over all pairs ( (i, j) ) with ( i &lt; j ). This sum can be simplified using the properties of vectors on the unit circle. The key steps are:1. The sum of all squared distances between pairs of vertices is equivalent to ( k^2 - left| sum_{i=1}^k V_i right|^2 ).2. In a regular ( k )-gon, the vectors sum to zero due to symmetry, so ( sum_{i=1}^k V_i = 0 ).Thus, the sum ( S ) simplifies to ( k^2 - 0 = k^2 ).Therefore, the sum of the squares of the lengths of all the sides and diagonals of the regular ( k )-gon is (boxed{k^2}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ceb94754></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ceb94754><span class="icon" data-v-ceb94754>🔑:</span>Solution: Place the vertices of P at the k th roots of unity, 1, omega, omega^{2}, ldots, omega^{k-1}.

Let&#39;s start by understanding each part of the function and then check each statement one by one.First, let&#39;s recall that the absolute value function can affect the periodicity of the original function inside. The sinx + cosx term inside the absolute value might have a different period when taken absolute. Also, sin2x is a standard sine function with period π. So, the combination of these two parts could influence the overall period of f(x). Let&#39;s check each option step by step.Option A: The minimum positive period of f(x) is 2π.To find the period of f(x), we need to consider the periods of both components: 2|sinx + cosx| and sin2x. Let&#39;s first find the period of |sinx + cosx|.We know that sinx + cosx can be rewritten as √2 sin(x + π/4). This has a period of 2π. However, taking the absolute value of a sine function halves its period because |sinθ| has period π. So, |√2 sin(x + π/4)| = √2 |sin(x + π/4)|, which would have a period of π. Therefore, 2|sinx + cosx| also has a period of π.Now, sin2x has a period of π. So both components 2|sinx + cosx| and sin2x have a period of π. Therefore, their combination f(x) would also have a period of π. But wait, is there a shorter period? Let me verify.Since both parts have period π, the function f(x) would repeat every π. However, sometimes when combining functions, especially with absolute values, the period might be further reduced. Let&#39;s check if the function is actually π/2 periodic or something else.Wait, let&#39;s compute f(x + π/2):First, |sin(x + π/2) + cos(x + π/2)| = |cosx - sinx|. Then, 2|cosx - sinx| - sin[2(x + π/2)] = 2|cosx - sinx| - sin(2x + π) = 2|cosx - sinx| - (-sin2x) = 2|cosx - sinx| + sin2x.Compare with original f(x) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x. These are not the same, unless |cosx - sinx| = |sinx + cosx|, which is not generally true. For example, at x = 0: |1 - 0| = 1 vs. |0 + 1| = 1, same. At x = π/4: |cos(π/4) - sin(π/4)| = |0| = 0 vs. |√2/2 + √2/2| = √2. Different. Therefore, f(x + π/2) ≠ f(x), so the period isn&#39;t π/2. Then, since both components have period π, f(x) should have period π. But the question states that the minimum positive period is 2π. That would mean option A is incorrect. So A is false. But let me confirm once again.Wait, perhaps the combination of the two terms causes the period to double? Let&#39;s check f(x + π):Compute f(x + π) = 2|sin(x + π) + cos(x + π)| - sin[2(x + π)] = 2| -sinx - cosx| - sin(2x + 2π) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x = f(x). So yes, f(x + π) = f(x). Therefore, the period is π. Therefore, the minimal period is π, not 2π. So option A is incorrect. So A is false.Option B: x = π/4 is a symmetry axis of the graph of f(x).To check if x = π/4 is a symmetry axis, we need to verify if f(π/4 + t) = f(π/4 - t) for all t. Let&#39;s compute both sides.Let me denote t as any real number. Let&#39;s compute f(π/4 + t) and f(π/4 - t).First, compute sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t). Let&#39;s use the identity sinA + cosA = √2 sin(A + π/4). So sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t) = √2 sin(π/4 + t + π/4) = √2 sin(π/2 + t) = √2 cos t. Therefore, |sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t)| = |√2 cos t| = √2 |cos t|. So 2|sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t)| = 2 * √2 |cos t| = 2√2 |cos t|.Next, compute sin[2(π/4 + t)] = sin(π/2 + 2t) = cos2t.Therefore, f(π/4 + t) = 2√2 |cos t| - cos2t.Now compute f(π/4 - t):Similarly, sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t). Again, using the identity: sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t) = √2 sin(π/4 - t + π/4) = √2 sin(π/2 - t) = √2 cos t. Therefore, absolute value is same: √2 |cos t|. Multiply by 2: 2√2 |cos t|.Then sin[2(π/4 - t)] = sin(π/2 - 2t) = cos2t.Therefore, f(π/4 - t) = 2√2 |cos t| - cos2t.So f(π/4 + t) = f(π/4 - t). Hence, the function is symmetric about x = π/4. Therefore, option B is correct. So B is true.Option C: The minimum value of f(x) is 1.We need to find the minimum value of f(x) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x.Let me first note that |sinx + cosx| is non-negative, and sin2x can be positive or negative. Let&#39;s try to express f(x) in terms of a single variable or find critical points.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider substituting t = sinx + cosx. Then, t = √2 sin(x + π/4), so |t| ranges from 0 to √2. Also, sin2x = 2 sinx cosx. Let&#39;s express sin2x in terms of t.Note that t^2 = (sinx + cosx)^2 = sin^2x + 2 sinx cosx + cos^2x = 1 + sin2x. Therefore, sin2x = t^2 - 1.Therefore, f(x) = 2|t| - (t^2 - 1) = 2|t| - t^2 + 1.So f(x) can be written as a function of t: f(t) = -t^2 + 2|t| + 1, where t ∈ [-√2, √2]. But since |t| is used, and t can be both positive and negative, but |t| is symmetric. So we can consider t ≥ 0, since |t| is same for t and -t.Therefore, for t ≥ 0, f(t) = -t^2 + 2t + 1. For t &lt; 0, f(t) = -t^2 - 2t + 1. But since t = sinx + cosx, which can range from -√2 to √2. But given that we have |sinx + cosx|, the term inside the absolute value is non-negative, so t is non-negative. Wait, no. Wait, t is sinx + cosx, which can be negative. But when we take |t|, it&#39;s |sinx + cosx|, so the 2|t| term is 2|sinx + cosx|, which is always non-negative.Wait, but in the substitution, t = sinx + cosx, so t can be from -√2 to √2. However, in f(t) = 2|t| - (t^2 - 1) = 2|t| - t^2 + 1. So f(t) is a function of t, where t ∈ [-√2, √2].But since |t| is symmetric, we can analyze the function f(t) for t ≥ 0 and t ≤ 0.Case 1: t ≥ 0.f(t) = -t² + 2t + 1. This is a quadratic function opening downward. Its maximum is at t = -b/(2a) = -2/(2*(-1)) = 1. The maximum value is f(1) = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2. Then, as t increases beyond 1, f(t) decreases. At t = √2, f(√2) = - (√2)^2 + 2*√2 + 1 = -2 + 2√2 + 1 = (√2 - 0.5)... Wait, compute:Wait, f(√2) = - ( (√2)^2 ) + 2*(√2) + 1 = -2 + 2√2 + 1 = (-2 + 1) + 2√2 = -1 + 2√2 ≈ -1 + 2.828 ≈ 1.828.Case 2: t &lt; 0.f(t) = -t² - 2t + 1. This is another quadratic, opening downward as well. Its vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = -(-2)/(2*(-1)) = 2/(-2) = -1. So maximum at t = -1. The value is f(-1) = -1 - (-2) +1 = -1 +2 +1 = 2. Then, as t decreases from -1 to -√2, f(t) decreases. At t = -√2, f(-√2) = - ( (√2)^2 ) -2*(-√2) +1 = -2 + 2√2 +1 = same as above, -1 + 2√2 ≈1.828.But wait, in our case, t is sinx + cosx, which can be from -√2 to √2. However, when t is negative, |t| = -t, so 2|t| is 2*(-t) when t is negative. Wait, but in the substitution, we have f(t) = 2|t| - t² +1. So regardless of t&#39;s sign, 2|t| is positive. So when t is negative, f(t) = -t² -2t +1. But since t is in [-√2, √2], let&#39;s see.But to find the minimum value of f(x), which corresponds to the minimum value of f(t) over t ∈ [-√2, √2].But since when t is negative, the quadratic is -t² -2t +1. Let&#39;s analyze both cases.First, for t ≥0: f(t) = -t² +2t +1. The minimum occurs at the endpoints. Since it&#39;s a downward opening parabola, the minimum would be at t=0 or t=√2.At t=0: f(0) = -0 +0 +1=1.At t=√2: f(√2) = -2 + 2√2 +1= -1 + 2√2 ≈1.828.For t ≤0: f(t) = -t² -2t +1. This is also a downward opening parabola (since coefficient of t² is -1). The vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = -(-2)/(2*(-1))= 2/-2 = -1. So maximum at t=-1, f(-1)= -1 - (-2) +1= -1 +2 +1=2.The minimum on the interval t ∈ [-√2,0] would occur at the endpoints. At t=0: f(0)=1. At t=-√2: f(-√2) = - ( (√2)^2 ) -2*(-√2) +1= -2 +2√2 +1= -1 +2√2≈1.828.Wait, so the minimum value of f(t) is 1, which occurs at t=0. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is 1. Therefore, option C is correct.Wait, but hold on. t = sinx + cosx. When does t =0? sinx + cosx=0 =&gt; tanx = -1 =&gt; x= 3π/4 +kπ. Let&#39;s check f(x) at x=3π/4.Compute f(3π/4)= 2|sin(3π/4)+cos(3π/4)| - sin(2*(3π/4))= 2| √2/2 - √2/2 | - sin(3π/2)= 2|0| - (-1)=0 +1=1. Correct. Similarly at x=7π/4: same result.So the minimum value is indeed 1, achieved at x=3π/4 +kπ. Therefore, option C is correct.Option D: f(x) is monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2].To check if f(x) is increasing on [π/4, π/2], let&#39;s compute its derivative and see if it&#39;s non-negative in that interval.First, let&#39;s find f&#39;(x). f(x)=2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x.The derivative of 2|sinx + cosx| is 2 * sign(sinx + cosx) * (cosx - sinx). Because d/dx |u| = sign(u) * u&#39;.So f&#39;(x) = 2 * sign(sinx + cosx) * (cosx - sinx) - 2cos2x.Now, we need to consider the interval [π/4, π/2]. Let&#39;s check the sign of sinx + cosx in this interval.At x=π/4: sin(π/4) + cos(π/4)= √2/2 + √2/2=√2&gt;0. At x=π/2: sin(π/2)+cos(π/2)=1 +0=1&gt;0. So in [π/4, π/2], sinx + cosx is positive. Therefore, sign(sinx + cosx)=1.Therefore, f&#39;(x)=2*(cosx - sinx) - 2cos2x.Simplify:f&#39;(x)=2(cosx - sinx) - 2cos2x.Let me write cos2x in terms of sinx and cosx: cos2x = cos²x - sin²x = (cosx - sinx)(cosx + sinx). Alternatively, keep as is.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute f&#39;(x):=2cosx -2sinx -2cos2x.Now, let&#39;s see if this derivative is non-negative on [π/4, π/2].Let’s compute f’(x) at x=π/4:cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2, cos2x=cos(π/2)=0.So f’(π/4)=2*(√2/2 - √2/2) -0=0 -0=0.At x=π/2:cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1, cos2x=cosπ=-1.f’(π/2)=2*(0 -1) -2*(-1)= -2 +2=0.Now, let&#39;s check the derivative in the middle, say x=π/3 (which is in [π/4, π/2]).x=π/3: cosx=0.5, sinx=√3/2≈0.866, cos2x=cos(2π/3)= -0.5.f’(π/3)=2*(0.5 - √3/2) -2*(-0.5)=2*(0.5 -0.866) +1=2*(-0.366)+1≈-0.732+1=0.268&gt;0.Another point, x=3π/8 (which is 67.5 degrees):cosx=cos(3π/8)= approx 0.3827, sinx=sin(3π/8)= approx 0.9239, cos2x=cos(3π/4)= -√2/2≈-0.7071.f’(3π/8)=2*(0.3827 -0.9239) -2*(-0.7071)=2*(-0.5412) +1.4142≈-1.0824 +1.4142≈0.3318&gt;0.So between π/4 and π/2, the derivative starts at 0, becomes positive, and ends at 0. Wait, but according to the computation at π/3 and 3π/8, it&#39;s positive. So is the derivative always non-negative in [π/4, π/2]?Wait, maybe we need to analyze the derivative more carefully. Let&#39;s express f’(x):f’(x)=2(cosx - sinx) -2cos2x.Let&#39;s try to simplify this expression. Let&#39;s factor out 2:f’(x)=2[ (cosx - sinx) - cos2x ].Express cos2x as cos^2x - sin^2x:But maybe another identity. Let me think.Alternatively, use cos2x = 1 - 2sin²x. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, rewrite (cosx - sinx) - cos2x.Let’s note that cosx - sinx = √2 cos(x + π/4). Similarly, cos2x = sin(π/2 - 2x). Not sure if helpful.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute:(cosx - sinx) - cos2x.Let’s substitute cos2x = cos²x - sin²x. Then:cosx - sinx - (cos²x - sin²x) = cosx - sinx - cos²x + sin²x.Hmm, not sure. Maybe group terms:= cosx - cos²x - sinx + sin²x = cosx(1 - cosx) - sinx(1 - sinx).Not helpful. Let&#39;s try to write sin²x = 1 - cos²x.But perhaps another approach. Let&#39;s consider specific substitutions.Alternatively, note that cosx - sinx = √2 cos(x + π/4). Then:f’(x)=2[√2 cos(x + π/4) - cos2x ].But not sure. Let me compute f’(x):Let’s let’s compute f’(x):=2cosx -2sinx -2cos2x.Let me write cos2x in terms of sinx and cosx:cos2x = 2cos²x -1. Then,f’(x)=2cosx -2sinx -2(2cos²x -1)=2cosx -2sinx -4cos²x +2.= -4cos²x +2cosx -2sinx +2.Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sinx.Alternatively, maybe take a numerical approach. Let&#39;s check the derivative at a few points:At x=π/4: f’(x)=0.At x=π/3: f’(x)=0.268&gt;0.At x=3π/8≈1.178: f’(x)= approx 0.3318&gt;0.At x approaching π/2:As x approaches π/2, cosx approaches 0, sinx approaches 1, cos2x approaches -1.f’(x)=2*(0 -1) -2*(-1)= -2 +2=0.So derivative starts at 0, increases to positive, then decreases back to 0 at π/2. So is the derivative always non-negative in [π/4, π/2]?To check this, let&#39;s check if f’(x) has any critical points in (π/4, π/2). Let&#39;s compute the second derivative.But maybe too complicated. Alternatively, analyze the function f’(x).Alternatively, let&#39;s see if f’(x) can be written in a way that shows it&#39;s non-negative.Wait, f’(x)=2(cosx - sinx) -2cos2x.Let me factor out the 2:f’(x)=2[(cosx - sinx) - cos2x].Let’s compute (cosx - sinx) - cos2x.= cosx - sinx - cos2x.Hmm. Let&#39;s use the identity cos2x = cos^2x - sin^2x.So,= cosx - sinx - (cos^2x - sin^2x).= cosx - sinx - cos^2x + sin^2x.= cosx(1 - cosx) + sinx(sinx -1).Hmm, still not helpful. Alternatively, factor terms:= cosx - cos^2x - sinx + sin^2x.= cosx(1 - cosx) + sinx(-1 + sinx).Alternatively, factor as follows:= (cosx - cos^2x) + (-sinx + sin^2x).= cosx(1 - cosx) - sinx(1 - sinx).Not helpful. Let me try substitution.Let’s let t = x - π/4. Then, when x = π/4 + t, t ranges from 0 to π/4 in the interval [π/4, π/2].But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, consider substituting t = x.Alternatively, since the expression is a bit messy, maybe consider that since the derivative starts at 0, goes positive, and ends at 0, but we need to check if it ever becomes negative in between.But from the sample points we checked (π/3 and 3π/8), the derivative was positive. Let&#39;s check another point, say x=5π/16 (~56.25 degrees). Wait, 5π/16 is less than π/4 (~0.785), but we need to check in [π/4, π/2]. Let&#39;s take x=π/2 - ε, where ε is small. For example, x=π/2 - 0.1 (~1.4708).Compute f’(x)=2(cosx - sinx) -2cos2x.cos(π/2 -0.1)=sin0.1≈0.0998sin(π/2 -0.1)=cos0.1≈0.9952cos2x=cos(2*(π/2 -0.1))=cos(π -0.2)= -cos0.2≈-0.9801Thus, f’(x)=2*(0.0998 -0.9952) -2*(-0.9801)=2*(-0.8954) +1.9602≈-1.7908 +1.9602≈0.1694&gt;0.So even near π/2, the derivative is still positive. So in the interval [π/4, π/2], the derivative is non-negative (starts at 0, becomes positive, and ends at 0). Therefore, f(x) is increasing on this interval.Wait, but if the derivative starts at 0, increases to a maximum, then decreases back to 0, but remains non-negative throughout, then the function is indeed monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Because even though the derivative decreases after a certain point, as long as it&#39;s non-negative, the function is non-decreasing.But in our case, the derivative is always non-negative in [π/4, π/2], as our sample points suggest. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Hence, option D is correct.Wait, but let&#39;s verify with another example. Suppose x=3π/8 (~67.5 degrees):f’(3π/8)=2*(cos(3π/8)-sin(3π/8)) -2cos(3π/4)cos(3π/8)≈0.3827, sin(3π/8)≈0.9239, cos(3π/4)= -√2/2≈-0.7071So f’=2*(0.3827 -0.9239) -2*(-0.7071)=2*(-0.5412)+1.4142≈-1.0824 +1.4142≈0.3318&gt;0Positive. So in all tested points, the derivative is positive. Therefore, even though the derivative starts and ends at zero, it doesn&#39;t dip below zero in between. Therefore, the function is indeed monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. So option D is correct.Wait, but another thought: if the derivative is positive throughout the open interval (π/4, π/2), then even though at the endpoints it&#39;s zero, the function is still non-decreasing on the closed interval. But since the derivative is positive in the interior, it&#39;s strictly increasing. So yes, D is correct.Summary:A: False (period is π)B: TrueC: TrueD: TrueWait, but let me check again option D. Suppose we take two points in [π/4, π/2], say x1=π/4 and x2=π/2. f(π/4)=2|sin(π/4)+cos(π/4)| - sin(π/2)=2*(√2) -1≈2*1.414 -1≈2.828 -1=1.828.f(π/2)=2|sin(π/2)+cos(π/2)| - sin(π)=2*(1 +0) -0=2.So from x=π/4 to x=π/2, f(x) increases from ~1.828 to 2. So it&#39;s indeed increasing. And since the derivative is non-negative throughout, the function is monotonically increasing. So D is correct.But wait, is the derivative ever zero in the interior? At x=π/4, derivative is zero, but what about other points?Wait, if the derivative is positive everywhere in (π/4, π/2), then the function is strictly increasing. But if the derivative is zero at some point in the interior, it might not be strictly increasing, but still non-decreasing. However, according to our earlier calculations, the derivative is positive in (π/4, π/2). For example, at x=π/3, derivative≈0.268&gt;0, at x=3π/8≈0.3318&gt;0, near π/2≈0.1694&gt;0. So the derivative is positive throughout the open interval, so function is strictly increasing. Therefore, D is correct.So all options B, C, D are correct. But wait, the original options are A,B,C,D. Wait, but the problem says &quot;then ()&quot; with options. Usually, in Chinese exams, multiple options can be correct. So need to check if all B, C, D are correct.But let me verify once again.Rechecking Option C:We found that the minimum value is 1, achieved when t=0, which corresponds to x=3π/4 +kπ. Therefore, yes, the minimum value is 1, so C is correct.Rechecking Option D:Yes, derivative is non-negative in [π/4, π/2], so function is increasing there.Rechecking Option B:Symmetry about x=π/4 is confirmed by f(π/4 +t)=f(π/4 -t), so B is correct.Rechecking Option A:Period is π, not 2π, so A is incorrect.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D.But let me check the original problem statement. It&#39;s a Chinese problem, possibly from Gaokao or similar. The options are labeled A, B, C, D, and usually, the answer could be multiple. The question says &quot;then ()&quot;, and the options are given. So in the problem statement, the user will input the correct options. Since in the instructions, the user says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, likely as boxed{BCD}. But need to confirm if the system expects multiple answers boxed together.Alternatively, check the problem&#39;s origin. In Chinese multiple-choice questions with multiple correct answers, the standard is to list all correct options. So if B, C, D are correct, then the answer is B, C, D.But let me check once again:Option C: The minimum value is 1. Correct, as shown.Option D: Increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Correct.Option B: Symmetry axis at x=π/4. Correct.Option A: Period 2π. Incorrect, period is π.Hence, the correct options are B, C, D.Final Answerboxed{BCD}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x + cos x| - sin 2x ), we need to determine which of the options A, B, C, D are correct.Option A: The minimum positive period of ( f(x) ) is ( 2pi ).- The function ( sin x + cos x ) can be rewritten as ( sqrt{2} sin(x + pi/4) ), which has a period of ( 2pi ). However, taking the absolute value halves the period to ( pi ).- The term ( sin 2x ) has a period of ( pi ).- Both components ( 2|sin x + cos x| ) and ( sin 2x ) have a period of ( pi ), so the period of ( f(x) ) is ( pi ).- Therefore, option A is incorrect.Option B: ( x = frac{pi}{4} ) is a symmetry axis of the graph of ( f(x) ).- We need to verify if ( f(pi/4 + t) = f(pi/4 - t) ) for all ( t ).- Both ( f(pi/4 + t) ) and ( f(pi/4 - t) ) simplify to ( 2sqrt{2} |cos t| - cos 2t ), confirming symmetry.- Therefore, option B is correct.Option C: The minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 1.- Express ( f(x) ) in terms of ( t = sin x + cos x ), which gives ( f(t) = -t^2 + 2|t| + 1 ).- The minimum value occurs at ( t = 0 ), giving ( f(0) = 1 ).- Therefore, option C is correct.Option D: ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on ( [frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}] ).- Compute the derivative ( f&#39;(x) = 2(cos x - sin x) - 2cos 2x ).- In the interval ( [frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}] ), ( sin x + cos x ) is positive, leading to ( f&#39;(x) ) being non-negative.- The derivative is non-negative throughout the interval, indicating ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing.- Therefore, option D is correct. Final Answerboxed{BCD},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to analyze the function f(x) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x and check which of the options A, B, C, D are correct. Let&#39;s take each option one by one, but first, maybe I should understand the function a bit better.Starting with the function: f(x) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x. Hmm. The absolute value complicates things a bit, and the sin2x term is a standard sine function with double angle. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify or rewrite this function to make analysis easier.First, let&#39;s consider the expression inside the absolute value: sinx + cosx. I remember that sinx + cosx can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Specifically, sinx + cosx = √2 sin(x + π/4). Let me verify that:Using the identity: a sinx + b cosx = √(a² + b²) sin(x + φ), where φ = arctan(b/a) if a ≠ 0. Here, a = 1 and b = 1, so √(1 + 1) = √2, and φ = arctan(1/1) = π/4. So yes, sinx + cosx = √2 sin(x + π/4). Therefore, |sinx + cosx| = √2 |sin(x + π/4)|. Therefore, 2|sinx + cosx| becomes 2*√2 |sin(x + π/4)| = 2√2 |sin(x + π/4)|.So f(x) = 2√2 |sin(x + π/4)| - sin2x.Hmm, maybe that&#39;s helpful. Let&#39;s see. The first term is an absolute value of a sine function shifted by π/4, scaled by 2√2, and then subtracting sin2x. Let&#39;s note that the period of the first term, 2√2 |sin(x + π/4)|, is π, since the absolute value of sine has half the period of the original sine function. The original sin(x + π/4) has period 2π, so |sin(x + π/4)| has period π. Similarly, sin2x has period π. So both terms have period π. Therefore, the function f(x) might have period π, but maybe not? Wait, but let&#39;s check if combining them could result in a smaller period or if their combination still has period π. Since both terms have period π, their combination should also have period π. But maybe there&#39;s a symmetry that makes the period smaller? Let me check.Wait, but the options say the minimum positive period is 2π (option A). So if I can show that the period is π, then A is wrong, otherwise if it&#39;s 2π, then A is correct. Let&#39;s check for periodicity. Let&#39;s see if f(x + π) = f(x). Let&#39;s compute:f(x + π) = 2|sin(x + π) + cos(x + π)| - sin[2(x + π)].sin(x + π) = -sinx, cos(x + π) = -cosx. Therefore, sin(x + π) + cos(x + π) = -sinx - cosx = -(sinx + cosx). Taking absolute value, |-(sinx + cosx)| = |sinx + cosx|. Therefore, 2|sin(x + π) + cos(x + π)| = 2|sinx + cosx|.Now, sin[2(x + π)] = sin(2x + 2π) = sin2x, since sin is 2π periodic. Therefore, f(x + π) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x = f(x). Therefore, f(x) is periodic with period π. Therefore, the minimum positive period cannot be 2π, it&#39;s actually π. Therefore, option A is incorrect. So A is wrong.Moving on to option B: x = π/4 is a symmetry axis of the graph of f(x). Hmm. So we need to check if f(π/4 + t) = f(π/4 - t) for all t. Let&#39;s verify this.Let’s compute f(π/4 + t) and f(π/4 - t) and see if they are equal.First, compute f(π/4 + t):= 2|sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t)| - sin[2(π/4 + t)]Simplify sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t):Using the identity sin(a + b) + cos(a + b). Let&#39;s compute:sin(π/4 + t) = sinπ/4 cost + cosπ/4 sint = (√2/2)(cost + sint)cos(π/4 + t) = cosπ/4 cost - sinπ/4 sint = (√2/2)(cost - sint)Therefore, sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t) = (√2/2)(cost + sint) + (√2/2)(cost - sint) = √2/2 (2cost) = √2 costSo |sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t)| = |√2 cost| = √2 |cost|Therefore, 2|sin(π/4 + t) + cos(π/4 + t)| = 2 * √2 |cost| = 2√2 |cost|Now, the second term: sin[2(π/4 + t)] = sin(π/2 + 2t) = cos2tTherefore, f(π/4 + t) = 2√2 |cost| - cos2tSimilarly, compute f(π/4 - t):= 2|sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t)| - sin[2(π/4 - t)]Similarly, sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t):sin(π/4 - t) = sinπ/4 cos(-t) + cosπ/4 sin(-t) = √2/2 (cos t - sint)cos(π/4 - t) = cosπ/4 cos(-t) + sinπ/4 sin(-t) = √2/2 (cos t + sint)Therefore, sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t) = √2/2 (cos t - sint) + √2/2 (cos t + sint) = √2/2 (2cos t) = √2 cos tTherefore, |sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t)| = |√2 cos t| = √2 |cos t|Thus, 2|sin(π/4 - t) + cos(π/4 - t)| = 2√2 |cos t|Now, sin[2(π/4 - t)] = sin(π/2 - 2t) = cos2tTherefore, f(π/4 - t) = 2√2 |cos t| - cos2tComparing f(π/4 + t) and f(π/4 - t), both equal 2√2 |cost| - cos2t. Therefore, they are equal. Therefore, f(π/4 + t) = f(π/4 - t), which means that the graph is symmetric about x = π/4. Therefore, option B is correct. So B is true.Moving on to option C: The minimum value of f(x) is 1. Let&#39;s check this.First, let&#39;s try to find the minimum of f(x). Since f(x) is periodic with period π, we can analyze it over an interval of length π, say from 0 to π.But maybe a better approach is to split the function into parts where sinx + cosx is positive or negative, to remove the absolute value.First, sinx + cosx = √2 sin(x + π/4). So sin(x + π/4) is non-negative when x + π/4 ∈ [0, π] mod 2π, i.e., x ∈ [-π/4, 3π/4] mod 2π. Similarly, negative otherwise.But since the function has period π, as established earlier, we can analyze it over an interval of π. Let&#39;s choose [-π/4, 3π/4], but perhaps it&#39;s easier to shift the interval. Alternatively, let&#39;s analyze over [0, π].But maybe even better to consider the expression for f(x):We had f(x) = 2|sinx + cosx| - sin2x.Let’s denote s = sinx + cosx. Then, |s| = √(1 + sin2x) because s^2 = sin²x + cos²x + 2 sinx cosx = 1 + sin2x. So |s| = √(1 + sin2x). Therefore, 2|s| = 2√(1 + sin2x). Therefore, f(x) = 2√(1 + sin2x) - sin2x.Hmm, so f(x) can be written as 2√(1 + sin2x) - sin2x. Let’s set y = sin2x. Then, since sin2x ∈ [-1, 1], y ∈ [-1, 1]. So f(x) = 2√(1 + y) - y. Let’s analyze this as a function of y. Let’s denote g(y) = 2√(1 + y) - y. We need to find the minimum of g(y) for y ∈ [-1, 1].Compute derivative of g(y): g’(y) = 2*(1/(2√(1 + y))) - 1 = (1/√(1 + y)) - 1.Set derivative to zero: (1/√(1 + y)) - 1 = 0 → 1/√(1 + y) = 1 → √(1 + y) = 1 → 1 + y = 1 → y = 0.So critical point at y = 0. Also, check endpoints y = -1 and y = 1.Compute g(-1): 2√(1 -1) - (-1) = 2*0 +1 = 1.g(0): 2√(1 +0) -0 = 2*1 = 2.g(1): 2√(2) -1 ≈ 2*1.414 -1 ≈ 2.828 -1 ≈ 1.828.So the minimum of g(y) occurs at y = -1, which gives g(-1) = 1. So the minimum value of f(x) is 1. Therefore, option C is correct.Wait, but we have to check if y = sin2x can actually attain -1. Since sin2x = -1 when 2x = 3π/2 + 2kπ → x = 3π/4 + kπ. For example, x = 3π/4. Let’s check f(3π/4):f(3π/4) = 2|sin(3π/4) + cos(3π/4)| - sin(2*(3π/4)) = 2|√2/2 - √2/2| - sin(3π/2) = 2|0| - (-1) = 0 +1 = 1. So yes, the function attains 1. So the minimum value is indeed 1, so option C is correct.Now, option D: f(x) is monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Let&#39;s check this.First, let&#39;s consider x ∈ [π/4, π/2]. Let&#39;s analyze f(x) in this interval. Let&#39;s note that in this interval, x ranges from π/4 to π/2. Let&#39;s see if sinx + cosx is positive here. Let&#39;s check at x = π/4: sin(π/4) + cos(π/4) = √2/2 + √2/2 = √2 &gt;0. At x = π/2: sin(π/2) + cos(π/2) = 1 + 0 = 1 &gt;0. So in [π/4, π/2], sinx + cosx is positive, so |sinx + cosx| = sinx + cosx. Therefore, in this interval, f(x) = 2(sinx + cosx) - sin2x.So f(x) = 2 sinx + 2 cosx - sin2x.We can compute the derivative of f(x) in this interval to check if it&#39;s increasing.Compute f&#39;(x):= 2 cosx - 2 sinx - 2 cos2x.Wait, derivative of 2 sinx + 2 cosx is 2 cosx - 2 sinx. Derivative of -sin2x is -2 cos2x. Therefore, f’(x) = 2 cosx - 2 sinx - 2 cos2x.We need to check if f’(x) ≥ 0 for x ∈ [π/4, π/2].Simplify f’(x):= 2 cosx - 2 sinx - 2 cos2x.Factor out 2: 2[cosx - sinx - cos2x].Let’s see if we can simplify cosx - sinx - cos2x.Use the identity cos2x = cos²x - sin²x. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of cosx + sinx.Alternatively, maybe express cos2x in terms of 1 - 2 sin²x or 2 cos²x -1. Wait, maybe better to write cos2x = (cosx - sinx)(cosx + sinx). But not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s note that:cosx - sinx - cos2x = cosx - sinx - (2cos²x -1)= cosx - sinx -2cos²x +1= -2cos²x + cosx - sinx +1Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps substitute specific values in the interval to check the sign.Let’s compute f’(x) at x = π/4:cos(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/4) = √2/2, cos2x = cos(π/2) = 0.Therefore, f’(π/4) = 2*(√2/2 - √2/2 -0) = 2*(0) = 0.At x = π/2:cos(π/2) = 0, sin(π/2) =1, cos2x = cosπ = -1.Therefore, f’(π/2) = 2*(0 -1 - (-1)) = 2*(0 -1 +1) = 2*0 =0.Hmm, derivative is zero at both ends. Let&#39;s check somewhere in the middle, say x = 3π/8.x = 3π/8, which is 67.5 degrees.Compute cosx = cos(3π/8) ≈ cos(67.5°) ≈ 0.3827sinx = sin(3π/8) ≈ 0.9239cos2x = cos(3π/4) = -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071Therefore, f’(3π/8) ≈ 2*(0.3827 - 0.9239 - (-0.7071)) = 2*(0.3827 -0.9239 +0.7071) ≈ 2*(0.3827 +0.7071 -0.9239) ≈ 2*(0.1659) ≈ 0.3318 &gt;0.So positive at 3π/8. Let&#39;s check another point, say x = π/3 (≈1.047), which is within [π/4, π/2].cos(π/3) =0.5, sin(π/3)=√3/2≈0.866, cos2x = cos(2π/3)= -0.5f’(π/3) = 2*(0.5 - √3/2 - (-0.5)) = 2*(0.5 -0.866 +0.5) = 2*(0.5 +0.5 -0.866) = 2*(1 -0.866) = 2*(0.134)=0.268 &gt;0.So positive at π/3. Hmm. So the derivative is positive in the middle of the interval and zero at the endpoints. Therefore, is the function increasing on [π/4, π/2]? Wait, if the derivative is positive in the interior and zero at the endpoints, then the function is increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Because the derivative is non-negative (positive in the interior, zero at endpoints), so the function is non-decreasing. But since the derivative is positive in the interior, the function is actually increasing (strictly) on [π/4, π/2].Wait, but let&#39;s confirm by checking another point. Let&#39;s take x = 5π/16 (halfway between π/4 and 3π/8).x = 5π/16 ≈ 56.25 degrees.cosx ≈ cos(56.25°) ≈0.5556sinx ≈0.8315cos2x = cos(5π/8) ≈cos(112.5°)≈ -0.3827f’(5π/16) ≈2*(0.5556 -0.8315 - (-0.3827)) =2*(0.5556 -0.8315 +0.3827)≈2*(0.5556 +0.3827 -0.8315)≈2*(0.1068)≈0.2136&gt;0.Still positive. Let&#39;s check near the upper end, say x = 7π/16 (≈78.75 degrees).x=7π/16cosx≈0.1951sinx≈0.9808cos2x=cos(7π/8)=cos(157.5°)≈-0.9239f’(7π/16)≈2*(0.1951 -0.9808 -(-0.9239))=2*(0.1951 -0.9808 +0.9239)=2*(0.1951 +0.9239 -0.9808)=2*(0.0382)=0.0764&gt;0.Still positive, though closer to zero. So derivative is positive throughout (π/4, π/2), zero at endpoints. So f(x) is increasing on [π/4, π/2]. Therefore, option D is correct.But wait, just to be thorough, let&#39;s consider the derivative function. Suppose the derivative starts at zero, increases to a maximum positive value, then decreases back to zero. But since we saw that at x=3π/8, π/3, 5π/16, 7π/16, the derivative is positive, it suggests that the function is increasing on the entire interval. Therefore, the answer is D is correct.Therefore, options B, C, D are correct. Wait, but let me check again.Wait, in the problem statement, the options are:A: Period 2π. We said it&#39;s π, so A is wrong.B: x=π/4 is a symmetry axis. We showed f(π/4 + t) = f(π/4 - t), so B is correct.C: Minimum value is 1. We showed f(x) reaches 1, which is the minimum, so C is correct.D: Monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. We checked derivative is non-negative (positive inside, zero at endpoints), so it&#39;s increasing. So D is correct.Wait, but let me check again for option C. The minimum value is 1. We saw that f(x) = 1 at x =3π/4, which is in the interval [0, π], but we also need to confirm that there are no lower values. Since we converted the function into g(y) = 2√(1 + y) - y, and found its minimum at y = -1 (which gives 1), and since y = sin2x can indeed reach -1, then yes, the minimum is 1. So C is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D. But let me check the original options again.Wait, the problem lists options A, B, C, D. So the answer is which of these are correct. So according to my analysis, B, C, D are correct. But let me verify once more.Wait, I need to check if perhaps option C is incorrect. Wait, when y = -1, sin2x = -1, which occurs at x = 3π/4 + kπ. Let&#39;s compute f(x) there.At x=3π/4, sinx + cosx = sin(3π/4) + cos(3π/4) = √2/2 - √2/2 = 0. So 2|sinx + cosx| = 0, and sin2x = sin(3π/2) = -1. Therefore, f(x) = 0 - (-1) = 1. Similarly, at x =7π/4, same thing. So yes, the minimum value is indeed 1. So C is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D. Wait, but let me check the original problem statement again. The options are A, B, C, D. So if the answer is multiple, but in Chinese exams sometimes they have multiple correct, but here the user hasn&#39;t specified, but given the options, each is a separate statement.But the user hasn&#39;t specified if multiple options can be correct, but in the problem, they are presented as separate options. So according to the analysis, B, C, D are correct. But let me check once more.Wait, the problem says &quot;then ()&quot; with options A, B, C, D. So in Chinese tests, usually multiple can be correct. But according to the problem, maybe.But let&#39;s check the initial problem again:&quot;Given the function f(x)=2|sinx + cosx|−sin2x, then ()A: The minimum positive period of f(x) is 2πB: x=π/4 is a symmetry axis of the graph of f(x)C: The minimum value of f(x) is 1D: f(x) is monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]&quot;So all four options are possible answers, and the user is to select which are correct. In the original instructions, the user hasn&#39;t specified if multiple can be correct, but given the way the problem is structured, it&#39;s likely multiple are correct.But the original problem is in Chinese, translated, but in Chinese exams, multiple options can be correct.Therefore, according to my analysis, B, C, D are correct, and A is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is B, C, D.But I need to check if the options are presented as checkboxes or radio buttons. Since the user hasn&#39;t specified, but given that options are labeled A, B, C, D, likely in the original problem, multiple may be correct.Therefore, the final answer is options B, C, D.But let me check once more for D: f(x) is monotonically increasing on [π/4, π/2]. We saw that the derivative is positive in the interior, zero at endpoints, so it&#39;s non-decreasing. But strictly increasing? Since the derivative is positive in the interior, the function is strictly increasing on (π/4, π/2), hence on the closed interval [π/4, π/2], it&#39;s monotonically increasing (since at the endpoints, the function is at local minima/maxima? Wait, but if derivative is zero at the endpoints, but increasing throughout the interior, then yes, it&#39;s monotonically increasing on the interval. For example, consider f(x) = x^3 on [-1,1]. The derivative at 0 is zero, but it&#39;s still increasing. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if the derivative is non-negative over the interval, then the function is non-decreasing. If the derivative is positive except at isolated points, it&#39;s still non-decreasing, but strictly increasing requires derivative positive everywhere. However, in our case, derivative is positive in (π/4, π/2), and zero at the endpoints. So the function is increasing on [π/4, π/2] because it doesn&#39;t decrease anywhere in the interval. For example, if a function has derivative zero at a point but increasing just before and after, it&#39;s still considered non-decreasing. But in our case, since the derivative is non-negative throughout the interval, it&#39;s non-decreasing, but since the derivative is positive except at the endpoints, it&#39;s strictly increasing on the open interval. However, the term &quot;monotonically increasing&quot; can sometimes allow for intervals where the derivative is zero at isolated points. So if the function does not decrease over the entire interval, then it&#39;s considered monotonically increasing. For example, the function f(x) = x^3 is monotonically increasing on [-1,1] even though the derivative at 0 is zero. Similarly, our function here has derivative zero at the endpoints but positive in between. However, in the case of endpoints, at x = π/4, the derivative is zero, but immediately after π/4, the derivative becomes positive. Similarly, at x=π/2, the derivative is zero, but just before π/2, it&#39;s positive. Therefore, the function is increasing on [π/4, π/2], since it never decreases. Therefore, option D is correct.Therefore, my final conclusion is that options B, C, D are correct. Therefore, the answer is boxed{BCD}Final Answerboxed{BCD}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( f(x) = 2|sin x + cos x| - sin 2x ), we need to analyze the given options:A: The minimum positive period of ( f(x) ) is ( 2pi ).- The function ( 2|sin x + cos x| ) can be rewritten as ( 2sqrt{2} |sin(x + pi/4)| ), which has a period of ( pi ).- The term ( sin 2x ) also has a period of ( pi ).- Therefore, the function ( f(x) ) has a period of ( pi ), not ( 2pi ). Hence, option A is incorrect.B: ( x = frac{pi}{4} ) is a symmetry axis of the graph of ( f(x) ).- We checked if ( f(pi/4 + t) = f(pi/4 - t) ). Both expressions simplify to ( 2sqrt{2} |cos t| - cos 2t ), confirming symmetry. Hence, option B is correct.C: The minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 1.- By analyzing ( f(x) ) as ( 2sqrt{1 + sin 2x} - sin 2x ), we found the minimum value occurs at ( sin 2x = -1 ), giving ( f(x) = 1 ). Hence, option C is correct.D: ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on ( [frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}] ).- We computed the derivative ( f&#39;(x) = 2(cos x - sin x - cos 2x) ) and found it non-negative (positive in the interior, zero at endpoints) in the interval ( [frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}] ). Hence, option D is correct.Thus, the correct options are (boxed{BCD}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ceb94754></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ceb94754><span class="icon" data-v-ceb94754>🔑:</span>Given the function fleft(xright)=2|sin x+cos x|-sin 2x, we analyze the options provided:Periodicity:First, let&#39;s check the periodicity of f(x):begin{align*}fleft(x+pi right) &amp;= 2|sin left(x+pi right)+cos left(x+pi right)|-sin 2left(x+pi right) &amp;= 2|-sin x - cos x| + sin 2x &amp;= 2|sin x + cos x| - sin 2x &amp;= fleft(xright)end{align*}This shows that pi is a period of f(x). Therefore, the minimum positive period of f(x) could be pi or a divisor of pi, making option A incorrect.Symmetry:Next, we examine the symmetry of f(x):begin{align*}fleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright) &amp;= 2|sinleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright)+cosleft(frac{pi}{2}-xright)|-sinleft(2left(frac{pi}{2}-xright)right) &amp;= 2|cos x + sin x| - sin(pi - 2x) &amp;= 2|sin x + cos x| - (-sin 2x) &amp;= 2|sin x + cos x| - sin 2x &amp;= f(x)end{align*}This confirms that x=frac{pi}{4} is a symmetry axis of the graph of f(x), making option B correct.Minimum Value:For the minimum value, let |sinx+cosx|=tin[0,sqrt{2}], then sin 2x=2sin xcos x=2t^2-1. The function becomes y=-t^{2}+2t+1, which is a parabola opening downwards. It increases on left[0,1right] and decreases on [1,sqrt{2}]. At t=0, f(x) achieves the minimum value of 1, confirming option C is correct.Monotonicity on [frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2}]:Finally, for the monotonicity on [frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2}], we have t=|sin x+cos x|=sqrt{2}sin(x+frac{pi}{4}). Since x+frac{pi}{4}in[frac{pi}{2},frac{3pi}{4}], the function t=sqrt{2}sin(x+frac{pi}{4}) is decreasing on [frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2}], and tin[1,sqrt{2}]. However, since y=-t^{2}+2t+1 is decreasing on [1,sqrt{2}], the composition of these functions, f(x), actually shows a decrease in t leading to an increase in f(x) due to the negative coefficient of t^2. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2}], making option D correct.Therefore, the correct options are boxed{BCD}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-e7ad047b data-v-ceb94754><div class="review" data-v-ceb94754><div class="review-title" data-v-ceb94754><span class="icon" data-v-ceb94754>❓:</span>Define that for two quantities A and B, if A and B have the same range of values, then A and B can be interchanged.

I need to make sure I understand what&#39;s being asked in each part and then work through the logic carefully. Let&#39;s start with part (1).Problem (1): We have a quadratic function f(x) = x² + b x + c defined for all integers x. It&#39;s given that for any integer x, f(x) is always greater than or equal to f(0). We need to determine whether the quantities a and b can be interchanged, where a = sinθ with θ in the interval [-π/2, π/2].First, let me recall the definition provided: two quantities A and B can be interchanged if they have the same range of values. So, I need to find the range of possible values for a and for b, and check if these ranges are the same.Let&#39;s start with quantity a. Since a = sinθ and θ is in [-π/2, π/2], the sine function here ranges from sin(-π/2) = -1 to sin(π/2) = 1. Therefore, the range of a is [-1, 1]. So, a can take any real value between -1 and 1, inclusive.Now, let&#39;s consider quantity b. But wait, b is a coefficient in the quadratic function f(x) = x² + b x + c. However, the problem states that for any integer x, f(x) ≥ f(0). Let&#39;s parse this condition. First, compute f(0): f(0) = 0² + b*0 + c = c. Therefore, the condition is that for all integers x, x² + b x + c ≥ c. Subtracting c from both sides, we get x² + b x ≥ 0 for all integers x.So, the problem reduces to finding all real numbers b such that x² + b x ≥ 0 for all integers x. Wait, but x is an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero. So, we need x² + b x ≥ 0 for x ∈ ℤ.Let me analyze this inequality. Let&#39;s consider x ≠ 0, since for x = 0, the inequality is 0 + 0 ≥ 0, which is true. So, we need to ensure that for all non-zero integers x, x² + b x ≥ 0.Let&#39;s rewrite the inequality as x² ≥ -b x. For x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by |x|, but since x can be positive or negative, let&#39;s consider cases.Case 1: x &gt; 0. Then, dividing both sides by x (which is positive, so inequality direction remains), we get x ≥ -b. Therefore, for all positive integers x, x ≥ -b. Since x can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), the smallest x is 1. Therefore, to satisfy 1 ≥ -b, which implies b ≥ -1.Case 2: x &lt; 0. Let x = -n where n is a positive integer. Then, the inequality becomes (-n)² + b*(-n) ≥ 0 =&gt; n² - b n ≥ 0. Then, n² ≥ b n. Since n is positive, divide both sides by n: n ≥ b. So, for all positive integers n, n ≥ b. The smallest n is 1, so this implies 1 ≥ b, hence b ≤ 1.Therefore, combining both cases, we have b must satisfy -1 ≤ b ≤ 1. Therefore, the range of b is the interval [-1, 1].Wait, but a has range [-1, 1], and b also has range [-1, 1]. Therefore, according to the problem&#39;s definition, since their ranges are the same, a and b can be interchanged. So the answer to part (1) should be yes, they can be interchanged.But let me double-check. The problem statement says &quot;if A and B have the same range of values, then A and B can be interchanged.&quot; So, it&#39;s a definition. Since a and b both have range [-1,1], they can be interchanged. Therefore, the answer is yes.Wait, but let me make sure there&#39;s no hidden detail here. The definition says &quot;if A and B have the same range of values, then A and B can be interchanged.&quot; So, it&#39;s a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. So, if they have the same range, they can be interchanged. So since a and b both have range [-1,1], they can be interchanged. Therefore, the answer for part (1) is yes.Moving on to part (2):Problem (2):Given the function f(x) = (x² + k x + 1)/(x² + x + 1) for x &gt; 0. For any positive numbers a, b, c, the values f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle. Also, given g(x) = 2^x - 3/2 with x ∈ [m, n]. If k and g(x) can be interchanged, find m + n.First, let&#39;s parse the problem. We need to find the value of m + n where g(x) has the same range as k, given that k is such that f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the sides of a triangle for any positive a, b, c. Then, since k and g(x) can be interchanged, their ranges are the same, so we need to find the range of k, then set the range of g(x) to be the same, and thus find m and n such that 2^x - 3/2 covers that range. Then, m + n is the sum of the endpoints of the domain.So, steps:1. Find the range of k such that for any positive a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the sides of a triangle.2. Then, find the range of g(x) = 2^x - 3/2, which is [2^m - 3/2, 2^n - 3/2]. Since k and g(x) can be interchanged, their ranges must be the same. Therefore, set [2^m - 3/2, 2^n - 3/2] equal to the range of k found in step 1. Then solve for m and n, and compute m + n.So, first, step 1: determine the range of k such that for any positive a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the sides of a triangle.To form a triangle, the three sides must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Since a, b, c are arbitrary positive numbers, their images under f must satisfy that for any three values f(a), f(b), f(c), the triangle inequalities hold.But since a, b, c are arbitrary positive numbers, this means that the image of f(x) must be such that any three elements from its range satisfy the triangle inequalities. However, since a, b, c can be any positive numbers, f(x) must have a range where any three elements (allowing repetition) can form a triangle. Wait, but the problem states &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle.&quot; So, f(a), f(b), f(c) must satisfy the triangle inequalities for all a, b, c &gt; 0. Therefore, the range of f must be such that any three elements (with possible repetition) from it satisfy the triangle inequalities.But this is quite restrictive. For the triangle inequalities to hold for any three elements, the range of f must be within an interval where the sum of the two smallest elements is greater than the largest element. However, since a, b, c can be arbitrary, the function f(x) must have its range in an interval where the maximum value is less than twice the minimum value. Wait, let&#39;s think carefully.Suppose the range of f(x) is [L, M]. Then, for any three values f(a), f(b), f(c), they must satisfy that the sum of any two is greater than the third. The most restrictive case is when we take the two smallest values and check if their sum is greater than the largest value, but since a, b, c can be arbitrary, the maximum value could be as large as M and the minimum as small as L, so we need that L + L &gt; M. Because if you have two sides equal to L and one equal to M, then to have L + L &gt; M. Similarly, you also need that L + M &gt; M (which simplifies to L &gt; 0) and M + M &gt; M (which is trivial as M &gt; 0). So, the key inequality here is 2L &gt; M. Because if 2L &gt; M, then for any three values in [L, M], the sum of the two smallest will be at least L + L = 2L &gt; M, which is greater than the largest possible value M. Therefore, the condition reduces to 2L ≥ M, but strictly greater. However, since the problem allows forming the sides of a triangle, which requires strict inequalities. But in mathematical terms, sometimes triangle inequality is considered as non-strict (for degenerate triangles), but in the context of forming a triangle, it&#39;s usually strict. However, the problem says &quot;can form the three sides of a triangle,&quot; which would require strict inequalities. Therefore, we need 2L &gt; M.But first, let&#39;s find the range of f(x). The function is f(x) = (x² + k x + 1)/(x² + x + 1) for x &gt; 0.We can analyze this function to find its maximum and minimum values. Let me denote f(x) as:f(x) = [x² + k x + 1] / [x² + x + 1]Let me rewrite this as:f(x) = 1 + [(k - 1)x] / [x² + x + 1]Because:[x² + kx + 1] = [x² + x + 1] + (k - 1)xTherefore, f(x) = 1 + [(k - 1)x] / (x² + x + 1)So, to analyze the range of f(x), we can consider the term [(k - 1)x] / (x² + x + 1). Let me denote t(x) = [(k - 1)x] / (x² + x + 1). Therefore, f(x) = 1 + t(x).Therefore, the range of f(x) is 1 + range of t(x). So, we need to find the range of t(x) for x &gt; 0.First, let&#39;s consider different cases for k.Case 1: k = 1. Then t(x) = 0, so f(x) = 1 for all x. Then, the range is {1}. In this case, all f(a), f(b), f(c) are 1, so trying to form a triangle with sides 1,1,1, which is possible. However, the problem states &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c,&quot; so even if the function is constant, it&#39;s allowed. But in this case, the range is a single value. But a triangle with all sides equal is valid, so maybe k=1 is allowed. But we need to check the general case.But the problem says &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c&quot;, so even if the function is constant, as long as the three copies can form a triangle, which they can. However, in the problem statement, we need to find the values of k such that for any a, b, c &gt; 0, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form a triangle. So, if k=1, then f(x)=1 for all x, so f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=1, which can form a triangle. So, k=1 is allowed.But if k ≠ 1, then f(x) is not constant. Let&#39;s suppose k ≠ 1. Then, the function t(x) is non-zero. Let&#39;s analyze t(x):t(x) = (k - 1)x / (x² + x + 1)Let me compute the derivative of t(x) to find its extrema.First, set h(x) = (k - 1)x / (x² + x + 1). Let&#39;s compute h&#39;(x):h&#39;(x) = [(k - 1)(x² + x + 1) - (k - 1)x(2x + 1)] / (x² + x + 1)^2Simplify numerator:(k - 1)[x² + x + 1 - x(2x + 1)] = (k - 1)[x² + x + 1 - 2x² - x] = (k - 1)[-x² + 1]Therefore, h&#39;(x) = (k - 1)(-x² + 1) / (x² + x + 1)^2Set h&#39;(x) = 0:(k - 1)(-x² + 1) = 0Solutions are when either k=1 (but we already considered that case) or when -x² +1=0 =&gt; x²=1 =&gt; x=1 (since x &gt; 0).Therefore, the critical point is at x=1. So, the maximum or minimum of t(x) occurs at x=1. Let&#39;s compute t(1):t(1) = (k - 1)(1) / (1 + 1 + 1) = (k - 1)/3Now, we need to check the behavior of t(x) as x approaches 0+ and as x approaches infinity.As x approaches 0+:t(x) = (k - 1)x / (0 + 0 + 1) = (k - 1)x → 0As x approaches infinity:t(x) ≈ (k - 1)x / x² = (k - 1)/x → 0Therefore, the function t(x) approaches 0 at both ends and has a critical point at x=1. Therefore, the maximum or minimum of t(x) is at x=1.Now, depending on the value of (k - 1), the sign of t(x) will change.If k - 1 &gt; 0 (i.e., k &gt; 1), then t(x) is positive for x &gt; 0, and the critical point at x=1 is a maximum or minimum?Wait, let&#39;s look at the derivative. For k ≠ 1:The derivative h&#39;(x) = (k - 1)(-x² +1)/denominator.At x=1, the derivative is zero, and around x=1, the sign of h&#39;(x) changes.If k &gt; 1:Then, (k - 1) is positive. Let&#39;s analyze the sign of h&#39;(x):For x &lt; 1: -x² + 1 &gt; 0, so h&#39;(x) is positive.For x &gt; 1: -x² +1 &lt; 0, so h&#39;(x) is negative.Therefore, when k &gt; 1, t(x) increases up to x=1, then decreases after x=1. Therefore, x=1 is a maximum. So, the maximum value of t(x) is t(1) = (k -1)/3, and the minimum is 0 (approached as x approaches 0 or infinity).Similarly, if k &lt; 1:Then, (k - 1) is negative. The derivative h&#39;(x):For x &lt;1: -x² +1 &gt;0, so h&#39;(x) = negative * positive = negative.For x &gt;1: -x² +1 &lt;0, so h&#39;(x) = negative * negative = positive.Therefore, t(x) decreases up to x=1, then increases after x=1. Therefore, x=1 is a minimum. So, the minimum value of t(x) is (k -1)/3, and the maximum approaches 0 as x approaches 0 or infinity.Therefore, summarizing:- If k &gt; 1: t(x) has maximum (k -1)/3 at x=1, and tends to 0 at 0 and infinity. Therefore, the range of t(x) is [0, (k -1)/3]. Hence, the range of f(x) = 1 + t(x) is [1, 1 + (k -1)/3] = [1, (k + 2)/3].- If k &lt; 1: t(x) has minimum (k -1)/3 at x=1, and tends to 0 at 0 and infinity. Therefore, the range of t(x) is [(k -1)/3, 0]. Hence, the range of f(x) is [1 + (k -1)/3, 1].- If k = 1: t(x) = 0, so f(x) = 1.Therefore, the range of f(x) is:- For k &gt; 1: [1, (k + 2)/3]- For k &lt; 1: [1 + (k -1)/3, 1]- For k =1: {1}Now, returning to the problem: For any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the sides of a triangle. As discussed earlier, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the range of f(x) satisfies 2L &gt; M, where L is the minimum value and M is the maximum value of f(x). Because if this holds, then any three values from the range will satisfy the triangle inequality.But let&#39;s check this.First, when k &gt;1:The range is [1, (k + 2)/3]. So L =1, M=(k + 2)/3. The condition is 2L &gt; M =&gt; 2*1 &gt; (k + 2)/3 =&gt; 2 &gt; (k + 2)/3 =&gt; 6 &gt; k + 2 =&gt; k &lt; 4.But since k &gt;1 in this case, combining both conditions, we have 1 &lt; k &lt; 4.Similarly, when k &lt;1:The range is [1 + (k -1)/3, 1]. So L =1 + (k -1)/3, M=1. The condition is 2L &gt; M =&gt; 2*(1 + (k -1)/3) &gt;1.Compute:2 + 2*(k -1)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; 2 + (2k -2)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; Multiply both sides by 3:6 + 2k -2 &gt;3 =&gt; 4 + 2k &gt;3 =&gt; 2k &gt; -1 =&gt; k &gt; -0.5But since in this case k &lt;1, so combining, -0.5 &lt;k &lt;1.When k =1:The range is {1}, so the only value is 1. Then, 2L =2*1=2 &gt;1= M, which holds. So k=1 is allowed.Therefore, combining all the cases, the permissible values of k are -0.5 &lt;k &lt;4. However, need to check endpoints.Wait, the problem states &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle.&quot; The triangle inequalities are strict: sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, when k approaches 4 from below, the maximum value M approaches (4 +2)/3 = 2, and 2L =2*1=2. So, when k=4, M=2, and 2L=2, so 2L = M. But in that case, if we have three values where two are L=1 and one is M=2, then 1 +1 =2, which would be a degenerate triangle, not a valid triangle. Since the problem requires forming the sides of a triangle (which I assume must be non-degenerate), then k must be strictly less than 4 and strictly greater than -0.5.But the problem statement might allow degenerate triangles. However, in standard triangle definitions, degenerate triangles (where the sum is equal) are not considered valid triangles. Therefore, we need strict inequalities. Therefore, the permissible range of k is (-0.5, 4). However, let&#39;s check the case when k=4. Then f(x) has range [1, 2]. Then, taking a=1, b=1, c approaching infinity, f(c) approaches (c² +4c +1)/(c² +c +1) which approaches 1. So, as c becomes large, f(c) approaches 1. Therefore, f(a)=2, f(b)=1, f(c)=1. Then, 1 +1=2, which is equal, so degenerate. But for any a,b,c, including a approaching the critical point. However, the problem states &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c&quot;. So, if there exists a single triplet a,b,c where f(a), f(b), f(c) do not form a triangle, then k=4 is invalid. Therefore, k must be less than 4. Similarly, when k approaches -0.5 from above, the lower bound L approaches 1 + (-0.5 -1)/3 =1 -1.5/3=1 -0.5=0.5. Then, 2L=1.0, and M=1. So again, approaching equality.Therefore, the permissible range for k is (-0.5, 4). Therefore, k ∈ (-0.5, 4). However, since k is a real number, this is an open interval. But let&#39;s check the problem statement again. It says &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c&quot;, which means the condition must hold for all triples. Therefore, k must lie in (-0.5, 4). However, the problem might consider closed intervals if the endpoints are achievable without violating the triangle inequality. However, as discussed, at k=-0.5 and k=4, there exist triples a,b,c such that f(a), f(b), f(c) would form a degenerate triangle, which is invalid. Therefore, k must be strictly between -0.5 and 4. However, the problem might expect a closed interval if they allow non-strict inequalities. But given that triangle sides must satisfy strict inequalities, I think k is in (-0.5, 4).But let me verify with an example. Suppose k=4. Then, f(x) = (x² +4x +1)/(x² +x +1). Let&#39;s compute f(1):f(1) = (1 +4 +1)/(1 +1 +1)=6/3=2.As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches 1. So, if we take a=1, b=1, c=1, then f(a)=2, f(b)=2, f(c)=2: valid triangle. If we take a=1, b approaching infinity, c approaching infinity, then f(a)=2, f(b)≈1, f(c)≈1. So, 1 +1=2, which is a degenerate triangle. Since the problem states &quot;can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;, and degenerate triangles are not considered valid, then k=4 is invalid. Similarly, if k=-0.5, then the lower bound is 0.5, and upper bound 1. Then, taking a=1, f(a)=1, and x such that f(x)=0.5. Let&#39;s compute f(x)=0.5 when k=-0.5:0.5 = (x² -0.5x +1)/(x² +x +1)Multiply both sides by denominator:0.5(x² +x +1) = x² -0.5x +10.5x² +0.5x +0.5 = x² -0.5x +1Bring all terms to left:0.5x² +0.5x +0.5 -x² +0.5x -1 =0-0.5x² +1x -0.5 =0Multiply both sides by -2:x² -2x +1=0 =&gt; (x-1)^2=0 =&gt; x=1Therefore, when k=-0.5, f(1)=0.5. So, if we take a=1, b=1, c=1, then f(a)=0.5, f(b)=0.5, f(c)=0.5: valid triangle. However, if we take a=1, b=1, and x approaching infinity (so f(x) approaching 1), then f(a)=0.5, f(b)=0.5, f(c)=1. Then, 0.5 +0.5 =1, which is a degenerate triangle. Therefore, even at k=-0.5, we have a degenerate case. Therefore, k must be strictly greater than -0.5 and strictly less than 4.Therefore, the range of k is the open interval (-0.5, 4).Now, moving to step 2: Given that g(x) = 2^x - 3/2, x ∈ [m, n], and k and g(x) can be interchanged, which means their ranges are the same. So, the range of k is (-0.5, 4), so the range of g(x) must also be (-0.5, 4). So, we need to find m and n such that 2^x - 3/2 has range (-0.5, 4).But wait, 2^x is an exponential function. Let&#39;s analyze g(x):g(x) = 2^x - 3/2We need to find the domain [m, n] such that the range of g is (-0.5, 4). Let&#39;s set up equations.The function 2^x is continuous and strictly increasing. Therefore, g(x) is also strictly increasing. Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) is 2^m - 3/2, and the maximum value is 2^n - 3/2. We need:2^m - 3/2 = -0.52^n - 3/2 = 4Solve for m and n.First equation:2^m - 3/2 = -0.5Add 3/2 to both sides:2^m = -0.5 + 3/2 = 1.0So, 2^m =1 =&gt; m=0Second equation:2^n - 3/2 =4Add 3/2 to both sides:2^n =4 + 3/2 =5.5=11/2Take logarithm base 2:n = log2(11/2)= log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11) -1≈3.459 -1=2.459But exact value is log2(11/2). However, since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, we need to see if 11/2 is a power of 2, but 11 is prime, so 11/2 is not a power of 2. Therefore, we might need to leave it in terms of logarithms. But the question asks for m +n. Since m=0, n=log2(11/2). Therefore, m +n=0 + log2(11/2)= log2(11) -1. But the problem may want an exact form, but perhaps expressed as log2(11) -1, or maybe as a simplified logarithm. Alternatively, if there&#39;s a miscalculation.Wait, let&#39;s double-check the equations.Given that the range of g(x) is (-0.5, 4). Since g(x) is strictly increasing, the lower bound is achieved at x=m, and upper bound at x=n.So:g(m) =2^m -3/2= -0.5So, 2^m= -0.5 +3/2=1 =&gt; m=0.Similarly, g(n)=2^n -3/2=4 =&gt;2^n=5.5 =&gt;n=log2(11/2).But 11/2 is 5.5, which is 11 divided by 2. So, log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11) -1. Therefore, n=log2(11) -1.Hence, m +n=0 + log2(11) -1=log2(11) -1.But the problem asks for the value of m +n. Is there a way to express this in terms of exact values? log2(11) is irrational, so unless the problem expects an exact logarithmic expression or a decimal approximation, but in the context of a competition problem, it&#39;s more likely to expect an exact form. However, looking back at the problem statement: it says &quot;find the value of m +n&quot;. In some problems, even if the answer involves logarithms, it&#39;s acceptable. However, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, hold on. Let me check my reasoning again. The range of k is (-0.5,4). Therefore, the range of g(x) must also be (-0.5,4). Therefore, solving 2^m -3/2 = -0.5 gives m=0. Solving 2^n -3/2 =4 gives 2^n=5.5=11/2, so n=log2(11/2). Therefore, m +n=0 + log2(11/2)=log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11)-1. But the problem says &quot;find the value of m +n&quot;. Maybe there&#39;s an error in assuming that the range of k is open interval (-0.5,4). If the problem considers closed intervals, then the endpoints would be included. Let&#39;s re-examine the problem statement for part (2):&quot;Given f(x)= (x² +k x +1)/(x² +x +1) (x &gt;0) for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle, and g(x)=2^{x} - 3/2, x∈[m,n], if k and g(x) can be interchanged, find the value of m +n.&quot;Wait, the problem says &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. If the range of f(x) is [L, M], then for the triangle inequalities to hold for any a, b, c, we must have 2L &gt; M. But in our previous analysis, with k in (-0.5,4), we get open intervals. However, if k is allowed to be -0.5 or 4, then the range becomes closed intervals [0.5,1] or [1,2], but as we saw, at these endpoints, there exist triples a,b,c that make degenerate triangles. So, the problem might consider that even though at endpoints there are degenerate triangles, but since a,b,c are &quot;positive numbers&quot;, maybe allowing a,b,c to be equal or something? Wait, but even with a,b,c being equal, if the triangle is degenerate, then it&#39;s not considered a valid triangle. Therefore, the range for k should indeed be open interval (-0.5,4).But the function g(x)=2^x -3/2 is continuous and strictly increasing. Therefore, if we take x in [m,n], then the range of g(x) is [2^m -3/2, 2^n -3/2]. If the problem requires that the range of g(x) is exactly the same as the range of k, which is (-0.5,4), then we need the interval ( -0.5,4 ). However, since g(x) is continuous, the image of the closed interval [m,n] under g will be a closed interval [g(m),g(n)]. Therefore, to have the range of g(x) be the open interval (-0.5,4), we need to approach the endpoints but not include them. Therefore, technically, m and n would be the values such that 2^m -3/2 approaches -0.5 from above and 2^n -3/2 approaches4 from below. But in reality, for the image to be the open interval, m and n would have to be -infinity and log2(11/2), but that doesn&#39;t make sense. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem interpretation.Wait, the problem says &quot;if k and g(x) can be interchanged&quot;. The definition states that two quantities can be interchanged if they have the same range of values. The term &quot;range of values&quot; might refer to the set of all possible values they can take. If k is in (-0.5,4), and g(x) has range [g(m),g(n)], then to have the same range, we need [g(m),g(n)] = (-0.5,4). However, since g(x) is continuous over [m,n], its range is a closed interval. But (-0.5,4) is an open interval. Therefore, there is a discrepancy here. Therefore, perhaps the problem allows closed intervals, considering that endpoints can be included. If we accept that the range of k is the closed interval [-0.5,4], then even though at the endpoints there exist degenerate triangles, but maybe the problem allows that. Then, the range of k would be [-0.5,4], and the range of g(x) is [g(m),g(n)] = [-0.5,4]. Hence, solving 2^m -3/2 = -0.5 and 2^n -3/2=4, leading to m=0 and n=log2(11/2). Then, m +n=0 + log2(11/2)=log2(11)-1. But this is an exact form. However, the problem might expect a numerical answer, but in the context of a math competition problem, it&#39;s more likely to want an exact expression. But maybe there&#39;s an alternative approach.Wait, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the permissible range of k. Let&#39;s re-examine the problem.We had f(x) = (x² +kx +1)/(x² +x +1). We need for all positive a,b,c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the sides of a triangle. That is, for any a,b,c &gt;0, the three numbers f(a), f(b), f(c) satisfy the triangle inequalities. The triangle inequalities require that each one is less than the sum of the other two. Which, for three numbers, say, p, q, r, it&#39;s necessary and sufficient that p + q &gt; r, p + r &gt; q, q + r &gt; p. But since the function&#39;s range is [L, M], the most restrictive condition is that the smallest two numbers add to more than the largest. Therefore, for the entire range, we need 2L &gt; M. Because if you take two instances of the smallest value and one of the largest, you need 2L &gt; M. This ensures that all combinations satisfy the triangle inequality.But if 2L &gt; M, then automatically, the other inequalities hold. For example, if p &lt;= q &lt;= r, then p + q &gt; r implies p + r &gt; q and q + r &gt; p, since r &gt; q and q &gt;= p. So, focusing on 2L &gt; M is sufficient.Therefore, the condition is 2L &gt; M.Previously, for k &gt;1: range [1, (k +2)/3], so 2*1 &gt; (k +2)/3 =&gt; k &lt;4.For k &lt;1: range [1 + (k -1)/3,1], so 2*(1 + (k -1)/3) &gt;1.Let&#39;s compute that again:2*(1 + (k -1)/3) &gt;1 =&gt; 2 + 2*(k -1)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; 2 + (2k -2)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; Multiply both sides by3:6 +2k -2 &gt;3 =&gt; 4 +2k &gt;3 =&gt;2k &gt; -1 =&gt;k&gt; -0.5.Therefore, combining:For k &gt;1: k &lt;4For k &lt;1: k &gt; -0.5And k=1 is allowed because the range is {1}, and 2*1 &gt;1 holds.Therefore, combining all, k ∈ (-0.5,4). However, when k approaches -0.5 from above, the lower bound L approaches 0.5 and upper bound M approaches1, so 2*0.5=1, which equals M. Similarly, when k approaches4 from below, L=1 and M approaches 2, so 2*1=2=M. Therefore, if we include k=-0.5 and k=4, we get 2L = M, which allows degenerate triangles. But the problem says &quot;can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. If degenerate triangles are not allowed, then k must be in (-0.5,4). If they are allowed, then k is in [-0.5,4]. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.Assuming that the problem allows degenerate triangles (since sometimes problems do), then the range of k would be [-0.5,4]. Then, the range of g(x)=2^x -3/2 must be [-0.5,4]. Since g(x) is continuous and strictly increasing, the domain [m,n] must satisfy:g(m) =2^m -3/2 = -0.5 =&gt;2^m=1 =&gt;m=0g(n)=2^n -3/2=4 =&gt;2^n=5.5 =&gt;n=log2(11/2)Therefore, m +n=0 + log2(11/2)=log2(11)-1.But the problem is presented in Chinese, and the user translated it, so maybe there&#39;s a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe my analysis of the range of k is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the range of k is what it is. Let me verify this with specific values.Take k=-0.5. Then f(x)=(x² -0.5x +1)/(x² +x +1). Compute f(1)=(1 -0.5 +1)/(1 +1 +1)=1.5/3=0.5. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches1. So, the range is [0.5,1]. Now, if we take three values 0.5,0.5,1. Then, 0.5 +0.5=1, which is a degenerate triangle. Hence, k=-0.5 is invalid if degenerate triangles are not allowed.Similarly, for k=4, f(x)=(x² +4x +1)/(x² +x +1). At x=1, f(1)=(1 +4 +1)/(1 +1 +1)=6/3=2. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches1. So, the range is [1,2]. Taking three values 1,1,2, we get a degenerate triangle. Hence, k=4 is invalid.Therefore, strictly, k must be in (-0.5,4). However, if the problem requires the range of k to be this open interval, then the range of g(x)=2^x -3/2 must also be (-0.5,4). However, since g(x) is continuous over a closed interval [m,n], its range is a closed interval. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for the range of g(x) to be an open interval. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction here, suggesting that either the problem expects closed intervals (allowing degenerate triangles) or there&#39;s a different interpretation.Alternatively, maybe the problem&#39;s definition of &quot;interchangeable&quot; allows for open and closed intervals to be considered the same, but mathematically, open and closed intervals are different. However, given the problem&#39;s example in part (1), where f(x)=x+1 on [0,1] and g(x)=2x-1 on [1,3/2], which have ranges [1,2] and [1,2], so closed intervals. Hence, the problem likely considers closed intervals. Therefore, if we accept that the range of k is [-0.5,4], then the range of g(x) must be [-0.5,4], which is achieved by m=0 and n=log2(11/2), hence m +n= log2(11/2). But the problem asks for m +n. Unless there&#39;s an error in transcription or my analysis.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the range of k. Let me check again.For k &gt;1:The maximum value of f(x) is (k +2)/3. We need 2L &gt; M =&gt; 2*1 &gt; (k +2)/3 =&gt;k &lt;4. So the maximum k can be is approaching4 from below, so M approaching2. So, k ∈ (1,4).For k &lt;1:The minimum value of f(x) is1 + (k -1)/3. We need 2*(1 + (k -1)/3) &gt;1.Computing:2 + (2k -2)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; (6 +2k -2)/3 &gt;1 =&gt; (2k +4)/3 &gt;1 =&gt;2k +4 &gt;3 =&gt;2k &gt;-1 =&gt;k &gt;-0.5. So k ∈ (-0.5,1).For k=1, f(x)=1, so 2*1=2 &gt;1, which holds. So, combining, k ∈ (-0.5,4). Open interval.But since g(x) has a closed interval range, there is a contradiction. Therefore, the problem might have a different condition. Let me check the problem statement again.The problem states: &quot;f(x)= (x² +kx +1)/(x² +x +1)(x &gt;0) for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle, and g(x)=2^{x} - 3/2, x∈[m,n], if k and g(x) can be interchanged, find the value of m +n.&quot;The key is that &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. This is equivalent to saying that the image of f is such that any three numbers from it can form a triangle. However, if the image is an interval [L, M], then any three numbers from it must satisfy the triangle inequalities. For this to hold, it&#39;s necessary and sufficient that 2L &gt; M, as previously established. However, in that case, even if the interval is open or closed, 2L &gt; M is the key. For example, if L=0.5 and M=1 (closed interval), then 2*0.5=1=M, which fails. Hence, the interval must be such that 2L &gt; M. Therefore, even if the interval is closed, we still need 2L &gt; M. Therefore, the range of k must be such that when k is in [-0.5,4], but adjusted to satisfy 2L &gt; M. However, this leads us back to the open interval.This suggests a problem in the problem statement&#39;s requirements. Given that, perhaps the answer expects the closed interval [-0.5,4], hence m +n=log2(11/2) +0= log2(11) -1. But how is this presented?Wait, the problem says &quot;three sides of a triangle&quot;. In geometry, a triangle requires strict inequalities. Hence, the range must satisfy 2L &gt; M. Therefore, k must lie in (-0.5,4). However, the function g(x)=2^x -3/2 can only achieve a closed interval. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake, or perhaps I&#39;m missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the range of k is actually [ -0.5,4 ], and the degenerate cases are allowed, in which case the answer would require m=0 and n=log2(11/2), so m +n= log2(11/2). However, the problem might want an exact answer, and 11/2 is 5.5, so log2(5.5). But in terms of exact logarithm, it&#39;s log2(11) -1. Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a different approach.Let me think differently. Suppose we consider that the function f(x) has its output range within an interval where the minimal and maximal values satisfy 2*minf &gt; maxf. Then, for f(x) = (x² +kx +1)/(x² +x +1), we can denote y = x + 1/x +1, but not sure.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different way to compute the permissible k.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the three sides can form a triangle for any a, b, c, which are positive numbers. So, for f(a), f(b), f(c) to form a triangle, we need that each of them is less than the sum of the other two. So, for all a,b,c &gt;0:f(a) &lt; f(b) + f(c)f(b) &lt; f(a) + f(c)f(c) &lt; f(a) + f(b)But since a,b,c are arbitrary, this would require that for all x,y &gt;0, f(x) &lt; 2f(y). Wait, not necessarily, because a,b,c can be any permutation. But perhaps the most restrictive condition is when two of the f(a), f(b), f(c) are minimal and one is maximal, or similar.Wait, but since a,b,c are any positive numbers, the function f can take any value in its range. Therefore, the condition is equivalent to the range [L, M] of f satisfying that for any three values p,q,r in [L, M], the triangle inequalities hold. As established earlier, this requires 2L &gt; M.Therefore, regardless of open or closed intervals, 2L &gt; M must hold. Therefore, even if k is in the open interval (-0.5,4), the corresponding range of f(x) is (L, M) where 2L &gt; M. However, the function g(x)=2^x -3/2 is continuous and maps [m,n] to [g(m),g(n)]. Therefore, to have the same range as k, which is (-0.5,4), but g(x) can only achieve a closed interval. This is a contradiction, which suggests that either the problem has an error, or my analysis is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that k can take any real value in the closed interval [-0.5,4], and similarly, g(x) must take values in the same closed interval. Therefore, even if at the endpoints there are degenerate triangles, but the problem allows that. In that case, the range of k is [-0.5,4], and the range of g(x)=2^x -3/2 must be [-0.5,4]. Therefore, solving 2^m -3/2=-0.5 gives m=0 and 2^n -3/2=4 gives n=log2(11/2). Hence, m +n=log2(11/2)=log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11)-1.But log2(11) is irrational and approximately 3.459, so m +n≈3.459 -1=2.459. However, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of logarithm, so the answer is log2(11) -1, but how to write this?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let me compute log2(11/2):log2(11/2)=log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11) -1.But the problem might prefer the answer written as log2(11) -1, which is m +n.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a miscalculation in the range of k. Let&#39;s verify with k=-0.5 and k=4.For k=-0.5:f(x)=(x² -0.5x +1)/(x² +x +1). As x approaches0+, f(x) approaches (0 +0 +1)/(0 +0 +1)=1. At x=1, f(1)=(1 -0.5 +1)/(1 +1 +1)=1.5/3=0.5. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches1. So the range is [0.5,1].Thus, if we have three numbers in [0.5,1], then the minimal two numbers sum to at least0.5 +0.5=1, which equals the maximal number1. Therefore, degenerate triangle.For k=4:f(x)=(x² +4x +1)/(x² +x +1). At x=1, f(1)=(1 +4 +1)/3=6/3=2. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches1. So range is [1,2]. The sum of the two minimal numbers1 +1=2, which equals the maximal number2. Again, degenerate.Therefore, the permissible k must exclude these endpoints, hence open interval. However, since the function g(x) has a closed interval range, there is a disconnect. The only way this works is if the problem accepts closed intervals, thus allowing degenerate triangles, which are technically not triangles, but perhaps the problem is lenient.Given this ambiguity, but the problem&#39;s example in part(1) using closed intervals, I think the problem expects the closed interval [-0.5,4] for k, hence leading to m=0 and n=log2(11/2), so m +n=log2(11/2). Since the problem asks for the value of m +n, and in the first part the answer is simply &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but here it&#39;s numerical. However, in Chinese math problems, especially competitions, exact logarithmic forms are sometimes acceptable.Alternatively, perhaps I missed a step in analyzing the range of k. Let me think again.Suppose we let S be the range of f(x). The condition is that for any three elements p,q,r in S, p +q &gt; r.The maximum value r can take is M, and the minimum p and q can take is L. Therefore, the most restrictive case is when p=q=L and r=M. Therefore, we require 2L &gt; M.Similarly, the other inequalities are automatically satisfied if this holds.Therefore, the key condition is 2L &gt; M.In our analysis, when k ∈ (-0.5,4), we have 2L &gt; M.Therefore, the range of k is (-0.5,4), and since g(x) must have the same range, which is an open interval. However, g(x) is continuous on [m,n], which would produce a closed interval. Therefore, unless m and n are chosen such that the function approaches -0.5 and4, but never actually reaches them. However, since 2^x can take any positive value, but to approach -0.5, we need 2^x -3/2 approaches -0.5, which happens as x approaches log2(1)=0. Similarly, to approach4, 2^x -3/2 approaches4 as x approaches log2(5.5). Therefore, if we take m approaching0 from the right and n approaching log2(5.5) from the left, the range would approach (-0.5,4). However, since m and n must be real numbers, the domain is [m,n], so the best we can do is have the closed interval [-0.5,4] by setting m=0 and n=log2(5.5). Therefore, even though technically at m=0 and n=log2(5.5), the function g(x) achieves -0.5 and4, leading to degenerate triangles, but the problem might consider this acceptable.Therefore, the answer is m +n=0 + log2(11/2)=log2(11) -1.But how to write this? The problem says &quot;find the value of m +n&quot;. If it expects a numerical value, then approximately log2(11) is about 3.459, so 3.459 -1=2.459, so approximately2.46. But since it&#39;s a math competition problem, the answer is likely exact. Therefore, the answer is log2(11) -1, which can be written as log2(11) - log2(2)=log2(11/2). So, m +n=log2(11/2).But the problem might want it expressed differently. Alternatively, there&#39;s a mistake in the problem or my solution. But given the steps, I think this is the answer.Final Answer(1) boxed{Yes}(2) boxed{log_2 frac{11}{2}}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problems, we need to determine if certain quantities can be interchanged based on their ranges and find the value of ( m + n ) for a given function interchange. Part (1)Problem Analysis:- Function ( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c ) for ( x in mathbb{Z} ) always has ( f(x) geq f(0) ). This implies ( x^2 + bx geq 0 ) for all integers ( x ).- Range of ( b ) is derived by ensuring ( x^2 + bx geq 0 ) for all integers ( x ). This results in ( -1 leq b leq 1 ).- Quantity ( a = sin theta ) for ( theta in [-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}] ) has the range ( [-1, 1] ).Conclusion:Both ( a ) and ( b ) have the range ( [-1, 1] ), so they can be interchanged. Part (2)Problem Analysis:- Function ( f(x) = frac{x^2 + kx + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} ) for ( x &gt; 0 ) must have values that can form the sides of a triangle for any positive ( a, b, c ). This requires the range of ( f(x) ) to satisfy ( 2L &gt; M ) where ( L ) and ( M ) are the minimum and maximum values of ( f(x) ).- Range of ( k ) is found by analyzing the function&#39;s critical points and behavior, leading to ( -0.5 &lt; k &lt; 4 ).- Function ( g(x) = 2^x - frac{3}{2} ) must have the same range as ( k ). Solving ( 2^m - frac{3}{2} = -0.5 ) and ( 2^n - frac{3}{2} = 4 ) gives ( m = 0 ) and ( n = log_2 frac{11}{2} ).Conclusion:The value of ( m + n ) is ( log_2 frac{11}{2} ). Final Answers(1) boxed{Yes}(2) boxed{log_2 frac{11}{2}},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have two parts to solve here. Let me start with part (1). The problem says that for quantities A and B, if they have the same range of values, they can be interchanged. Then, in part (1), we&#39;re given a quadratic function f(x) = x² + bx + c defined for any integer x (so x is in ℤ), and it&#39;s stated that this function always has f(x) ≥ f(0). Then, a is defined as sinθ where θ is in [-π/2, π/2]. We need to judge whether a and b can be interchanged, meaning whether their ranges are the same.First, let&#39;s tackle the quadratic function. Since x is an integer, f(x) must be minimized at x=0. So, the minimum value of f(x) for x ∈ ℤ is f(0). Let&#39;s recall that for a quadratic function f(x) = x² + bx + c, the vertex occurs at x = -b/(2). But since x must be an integer, the minimum might not necessarily be at the vertex unless the vertex is at an integer x. However, the problem states that f(x) is always ≥ f(0) for any integer x. That means that x=0 is the point where the quadratic function attains its minimum over the integers. So, for f(x) to have its minimum at x=0 over the integers, the vertex of the parabola should be such that x=0 is the closest integer to the vertex, or the vertex is at x=0. Let&#39;s compute the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/2. So, if the vertex is at x = -b/2, then we need to ensure that for all integers x, f(x) ≥ f(0). This would require that the vertex is at x=0, or that the vertex is between x=-0.5 and x=0.5, so that the closest integer to the vertex is 0. If the vertex is outside this interval, then the minimum might occur at x=-1 or x=1, which would contradict the given condition. Therefore, the vertex must lie in the interval [-0.5, 0.5]. So, -b/2 ∈ [-0.5, 0.5]. Multiplying all parts by 2, we get -1 ≤ -b ≤ 1, which is equivalent to -1 ≤ -b ≤ 1. Adding b to all parts, we get -1 + b ≤ 0 ≤ 1 + b. Hmm, maybe another approach.Wait, if the vertex is at x = -b/2, and it must lie in [-0.5, 0.5], then:-0.5 ≤ -b/2 ≤ 0.5Multiply all parts by 2:-1 ≤ -b ≤ 1Multiply by -1 (and reverse inequalities):1 ≥ b ≥ -1So, b ∈ [-1, 1]. Therefore, the possible values of b are between -1 and 1. But since b is a coefficient in the quadratic function, which is presumably a real number, unless specified otherwise. So, the range of b is the interval [-1, 1].Now, a is defined as sinθ where θ ∈ [-π/2, π/2]. The range of sinθ over this interval is [-1, 1], since sin(-π/2) = -1 and sin(π/2) = 1, and sin is continuous and increasing in this interval. Therefore, the range of a is [-1, 1].But wait, the problem states that a and b can be interchanged if they have the same range of values. Since both a and b have the range [-1, 1], then according to the definition, they can be interchanged. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is yes, they can be interchanged.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The problem says &quot;for two quantities A and B, if A and B have the same range of values, then A and B can be interchanged.&quot; So, if a and b have the same range, which is [-1,1], then they can be interchanged. So, unless there&#39;s some mistake in my reasoning.But wait, in part (1), the quadratic function f(x) is defined for x ∈ ℤ. The coefficients b and c are presumably real numbers. The problem states that for any integer x, f(x) ≥ f(0). So, through the analysis, we found that b must be in [-1, 1]. So, the range of b is [-1, 1]. Then, a is sinθ, θ ∈ [-π/2, π/2], which also has range [-1, 1]. Therefore, since both a and b have the same range, they can be interchanged. So, answer is yes.Moving on to part (2). Given f(x) = (x² + kx + 1)/(x² + x + 1) for x &gt; 0. For any positive numbers a, b, c, the values f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle. We need to find the conditions on k such that this holds, and then given that k and g(x) can be interchanged, where g(x) = 2^x - 3/2 with x ∈ [m, n], find m + n.First, let&#39;s recall that three positive numbers can form the sides of a triangle if and only if the sum of any two is greater than the third. So, for f(a), f(b), f(c), we need that for any a, b, c &gt; 0, the three numbers f(a), f(b), f(c) satisfy the triangle inequalities: f(a) + f(b) &gt; f(c), f(a) + f(c) &gt; f(b), f(b) + f(c) &gt; f(a). But the problem states that &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. So, regardless of what a, b, c are (as long as they are positive), f(a), f(b), f(c) must satisfy the triangle inequalities. Therefore, this imposes a condition on the function f(x). Specifically, the range of f(x) must be such that the sum of the smallest two values in the range is greater than the largest value. Because if the maximum value of f(x) is less than the sum of the minimum two, then for any three elements in the range, the sum of the two smallest will exceed the largest. Alternatively, if the function&#39;s range is such that the maximum value is less than the sum of the minimum two, but since we need this to hold for any a, b, c, maybe the function f must have all its outputs lying within an interval where the maximum value is less than twice the minimum value? Wait, let&#39;s think carefully.Suppose that f(x) has a range [L, M], where L is the minimum value and M is the maximum value. Then, for any three elements f(a), f(b), f(c) in [L, M], we need that the sum of any two is greater than the third. The most restrictive case is when two sides are the smallest possible (L) and the third is the largest possible (M). Then, we need L + L &gt; M, i.e., 2L &gt; M. Similarly, we also need L + M &gt; M (which is automatically true since L &gt; 0), and similarly for other combinations. So, the key condition is 2L &gt; M.Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that twice the minimum value of f(x) is greater than the maximum value of f(x).So, first, we need to find the range of f(x) = (x² + kx + 1)/(x² + x + 1) for x &gt; 0. Then, compute its minimum and maximum, set 2L &gt; M, solve for k. Then, once k is determined, since k and g(x) can be interchanged, meaning they have the same range. Then, since g(x) = 2^x - 3/2, x ∈ [m, n], we need to find the interval [m, n] such that the range of g(x) is equal to the range of k. Then, m + n is the sum of the endpoints.So, step by step:First, find the range of f(x) for x &gt; 0. Let&#39;s compute f(x):f(x) = (x² + kx + 1)/(x² + x + 1)Let me denote denominator as D = x² + x + 1, numerator as N = x² + kx + 1.Then, f(x) can be written as:f(x) = 1 + [(k - 1)x]/DBecause N = x² + kx + 1 = (x² + x + 1) + (k - 1)x, so f(x) = 1 + (k - 1)x / D.So, f(x) = 1 + (k - 1)x / (x² + x + 1)To find the range of f(x), we can analyze this expression. Let me set y = f(x). Then,y = 1 + (k - 1)x / (x² + x + 1)Let me denote t = x &gt; 0. Then, y = 1 + (k - 1)t / (t² + t + 1)We can analyze the function h(t) = t / (t² + t + 1) for t &gt; 0. The range of h(t) will help us find the range of y.First, let&#39;s find the maximum and minimum of h(t). Take derivative of h(t):h(t) = t / (t² + t + 1)h&#39;(t) = [1*(t² + t + 1) - t*(2t + 1)] / (t² + t + 1)^2Simplify numerator:(t² + t + 1) - t*(2t + 1) = t² + t + 1 - 2t² - t = -t² + 1Therefore, h&#39;(t) = (-t² + 1) / (t² + t + 1)^2Set derivative equal to zero:-t² + 1 = 0 =&gt; t² = 1 =&gt; t = 1 (since t &gt; 0)So, the critical point is at t = 1. Let&#39;s compute h(1):h(1) = 1 / (1 + 1 + 1) = 1/3Now, check the limits as t approaches 0+ and t approaches infinity:As t → 0+, h(t) → 0 / (0 + 0 + 1) = 0As t → ∞, h(t) ≈ t / t² = 1/t → 0Therefore, the maximum of h(t) is at t = 1, h(1) = 1/3, and the minimum approaches 0. Therefore, the range of h(t) is (0, 1/3]Therefore, h(t) ∈ (0, 1/3] for t &gt; 0.Therefore, going back to y:y = 1 + (k - 1)h(t)So, if k - 1 is positive, then y ranges from 1 + 0 to 1 + (k - 1)*(1/3), i.e., (1, 1 + (k - 1)/3]If k - 1 is negative, then y ranges from 1 + (k - 1)*(1/3) to 1 + 0, i.e., [1 + (k - 1)/3, 1)If k - 1 = 0, then y = 1 for all t, so range is {1}Therefore, the range of f(x):Case 1: k &gt; 1Range is (1, 1 + (k - 1)/3] = (1, (k + 2)/3]Case 2: k &lt; 1Range is [1 + (k - 1)/3, 1) = [(k + 2)/3, 1)Case 3: k = 1Range is {1}Now, the problem states that for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle. As we established earlier, this requires that twice the minimum value of f(x) is greater than the maximum value of f(x).So, depending on the case:Case 1: k &gt; 1Range is (1, (k + 2)/3]Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, when k &gt; 1, then (k - 1) is positive, so the maximum of y is 1 + (k - 1)/3, and the minimum approaches 1 from above. Wait, but when k &gt; 1, h(t) ∈ (0, 1/3], so (k - 1)h(t) ∈ (0, (k - 1)/3], so y = 1 + (k - 1)h(t) ∈ (1, 1 + (k - 1)/3]. So, the maximum is 1 + (k - 1)/3, and the minimum approaches 1 (but doesn&#39;t reach 1). However, the problem says &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c&quot;, which can approach the limits. So, if the minimum is approached but not achieved, then the infimum is 1 and the supremum is (k + 2)/3. But in reality, for a, b, c &gt; 0, f(a) can get as close to 1 as desired, but never actually 1. Similarly, the maximum is (k + 2)/3.But since a, b, c are positive numbers, f(a) can approach 1 but not reach it. Similarly, f(a) can approach (k + 2)/3. So, in terms of the triangle inequality, we need that the sum of the two smallest possible sides exceeds the largest possible side. The smallest possible side is approaching 1, and the largest is (k + 2)/3. However, we need that for any a, b, c, the three values f(a), f(b), f(c) satisfy the triangle inequalities. But if f(a) can approach 1, then the sum of two such values approaching 1 would approach 2. The maximum value is (k + 2)/3. Therefore, to ensure that 2*1 &gt; (k + 2)/3, which would mean 2 &gt; (k + 2)/3 ⇒ 6 &gt; k + 2 ⇒ k &lt; 4.But wait, but in this case, when k &gt; 1, the range is (1, (k + 2)/3]. So, the infimum is 1, the supremum is (k + 2)/3. To satisfy the triangle inequality for any three elements in this interval, the condition is that 2*inf f(x) &gt; sup f(x). Since the infimum is 1, then 2*1 &gt; (k + 2)/3 ⇒ 2 &gt; (k + 2)/3 ⇒ 6 &gt; k + 2 ⇒ k &lt; 4. Therefore, for k &gt; 1, the condition is k &lt; 4. But since k &gt; 1, this gives 1 &lt; k &lt; 4.Similarly, for k &lt; 1, the range is [(k + 2)/3, 1). Then, the infimum is (k + 2)/3, the supremum is 1. The triangle inequality condition would be 2*(k + 2)/3 &gt; 1 ⇒ 2(k + 2)/3 &gt; 1 ⇒ 2k + 4 &gt; 3 ⇒ 2k &gt; -1 ⇒ k &gt; -1/2. Since k &lt; 1, this gives -1/2 &lt; k &lt; 1.For k = 1, the function is constant 1, so all three sides would be 1, which trivially form a triangle. So, k = 1 is allowed.Therefore, combining all these, the possible values of k are -1/2 &lt; k &lt; 4. Wait, but let&#39;s check when k = -1/2. Let&#39;s substitute k = -1/2 into the inequality for k &lt; 1. So, when k = -1/2, the infimum is ( (-1/2) + 2 ) /3 = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. Then, 2*inf = 1, and sup is 1. So, 2*inf = 1 ≥ sup =1, but the triangle inequality requires strict inequality. So, if k = -1/2, the infimum is 1/2, supremum is 1. Then, 2*(1/2) = 1, which is equal to the supremum. But the triangle inequality requires that the sum of two sides is greater than the third, not greater or equal. Therefore, k cannot be equal to -1/2. Similarly, if k approaches -1/2 from above, then 2*inf approaches 1, but sup is 1. So, we need strict inequality. Therefore, k must be greater than -1/2. Similarly, when k approaches 4 from below, 2*inf approaches 2*1 = 2, and sup approaches (4 + 2)/3 = 2. So, again, equality. Hence, k must be strictly less than 4.Therefore, the allowable values for k are (-1/2, 4). Wait, but in the case for k &lt;1, we had -1/2 &lt;k &lt;1, and for k ≥1, 1 ≤k &lt;4. So, combined, k ∈ (-1/2, 4). However, we need to confirm if this is correct.Wait, let&#39;s verify with k approaching -1/2 from above. Suppose k = -0.4. Then, infimum is (-0.4 + 2)/3 = 1.6/3 ≈ 0.533, and supremum is 1. Then 2*0.533 ≈1.066 &gt;1, which is okay. If k approaches -1/2, say k = -0.499, then infimum is (-0.499 + 2)/3 ≈1.501/3≈0.5003, then 2*0.5003≈1.0006 &gt;1, which barely holds. So as k approaches -1/2 from above, 2*inf approaches 1. So, k must be greater than -1/2.Similarly, when k approaches 4 from below, say k=3.999, then sup is (3.999 +2)/3≈5.999/3≈1.9997, and inf is approaching 1. So, 2*1=2 &gt;1.9997, which holds. But at k=4, sup=(4+2)/3=2, and 2*1=2, which is equal, so not allowed. Therefore, k must be in (-1/2, 4).Hence, the range of k is (-1/2, 4). Therefore, the possible values of k are all real numbers between -1/2 and 4, not including the endpoints.Now, the problem says that if k and g(x) can be interchanged, which means they have the same range. Given that g(x) =2^x - 3/2, x ∈ [m,n]. So, the range of g(x) is [2^m - 3/2, 2^n - 3/2], since 2^x is increasing. Therefore, to have the same range as k, which is (-1/2, 4), we need [2^m - 3/2, 2^n - 3/2] = (-1/2, 4). But note that the range of k is an open interval (-1/2, 4), but g(x) is defined on a closed interval [m, n], so the range of g(x) is a closed interval [2^m - 3/2, 2^n - 3/2]. However, the problem says &quot;if k and g(x) can be interchanged&quot;, which according to the initial definition requires that they have the same range. But k&#39;s range is an open interval, while g(x)&#39;s range is a closed interval. This seems contradictory. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake here. Wait, let me check the original problem again.Wait, in the problem statement for part (2), it says: &quot;if k and g(x) can be interchanged, find the value of m + n&quot;. So, perhaps here, even though k&#39;s range is open, but g(x) is defined over x ∈ [m, n], which gives a closed interval. But according to the initial definition, interchangeability is based on having the same range. However, open and closed intervals are different. So, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in my previous reasoning regarding the range of k. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that even if the endpoints are not achieved, but the intervals are the same in terms of closure. Wait, but in the initial example, f(x) and g(x) had ranges [0,1] and [1, 3/2], but the problem says they can be interchanged. Wait, in the example, f(x) =x+1, x∈[0,1], so range is [1,2], and g(x)=2x-1, x∈[1, 3/2], so range is [1, 2]. Therefore, both have the same closed interval [1,2], hence they can be interchanged. So, perhaps in the problem statement, ranges are considered as closed intervals if the endpoints are attainable. But in part (1), the range of a is [-1,1], which is closed, and range of b is [-1,1], so closed as well, hence interchangeable. But in part (2), if k&#39;s range is open interval (-1/2,4), but g(x) would need to have the same open interval. However, since g(x) is continuous and defined on a closed interval [m,n], its range is a closed interval. Therefore, unless the problem allows open intervals, which would require that the endpoints are not included. However, if we have to match the range exactly, including openness or closedness, then since k&#39;s range is open, and g(x)&#39;s range is closed, they cannot be interchanged. But since the problem states that they can be interchanged, perhaps the range of k is actually closed? Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Wait, let&#39;s revisit the analysis for part (2). When k is in (-1/2, 4), the range of f(x) when k is in (-1/2,1) is [(k + 2)/3, 1). When k approaches -1/2 from the right, (k + 2)/3 approaches ( (-1/2) + 2 )/3 = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. So, the range is [1/2, 1) when k approaches -1/2. However, when k is exactly -1/2, the function f(x) would have a minimum of 1/2 and maximum approaching 1, but since k=-1/2 is not allowed, the infimum is 1/2 but not achieved. Similarly, for k approaching 4 from below, the range is (1, 2), but when k=4, it would be (1, 2], but k=4 is not allowed. Therefore, the range of f(x) when k is in (-1/2,4) is (1/2, 2). Wait, this contradicts previous reasoning.Wait, no. Wait, for k in (-1/2,1), the range is [(k + 2)/3, 1). The minimum (k + 2)/3 approaches 1/2 when k approaches -1/2. So, the infimum is 1/2, but not achieved. Similarly, the supremum is 1, not achieved. For k in [1,4), the range is (1, (k + 2)/3]. When k approaches 4, the maximum approaches (4 + 2)/3 = 2. So, the supremum is approaching 2 but not achieved. Therefore, the overall range of f(x) for k in (-1/2,4) is (1/2, 2). Wait, but when k is exactly 1, the range is {1}, but that&#39;s a single point.Wait, no. Wait, when k=1, the function f(x) becomes (x² + x +1)/(x² +x +1) =1, so the range is {1}. So, for k=1, the range is {1}. However, the problem states &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. If the range is {1}, then f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=1, so 1,1,1 can form a triangle. So, k=1 is allowed. But when k approaches 1 from below or above, the ranges are intervals around 1. But in the problem statement, k is a fixed value such that for any a,b,c&gt;0, f(a),f(b),f(c) can form a triangle. Therefore, when k=1, it&#39;s allowed, but when k is near 1 but not equal, the range is an interval. However, the problem says &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c&quot;, which would include cases where a,b,c can be chosen to make f(a), f(b), f(c) approach the extremes of the range. Therefore, even if k is not 1, but in (-1/2,4), the range is an interval, but the triangle condition requires that 2*inf &gt; sup. However, when k=1, the range is a single point, so trivially satisfies the triangle condition.But if we take into account that when k=1, the range is {1}, then technically, the range is closed. However, for k ≠1, the range is an open interval. But the problem is asking for &quot;the value of k&quot; such that for any a,b,c&gt;0, f(a),f(b),f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle. So, the allowable k is [-1/2,4], because at k=-1/2 and k=4, even though the triangle inequality becomes non-strict, maybe the problem allows it? But in reality, triangles require strict inequality. So, perhaps not. However, in the problem&#39;s own example in part (1), it mentions f(x)=x+1, x∈[0,1] and g(x)=2x-1, x∈[1, 3/2], which have ranges [1,2] and [1,2], hence interchangeable. So, the problem seems to consider closed intervals. Therefore, maybe in part (2), the range of k is considered as a closed interval [-1/2,4]. But according to the analysis earlier, when k=-1/2, the range of f(x) is [1/2,1], and 2*(1/2)=1, which equals the maximum, so triangle inequality fails. Similarly, when k=4, the range is [1,2], and 2*1=2, which equals the maximum, again failing the triangle inequality. Therefore, the problem must consider k in (-1/2,4), open interval. But then the range of k is open, while the range of g(x) would be a closed interval, so they cannot be interchanged. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that k can take any value in the closed interval [-1/2,4], and g(x) is adjusted to match that. Wait, let&#39;s think again. The problem says &quot;if k and g(x) can be interchanged&quot;, meaning that their ranges are the same. So, if k is allowed to be in (-1/2,4), then the range of k is (-1/2,4), which is an open interval, and g(x)=2^x -3/2 must have the same range. But g(x) is continuous, so its range on [m,n] would be [2^m -3/2, 2^n -3/2], a closed interval. Therefore, to have the range of g(x) equal to (-1/2,4), we need 2^m -3/2 = -1/2 and 2^n -3/2 =4. However, since 2^m -3/2 =-1/2 implies 2^m =1, so m=0. Similarly, 2^n -3/2=4 implies 2^n=5.5 ⇒ n=log₂(11/2). But then the range of g(x) on [0, log₂(11/2)] is [-1/2,4], but since g(x) is continuous, the endpoints are achieved, so the range is closed [-1/2,4]. However, the range of k is open (-1/2,4). Therefore, they cannot be interchanged since one is open and the other is closed. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my analysis.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the range of k is closed [-1/2,4], assuming that the triangle inequality allows equality. However, in the triangle inequality, the sum must be greater, not greater or equal. Therefore, if the range of k were [-1/2,4], then when k=-1/2, the range of f(x) is [1/2,1], and 2*1/2=1, which is equal to the maximum, so the triangle inequality is not satisfied. Hence, k cannot be -1/2. Similarly, when k=4, the range is [1,2], and 2*1=2, which is equal to the maximum, again failing. Therefore, the problem must require k ∈ (-1/2,4). However, as mentioned, the range of g(x) would have to be an open interval, which is impossible since g(x) is continuous over a closed interval, hence its range is closed. Therefore, unless the problem is considering closure, or there&#39;s a different interpretation.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the range of k. Let me check again.Earlier, for k &lt;1, the range of f(x) is [(k + 2)/3,1). The minimum is (k + 2)/3, and the supremum is 1. For the triangle condition, we need 2*(k + 2)/3 &gt;1, which gives k &gt;-1/2. For k approaching -1/2 from above, (k + 2)/3 approaches ( (-1/2) + 2 )/3= (3/2)/3=1/2. So, 2*(1/2)=1, which is equal to the supremum. Therefore, to have strict inequality, k must be greater than -1/2. Similarly, for k &gt;1, the range is (1, (k + 2)/3], and we need 2*1 &gt; (k + 2)/3 ⇒k &lt;4. When k approaches 4, (k + 2)/3 approaches 2, so 2*1=2, which is equal. Hence, strict inequality requires k &lt;4. Therefore, the allowable k is (-1/2,4).However, the problem states that &quot;for any positive numbers a, b, c, f(a), f(b), f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle&quot;. If the range of f(x) is (1/2,2), then for any three numbers in this interval, the sum of the two smallest is greater than the largest. Wait, let&#39;s check. Take three numbers: 0.6, 0.7, 1.9. Then, 0.6 +0.7=1.3, which is less than 1.9. So, this would not form a triangle. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed.Wait, this is a problem. So, my assumption that 2L &gt; M is sufficient is incorrect. Because even if 2L &gt; M, if there are three numbers in the range where two numbers sum to less than the third, then it&#39;s invalid. So, perhaps the correct condition is that the maximum value is less than the sum of the minimum two. Wait, but if the range is [L, M], then to have any three numbers a, b, c in [L, M], the sum of the two smallest must exceed the largest. So, for any a ≤ b ≤ c in [L, M], we need a + b &gt; c.The most restrictive case is when a and b are as small as possible, and c is as large as possible. So, the minimal sum of a + b is L + L, and the maximal c is M. Therefore, the condition is 2L &gt; M. Similarly, but also, for other cases where a is small, b is medium, c is large. For example, if a = L, b = L, c = M, then 2L &gt; M. If a = L, b = M, c = M, then L + M &gt; M ⇒ L &gt;0, which is true since f(x) is positive. Similarly, all other combinations would automatically satisfy the triangle inequality if 2L &gt; M. Because for any a, b, c, suppose c is the largest. Then a + b ≥ L + L = 2L &gt; M ≥ c. Hence, a + b &gt; c. Therefore, 2L &gt; M is sufficient. However, in my previous example with 0.6,0.7,1.9, if L=0.5 and M=2, but 2L=1 &lt; M=2, so 2L &gt; M is not satisfied. Wait, no. If 2L &gt; M, then even the minimal sum 2L exceeds the maximal possible c. So, in the example above, if 2L &gt; M, then 2*0.5=1 &gt; M. But if M=2, then 1 &lt; 2, which violates the condition. Therefore, in order to have 2L &gt; M, we need that for the minimal L and maximal M, 2L &gt; M. Therefore, the range of f(x) must be such that twice the minimum value is greater than the maximum value.Therefore, in our problem, with f(x) having range depending on k:For k ∈ (-1/2,4):- When k ∈ (-1/2,1), the range is [(k + 2)/3, 1). Therefore, L = (k + 2)/3, M approaches 1. Then, 2L &gt; M requires 2*(k + 2)/3 &gt; 1 ⇒ 2k + 4 &gt; 3 ⇒ 2k &gt; -1 ⇒ k &gt; -1/2. Which aligns with our previous result.- When k ∈ [1,4), the range is (1, (k + 2)/3]. Therefore, L approaches 1, M = (k + 2)/3. Then, 2L &gt; M requires 2*1 &gt; (k + 2)/3 ⇒ k &lt;4.But in this case, if k=3, then M=(3 +2)/3=5/3≈1.666. So, 2L=2*1=2 &gt;1.666, which holds. But if you take values in the range, say 1.1,1.1,1.666. Then, 1.1 +1.1=2.2 &gt;1.666, which works. Similarly, take 1.01,1.01,1.666: sum is 2.02&gt;1.666. So, yes, it works. However, if the range was, say, up to 2 (when k=4), then 2L=2*1=2, which equals M=2. So, equality would fail. But for k&lt;4, M&lt;2, so 2&gt;M.Therefore, the condition 2L &gt; M is sufficient for the triangle inequality to hold for any three elements in the range [L, M]. Therefore, the allowable values of k are indeed (-1/2,4). However, since when k approaches -1/2 or 4, the condition 2L &gt; M approaches equality, but since k cannot be exactly -1/2 or 4, the range remains open.Therefore, the range of k is the open interval (-1/2,4). Therefore, if k and g(x) can be interchanged, meaning they have the same range, then g(x)=2^x -3/2 must have the range (-1/2,4). But since g(x) is continuous and defined on a closed interval [m,n], its range is a closed interval [2^m -3/2,2^n -3/2]. To have the range (-1/2,4), we need to exclude the endpoints. However, since g(x) is continuous, the only way to have an open interval is to have the domain as open intervals. But the problem states x ∈ [m,n], which is a closed interval. Therefore, this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe the problem is not strictly requiring open or closed, but just the interval between two values. For example, if the problem considers that the range of k is the interval from -1/2 to 4, not worrying about open or closed, then g(x) can be matched to that. In this case, even though technically the range of k is open and g(x)&#39;s range is closed, maybe the problem is overlooking this detail. Given that in the initial example, they used closed intervals, perhaps here they also consider the closed interval [-1/2,4] for k. Therefore, if we accept that, then the range of k is [-1/2,4], matching the closed interval from g(x)=2^x -3/2, which would be [2^m -3/2,2^n -3/2]. Therefore, setting 2^m -3/2=-1/2 and 2^n -3/2=4:For the lower bound: 2^m -3/2 = -1/2 ⇒ 2^m =1 ⇒ m=0.For the upper bound: 2^n -3/2=4 ⇒2^n=5.5 ⇒n=log₂(11/2)=log₂11 -1 ≈3.459 -1≈2.459.But since the problem says x ∈[m,n], then m=0 and n=log₂(11/2). Therefore, m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)=log₂(11) - log₂2= log₂11 -1. However, log₂(11/2)=log₂11 -1, so m +n= log₂11 -1 +0= log₂(11/2). Wait, no. Wait, m=0, n=log₂(11/2), so m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)= log₂11 - log₂2= log₂11 -1. But the problem might expect an exact form. Since 11/2=5.5, and log₂(5.5)= log₂(11) -1. But maybe it&#39;s better to write it in terms of log₂(11) -1.However, the problem might want an exact answer, perhaps expressed as log₂(11) -1 +0= log₂(11) -1. But usually, competition problems would expect an integer or a simple fraction. However, 11 is a prime number, so log₂(11) is irrational. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, let me check the steps again. If the range of k is [-1/2,4], which is closed, then to have the same range for g(x)=2^x -3/2, we need:Lower bound:2^m -3/2=-1/2 ⇒2^m=1 ⇒m=0Upper bound:2^n -3/2=4 ⇒2^n=5.5 ⇒n=log₂(11/2). So, n= log₂11 - log₂2= log₂11 -1.Therefore, m +n=0 + log₂11 -1= log₂11 -1.But the problem asks for the value of m +n. If it requires a numerical answer, but likely it&#39;s acceptable in terms of logarithms. However, in many math competitions, unless specified, exact form is required, so log₂(11) -1. Alternatively, since log₂(11/2) is the same as n, so m +n= log₂(11/2). But the problem may want a simplified answer. Wait, but 11/2 is 5.5, which is 11/2, so log₂(11) -1. Therefore, m +n= log₂(11) -1.But maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s think again.If the range of k is (-1/2,4), open interval, and we need g(x)=2^x -3/2 to have the same range. Since g(x) is continuous, the only way to get an open interval is to have the domain as an open interval. But the problem states x ∈[m,n], a closed interval. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, maybe the problem implicitly assumes closed intervals, overlooking the open/closed aspect. Therefore, taking the closure of k&#39;s range, [-1/2,4], and setting g(x)&#39;s range to match, which would be [-1/2,4]. Therefore, solving 2^m -3/2= -1/2 ⇒m=0, and 2^n -3/2=4 ⇒n=log₂(11/2). Then, m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)=log₂(11) - log₂2= log₂11 -1. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s an error in my analysis of the range of k.Wait, going back, if k is allowed to be in the closed interval [-1/2,4], then the range of f(x) would be:For k=-1/2, f(x) has range [1/2,1]For k=4, f(x) has range [1,2]For k=1, f(x)=1But when k is in between, the ranges are between these intervals. However, when k=-1/2, the range is [1/2,1]. Then, 2*1/2=1, which is equal to the maximum, so triangle inequality fails. Similarly, for k=4, range [1,2], 2*1=2, which is equal to maximum, again failing. Therefore, the problem must require open interval for k. But since the problem allows interchangeability between k and g(x), which would require that the ranges are the same. Therefore, if k&#39;s range is open (-1/2,4), then g(x) must also have this open range. However, as mentioned, g(x) being continuous over [m,n] has closed range. Therefore, there is a contradiction unless we consider that the problem is not strict about open/closed intervals. Given the initial example in the problem statement uses closed intervals, likely the problem expects that we consider the closed interval [-1/2,4] for k, even though strictly speaking, the triangle inequality requires open. Therefore, proceeding under the assumption that the problem expects k ∈ [-1/2,4], and hence the range of g(x) is [-1/2,4].Therefore, solving 2^m -3/2 = -1/2 and 2^n -3/2 =4:For the lower bound: 2^m -3/2 = -1/2 ⇒2^m=1⇒m=0.For the upper bound:2^n -3/2=4⇒2^n=5.5⇒n=log₂(11/2).Thus, m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)=log₂(11) - log₂2= log₂11 -1. But log₂11 is irrational. However, the problem might accept this as the answer. But the problem is in Chinese, perhaps from a competition where the answer is an integer? Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.Wait, 2^n =5.5=11/2. Therefore, n=log₂(11/2)=log₂11 - log₂2= log₂11 -1. Thus, m +n=0 + log₂11 -1= log₂11 -1. But in the problem statement, part (2) asks for &quot;the value of m +n&quot;. If this is a competition problem, perhaps the answer is log₂(22) -2 or something else, but I think not. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach to the problem where k&#39;s range is different.Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis of the range of k is incorrect. Let&#39;s re-express f(x).Given f(x) = (x² +kx +1)/(x² +x +1)Let me denote t = x + 1/x, but not sure. Alternatively, consider f(x) as a function of x&gt;0. Let me compute its derivative to find extrema.f(x) = (x² +kx +1)/(x² +x +1)f’(x) = [ (2x +k)(x² +x +1) - (x² +kx +1)(2x +1) ] / (x² +x +1)^2Simplify numerator:Let’s compute numerator:(2x +k)(x² +x +1) - (x² +kx +1)(2x +1)Expand both terms:First term: 2x(x² +x +1) +k(x² +x +1) =2x³ +2x² +2x +k x² +k x +kSecond term: (x² +k x +1)(2x +1) =x²(2x +1) +k x(2x +1) +1*(2x +1)=2x³ +x² +2k x² +k x +2x +1Therefore, numerator= [2x³ +2x² +2x +k x² +k x +k] - [2x³ +x² +2k x² +k x +2x +1]= 2x³ +2x² +2x +k x² +k x +k -2x³ -x² -2k x² -k x -2x -1Simplify term by term:2x³ -2x³ =02x² -x² -2k x² +k x²= (2 -1 -2k +k)x²= (1 -k)x²2x -2x=0k x -k x=0k -1So numerator= (1 -k)x² + (k -1)Factor out (1 -k):(1 -k)(x² -1)Therefore, f’(x)= (1 -k)(x² -1)/(x² +x +1)^2Therefore, critical points at x² -1=0 ⇒x=1 (since x&gt;0)Therefore, the derivative is zero at x=1, and the sign depends on (1 -k)(x² -1). So, for x &lt;1, x² -1 &lt;0, and for x &gt;1, x² -1 &gt;0.Therefore, if 1 -k &gt;0, i.e., k &lt;1, then:- For x &lt;1, (1 -k)(x² -1) &lt;0 ⇒f’(x) &lt;0- For x &gt;1, (1 -k)(x² -1) &gt;0 ⇒f’(x) &gt;0Therefore, when k &lt;1, f(x) has a minimum at x=1.If k &gt;1, then 1 -k &lt;0, so:- For x &lt;1, (1 -k)(x² -1) &gt;0 ⇒f’(x) &gt;0- For x &gt;1, (1 -k)(x² -1) &lt;0 ⇒f’(x) &lt;0Therefore, when k &gt;1, f(x) has a maximum at x=1.If k =1, then numerator=0, so f’(x)=0 everywhere? Wait, no. Wait, if k=1, the numerator is (1 -1)(x² -1)=0, so derivative is zero only when x=1, but since k=1, the function simplifies to f(x)= (x² +x +1)/(x² +x +1)=1. Therefore, when k=1, f(x)=1, which is constant.Therefore, in summary:- For k &lt;1, f(x) has a minimum at x=1.- For k &gt;1, f(x) has a maximum at x=1.- For k=1, f(x)=1.Therefore, let&#39;s compute f(1):f(1) = (1 +k +1)/(1 +1 +1)= (k +2)/3Therefore, for k &lt;1, the minimum value is (k +2)/3, and as x approaches 0+ or infinity, f(x) approaches 1. So, the range is [(k +2)/3,1).For k &gt;1, the maximum value is (k +2)/3, and as x approaches 0+ or infinity, f(x) approaches 1. So, the range is (1, (k +2)/3].For k=1, the range is {1}.Therefore, when considering the triangle inequality condition:For k &lt;1: range [(k +2)/3,1), need 2*( (k +2)/3 ) &gt;1 ⇒k &gt;-1/2For k &gt;1: range (1, (k +2)/3], need 2*1 &gt; (k +2)/3 ⇒k &lt;4Therefore, allowable k is (-1/2,4)But according to the analysis via derivative, when k &lt;1, f(x) attains its minimum at x=1, which is (k +2)/3, and approaches 1 as x approaches 0 or infinity. When k &gt;1, f(x) attains its maximum at x=1, which is (k +2)/3, and approaches 1 as x approaches 0 or infinity. Therefore, the range for k &lt;1 is [(k +2)/3,1), which includes the minimum but approaches 1. For k &gt;1, the range is (1, (k +2)/3], which approaches 1 and includes the maximum. For k=1, it&#39;s a constant function.Therefore, the range of f(x) for k ∈ (-1/2,4) is:- For -1/2 &lt;k &lt;1: [(k +2)/3,1), with minimum at x=1, and supremum 1.- For 1 ≤k &lt;4: (1, (k +2)/3], with infimum 1, and maximum at x=1.But when k approaches -1/2 from above, the minimum approaches ( (-1/2) +2 )/3= (3/2)/3=1/2. So, the range approaches [1/2,1). When k approaches 4 from below, the maximum approaches (4 +2)/3=2, so the range approaches (1,2].Therefore, overall, the combined range of f(x) for allowable k is [1/2,2). Wait, no. For k ∈ (-1/2,1), the range is [(k +2)/3,1). As k increases from -1/2 to1, the minimum increases from 1/2 to1. For k ∈ [1,4), the range is (1, (k +2)/3], where the maximum increases from1 to2. So, overall, the total range covered is [1/2,2). Therefore, if k is allowed to vary in (-1/2,4), the range of f(x) is [1/2,2). But this seems contradictory to previous analysis. Wait, no. Wait, for each k, the range is a specific interval. For each k, the range is either [(k +2)/3,1) or (1, (k +2)/3]. Therefore, the union over k ∈ (-1/2,4) of the ranges is [1/2,2). But the problem states that for any a,b,c&gt;0, f(a),f(b),f(c) can form the three sides of a triangle. Therefore, even if k is fixed, the range of f(x) is either [(k +2)/3,1) or (1, (k +2)/3], and for the triangle condition, for each fixed k, the range must satisfy 2L &gt;M or 2*L &gt;M.But in reality, the problem is for a fixed k, and all a,b,c&gt;0. So, when k is fixed, the range of f(x) is a specific interval. For example, if k=0, which is in (-1/2,1), the range is [(0 +2)/3,1)= [2/3,1). Then, 2*L=2*(2/3)=4/3 &gt;1, which is true. Thus, any three numbers in [2/3,1) will have sum of the two smallest &gt;= 2/3 +2/3=1.333... &gt;1, so satisfies triangle inequality.Similarly, if k=3, which is in (1,4), the range is (1, (3 +2)/3]=(1,5/3]. Then, 2*1=2 &gt;5/3≈1.666, which holds. Hence, any three numbers in (1,5/3] will satisfy the triangle inequality.However, if k approaches -1/2, say k=-0.4, then the range is [(-0.4 +2)/3,1)= [1.6/3,1)= [0.533...,1). Then, 2*0.533≈1.066 &gt;1, which holds. If k approaches 4 from below, say k=3.999, the range is (1, (3.999 +2)/3]≈(1,5.999/3]≈(1,1.9997]. Then, 2*1=2 &gt;1.9997, which holds.Therefore, the key is that for each k in (-1/2,4), the range of f(x) is an interval where 2L &gt;M. Therefore, the range of k is (-1/2,4), and this interval must correspond to the range of g(x)=2^x -3/2 over x ∈ [m,n]. So, g(x) has range [2^m -3/2,2^n -3/2]. To match the range of k, which is (-1/2,4), we set:2^m -3/2 = -1/2 ⇒2^m =1⇒m=02^n -3/2=4 ⇒2^n=5.5⇒n=log₂(11/2)Therefore, m=0 and n=log₂(11/2). Therefore, m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)=log₂(11) - log₂2=log₂11 -1.But this is a transcendental number and unlikely to be the answer expected. Maybe the problem has a different approach.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a misunderstanding. The problem says &quot;if k and g(x) can be interchanged, find the value of m +n&quot;. Given that k and g(x) can be interchanged, meaning they have the same range. The range of k is (-1/2,4), and the range of g(x) must also be (-1/2,4). But since g(x) is continuous over [m,n], its range is [g(m),g(n)]. To get the open interval (-1/2,4), we would need g(x) to approach -1/2 and 4 but not reach them, which would require the domain of x to be open intervals. However, the problem states x ∈ [m,n]. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for g(x) to have an open interval range. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem interpretation.Alternatively, the problem might consider k to be within the closed interval [-1/2,4], hence g(x)&#39;s range is [-1/2,4], which can be achieved with x ∈ [0, log₂(11/2)], giving m +n=0 + log₂(11/2)=log₂11 -1.But in many exams, especially Chinese ones, log₂(11) is not a standard answer. Perhaps I made a mistake in the problem&#39;s analysis. Let me re-express the final equations.Given that the range of k is (-1/2,4), and g(x)=2^x -3/2 must have the same range. Therefore:Lower bound:2^m -3/2=-1/2⇒2^m=1⇒m=0Upper bound:2^n -3/2=4⇒2^n=5.5⇒n=log₂5.5But 5.5=11/2, so log₂5.5=log₂11 -1Thus, m +n=0 + log₂11 -1=log₂11 -1But log₂11 is approximately 3.459, so log₂11 -1≈2.459. However, the problem might require an exact answer in terms of log base 2. Therefore, the answer is log₂11 -1. But how to write this in boxed notation? Perhaps boxed{log_2 11 -1}Alternatively, if the problem expects m and n to be such that g(x) has range including -1/2 and4, but since those are the endpoints, then m and n are 0 and log₂(11/2), and m +n=log₂(11/2). But log₂(11/2)=log₂11 -1, which is the same.Given that in Chinese mathematics competitions, answers involving logarithms are sometimes expressed in terms of logarithms, so this is plausible.Final Answer(1) boxed{text{Yes}}  (2) boxed{log_2 11 - 1}&lt;/think&gt;(1) Given ( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c ) for any ( x in mathbb{Z} ) always has ( f(x) geq f(0) ).

The options are A: a &lt; 3, B: a &gt; 3, C: a ≤ 3, D: a ≥ 3. Let me start by recalling some calculus concepts here. If a function is increasing on an interval, its derivative should be non-negative throughout that interval. So, first step, I should find the derivative of f(x).The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f’(x) = 3x² - a. Right? Because the derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -a x is -a, and the derivative of 100 is 0. So f’(x) = 3x² - a. Now, for f(x) to be increasing on (1, +∞), we need f’(x) ≥ 0 for all x in (1, +∞). So, 3x² - a ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 1. Let me write that inequality down: 3x² - a ≥ 0. Solving for a, this gives a ≤ 3x². Therefore, a must be less than or equal to 3x² for all x &gt; 1. But here&#39;s the catch: the inequality a ≤ 3x² has to hold for all x in (1, +∞). That means a has to be less than or equal to the minimum value of 3x² on the interval (1, +∞). Because if a is less than or equal to the smallest value that 3x² can take in that interval, then it will certainly be less than all the larger values of 3x² as x increases. So, what&#39;s the minimum value of 3x² when x &gt; 1? Let&#39;s think about the function 3x². It&#39;s a parabola opening upwards, right? So as x increases beyond 1, the value of 3x² increases as well. Therefore, the minimum value of 3x² on the interval (1, +∞) occurs at x = 1. Plugging in x = 1, we get 3*(1)² = 3. Therefore, the minimum of 3x² on (1, +∞) is 3 (approached from the right as x approaches 1). Therefore, in order for a ≤ 3x² to hold for all x &gt; 1, a must be less than or equal to this minimum value, which is 3. So, a ≤ 3. Let me check this again. If a is 3, then the derivative becomes 3x² - 3. At x = 1, this is 3*1 - 3 = 0. For x &gt; 1, 3x² will be greater than 3, so the derivative will be positive. Thus, when a = 3, the derivative is zero at x = 1 and positive for all x &gt; 1, which means the function is non-decreasing on [1, +∞), but since the problem states the interval is (1, +∞), then at x = 1, it&#39;s a closed interval point. But the question specifies increasing in (1, +∞), so perhaps even if the derivative is zero at x = 1, as long as it&#39;s positive for all x &gt; 1, then it&#39;s increasing on that open interval. Wait, actually, if the derivative is non-negative on (1, +∞), then the function is non-decreasing. But to be increasing, does the derivative need to be strictly positive? Hmm, the problem says &quot;increasing&quot;, which can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. In calculus, a function is considered increasing on an interval if, for any two points x1 &lt; x2 in the interval, f(x1) ≤ f(x2). If the derivative is non-negative, it&#39;s non-decreasing. If the derivative is positive except at isolated points, it&#39;s still considered increasing in some contexts. But in some stricter interpretations, &quot;increasing&quot; might mean strictly increasing, which would require the derivative to be positive everywhere. But the problem says &quot;increasing&quot;, not &quot;strictly increasing&quot;. So according to the standard definition, if the derivative is non-negative on the interval, the function is increasing (non-decreasing). However, in some textbooks, &quot;increasing&quot; might mean strictly increasing. This could be a point of confusion. Let me check the problem statement again. It says &quot;increasing in the interval (1, +∞)&quot;. Since the interval is open, (1, +∞), perhaps the function can have a derivative of zero at some points in the interval as long as it doesn&#39;t stay zero over an interval. But in our case, if a = 3, then f’(x) = 3x² - 3. So f’(x) = 0 when x = 1 or x = -1, but since we are only considering x &gt; 1, the derivative at x = 1 is zero, but for x &gt; 1, f’(x) = 3x² - 3 which is positive because x² &gt; 1, so 3x² &gt; 3, so f’(x) &gt; 0 for all x &gt; 1. Therefore, when a = 3, the derivative is positive for all x &gt; 1, which would make the function strictly increasing on (1, +∞). Wait, but if a = 3, then at x approaching 1 from the right, the derivative approaches 0, but is positive just above 1. So in that case, even though the derivative is zero at x = 1, which is the endpoint, but since the interval is open (1, +∞), the point x = 1 isn&#39;t included. Therefore, for all x &gt; 1, if a ≤ 3, then 3x² - a ≥ 3x² - 3. Since x &gt; 1, 3x² - 3 = 3(x² - 1) &gt; 0, because x² &gt; 1. Therefore, if a ≤ 3, then f’(x) = 3x² - a ≥ 3x² - 3 &gt; 0 for all x &gt; 1. Therefore, the derivative is positive on (1, +∞) if a ≤ 3. Hence, the function is strictly increasing on that interval. But if a &gt; 3, then let&#39;s say a = 4. Then f’(x) = 3x² - 4. Let&#39;s check for x near 1. For example, x = 1.1. Then 3*(1.1)^2 - 4 = 3*(1.21) - 4 = 3.63 - 4 = -0.37. So the derivative is negative there, which means the function is decreasing at x = 1.1. Hence, if a is greater than 3, there will be some interval near x = 1 where the derivative is negative, making the function decreasing there. Therefore, the function can&#39;t be increasing on the entire interval (1, +∞) if a &gt; 3. So, the correct range for a is a ≤ 3. Which is option C. Wait, but let me just confirm again. Suppose a is exactly 3. Then f’(x) = 3x² - 3. For x &gt; 1, x² &gt; 1, so 3x² - 3 &gt; 0. So, when a = 3, the derivative is positive for all x &gt; 1, so the function is increasing on (1, ∞). If a is less than 3, say a = 0, then f’(x) = 3x², which is always positive for all x, so certainly increasing on (1, ∞). If a is 3, it&#39;s positive for x &gt; 1, so also increasing. If a is greater than 3, then there&#39;s a region near x = 1 where the derivative is negative. Therefore, the maximum value of a for which the derivative is non-negative on (1, ∞) is a = 3, and any a less than that works too. Therefore, the range of a is all real numbers less than or equal to 3. Hence, the correct answer is C: a ≤ 3.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the range of the real number ( a ) for which the function ( f(x) = x^3 - ax + 100 ) is increasing in the interval ( (1, +infty) ), we need to analyze the derivative of the function. The derivative of ( f(x) ) is:[f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - a]For the function to be increasing on the interval ( (1, +infty) ), the derivative must be non-negative for all ( x ) in that interval. This requires:[3x^2 - a geq 0 quad text{for all} quad x &gt; 1]Solving for ( a ), we get:[a leq 3x^2 quad text{for all} quad x &gt; 1]The minimum value of ( 3x^2 ) on the interval ( (1, +infty) ) occurs at ( x = 1 ). Evaluating this, we find:[3(1)^2 = 3]Thus, ( a ) must be less than or equal to 3 to satisfy the condition ( 3x^2 - a geq 0 ) for all ( x &gt; 1 ). If ( a leq 3 ), the derivative ( 3x^2 - a ) is non-negative for all ( x &gt; 1 ), ensuring the function is increasing. If ( a &gt; 3 ), there will be values of ( x ) near 1 where the derivative is negative, making the function decreasing in that region.Therefore, the range of ( a ) is ( a leq 3 ), which corresponds to option C.[boxed{C}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, the function given is f(x) = x³ - a x + 100, and we&#39;re told it&#39;s increasing on the interval (1, +∞). We need to find the range of the real number a for which this is true. The options are A through D, with C and D involving 3. Let me think.First, I remember that for a function to be increasing on an interval, its derivative should be non-negative throughout that interval. So, the first step is to find the derivative of f(x). Let&#39;s compute that.The derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -a x is -a, and the derivative of the constant 100 is 0. So, f&#39;(x) = 3x² - a. Got that.Now, the function f is increasing on (1, +∞) if f&#39;(x) ≥ 0 for all x in that interval. So, we need 3x² - a ≥ 0 for all x &gt; 1. Which implies that a ≤ 3x² for all x &gt; 1.Hmm. So, the key here is that the inequality a ≤ 3x² must hold for every x greater than 1. Therefore, a has to be less than or equal to the minimum value that 3x² takes on in the interval (1, +∞). Because if a is less than or equal to the smallest value of 3x² in that interval, then it will automatically be less than or equal to all larger values of 3x² for bigger x.So, what is the minimum value of 3x² when x &gt; 1? Well, x² is an increasing function for x &gt; 0. Since x is greater than 1, the smallest x can be is just above 1. So, as x approaches 1 from the right, x² approaches 1² = 1. Therefore, the minimum value of 3x² on (1, +∞) is 3*(1)² = 3. But wait, since x is strictly greater than 1, does the function 3x² actually attain the value 3? No, because x is never equal to 1 in the interval (1, +∞). It approaches 3 as x approaches 1, but never actually gets there. So, does that mean the infimum is 3, but it never actually reaches 3?But in terms of the inequality a ≤ 3x² for all x &gt; 1, since 3x² can get arbitrarily close to 3 but is always greater than 3 for x &gt; 1. Therefore, a must be less than or equal to the lower bound of 3x² on that interval. Wait, but if 3x² approaches 3 as x approaches 1 from the right, then to satisfy a ≤ 3x² for all x &gt; 1, a must be less than or equal to 3. Because if a were greater than 3, then for x values just slightly bigger than 1, 3x² would be slightly bigger than 3, but if a is greater than 3, then there would be some x near 1 where 3x² - a would be negative, right?For example, suppose a = 4. Then at x = 1.1, 3*(1.1)^2 = 3*(1.21) = 3.63. So, 3.63 - 4 = -0.37, which is negative. That would mean f&#39;(x) is negative there, so the function is decreasing at x = 1.1, which contradicts the requirement that it&#39;s increasing on (1, +∞). Therefore, a cannot be greater than 3.But if a = 3, then f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 3. At x = 1, f&#39;(1) = 3*(1)^2 - 3 = 0. But x =1 is not included in the interval (1, +∞). For x &gt;1, even slightly, like x =1.0001, 3x² would be 3*(1.0001)^2 ≈ 3*(1.00020001) ≈ 3.0006, so 3.0006 -3 = 0.0006 &gt;0. So, if a=3, then f&#39;(x) is positive for all x &gt;1. Hence, f is increasing on (1, +∞). Therefore, a=3 is acceptable.Therefore, the range of a is all real numbers less than or equal to 3. Which would correspond to option C: a ≤3.Let me just verify once more. If a is less than 3, say a=2, then f&#39;(x) =3x² -2. For x&gt;1, 3x² is greater than 3*(1)^2=3, so 3x² -2 is greater than 3 -2=1&gt;0. Therefore, f&#39;(x) is positive everywhere in (1, +∞). If a=3, as discussed, f&#39;(x)=3x² -3. At x approaching 1 from the right, it approaches 0, but remains positive for x&gt;1. For a&gt;3, there exists points near x=1 where f&#39;(x) is negative, making f decreasing there. So, yes, a must be ≤3.Therefore, the correct answer is C: a ≤3.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the range of the real number ( a ) such that the function ( f(x) = x^3 - ax + 100 ) is increasing in the interval ( (1, +infty) ), we start by finding the derivative of ( f(x) ):[f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - a]For the function to be increasing on the interval ( (1, +infty) ), the derivative ( f&#39;(x) ) must be non-negative for all ( x ) in that interval.

Therefore, ( a ) must be less than or equal to 3 to satisfy the inequality for all ( x &gt; 1 ).If ( a ) were greater than 3, there would exist values of ( x ) near 1 where ( 3x^2 - a ) would be negative, contradicting the requirement that ( f(x) ) is increasing.

The lines form an angle θ, and their common perpendicular is A&#39;A with length d. Points E and F are on lines a and b respectively, with A&#39;E = m and AF = n. A&#39; is on line a, and A is on line b. Hmm, skew lines... right, they don&#39;t intersect and aren&#39;t parallel. The common perpendicular between them has length d, which is the shortest distance between the two lines. Let me visualize this. Line a has point A&#39;, and line b has point A, and the segment A&#39;A is perpendicular to both lines. The length of A&#39;A is d. Now, along line a, starting from A&#39;, we move a distance m to point E. Similarly, along line b, starting from A, we move a distance n to point F. I need to compute the distance EF. Since the lines are skew, the points E and F are not in the same plane, so EF isn&#39;t just a straight line in a plane. Maybe I can use coordinates to model this. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s put point A&#39; at the origin (0, 0, 0). Then, since A&#39;A is the common perpendicular, point A would be at (0, 0, d). Wait, but the common perpendicular&#39;s length is d, so maybe that&#39;s not right. Let me think again.Suppose line a is along the x-axis. Let&#39;s align the common perpendicular A&#39;A along the z-axis. So point A&#39; is at (0, 0, 0) on line a, and point A is at (0, 0, d) on line b. But line b is skew to line a, and they form an angle θ. So line a is along the x-axis, and line b is in some direction making an angle θ with the x-axis, but not in the same plane. Since they are skew, line b can be translated from line a and rotated by θ. Wait, maybe to set up coordinates, let me do this: Let line a be the x-axis. The common perpendicular between a and b is along the z-axis, from A&#39;(0, 0, 0) to A(0, 0, d). Then line b passes through A(0, 0, d) and is in a direction making an angle θ with the x-axis. But in which plane? Since the common perpendicular is along the z-axis, line a is x-axis, line b should lie in a plane parallel to the x-y plane but shifted up by d. Wait, but if they form an angle θ, then maybe line b is in a plane that&#39;s at an angle θ with the x-axis. Alternatively, perhaps line a is along the x-axis, and line b is in the y-z plane, passing through (0, 0, d), and making an angle θ with the x-axis? Hmm, maybe. Let me try to parametrize both lines.Let&#39;s set coordinates such that line a is the x-axis: any point on line a can be represented as (t, 0, 0), where t is a parameter. The common perpendicular connects A&#39;(0, 0, 0) on line a to A(0, 0, d) on line b. Then line b must pass through A(0, 0, d) and form an angle θ with line a. To parametrize line b, since it forms an angle θ with the x-axis, its direction vector would have components (cosθ, sinθ, 0), but since it&#39;s skew, maybe there&#39;s a component in the z-direction? Wait, no. The common perpendicular is along the z-axis, so the direction vector of line b must lie in the x-y plane. Because if it had a z-component, then the common perpendicular might not be along the z-axis. Wait, maybe.Let me recall that the direction vector of line b must be such that the angle between line a and line b is θ. Since line a is along the x-axis with direction vector i, line b has a direction vector v such that the angle between i and v is θ. So v could be (cosθ, sinθ, 0). But since line b is skew, it&#39;s not in the same plane as line a. But if line b is in the x-y plane shifted along z-axis, then lines a and b would be coplanar if they are both in x-y plane, but line b is shifted along z. Wait, no. If line a is along x-axis at z=0 and line b is along (cosθ, sinθ, 0) direction starting at (0,0,d), then these lines are skew? Let&#39;s see.Take two lines: line a is (t, 0, 0) and line b is (s cosθ, s sinθ, d), where s is a parameter. The distance between these lines is the length of the common perpendicular. Let&#39;s compute the distance between them to check if it&#39;s d. The formula for the distance between two skew lines is |( v1 - v0 ) · ( u × v )| / | u × v |, where v0 and v1 are points on each line, and u, v are direction vectors.Here, v0 for line a is (0,0,0), direction vector u is (1,0,0). For line b, v1 is (0,0,d), direction vector v is (cosθ, sinθ, 0). Then u × v is (0,0, sinθ). The vector v1 - v0 is (0,0,d). Then the numerator is (0,0,d) · (0,0,sinθ) = d sinθ. The denominator | u × v | = |sinθ|. So the distance is |d sinθ| / |sinθ| = d. That&#39;s correct. So this parametrization is valid.So line a: (t, 0, 0), line b: (s cosθ, s sinθ, d). The common perpendicular is between (0,0,0) on line a and (0,0,d) on line b. Now, points E and F are on lines a and b respectively. A&#39;E = m, AF = n. Since A&#39; is on line a at (0,0,0), moving along line a a distance m, point E will be at (m, 0, 0). Wait, but line a is parametrized by t, so if t is the parameter, then the distance from A&#39; is |t|. So point E is at t = m, so coordinates (m, 0, 0).Similarly, point A is on line b at (0,0,d). AF = n. The direction vector of line b is (cosθ, sinθ, 0), so moving along line b from A, which is at s=0, the distance moved is |s| * sqrt(cos²θ + sin²θ) = |s|. So AF = n implies s = n or s = -n. Assuming direction, probably s = n, so point F is at (n cosθ, n sinθ, d).Wait, but the direction vector is (cosθ, sinθ, 0), so moving s units along the direction vector from A(0,0,d) would give coordinates (0 + s cosθ, 0 + s sinθ, d + 0) = (s cosθ, s sinθ, d). So if AF = n, then the parameter s must satisfy |s| * sqrt(cos²θ + sin²θ + 0²) = |s| = n. So s = ±n. Depending on the direction. Let&#39;s assume s = n, so F is (n cosθ, n sinθ, d).Now, to find EF, which is the distance between E(m, 0, 0) and F(n cosθ, n sinθ, d). The distance formula in 3D is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2]. Plugging in the coordinates:EF = sqrt[(n cosθ - m)^2 + (n sinθ - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2]Simplify:= sqrt[(n cosθ - m)^2 + (n sinθ)^2 + d^2]Expanding (n cosθ - m)^2:= n² cos²θ - 2 m n cosθ + m² + n² sin²θ + d²Combine terms:= m² - 2 m n cosθ + n² (cos²θ + sin²θ) + d²Since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1:= m² - 2 m n cosθ + n² + d²Therefore, EF = sqrt(m² + n² + d² - 2 m n cosθ)Wait, that looks similar to the law of cosines. Interesting. So even though the points are in 3D, the formula resembles the 2D law of cosines with an additional d² term. That makes sense because the distance d is the separation along the common perpendicular, which is orthogonal to both lines. Therefore, the components along the lines contribute m and n with the angle θ between them, and then the perpendicular distance d is an independent component.But let me verify if this makes sense. If θ is 0, meaning the lines are parallel (but still skew), then cosθ = 1, so EF = sqrt(m² + n² + d² - 2 m n) = sqrt((m - n)^2 + d²). Which is correct: if the lines are parallel, then the distance between E and F would be sqrt((m - n)^2 + d²), which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides |m - n| and d. Similarly, if θ is 90 degrees, then cosθ = 0, so EF = sqrt(m² + n² + d²). Which also makes sense, since if the lines are perpendicular, the distance is the 3D diagonal.Therefore, the formula seems to hold. So the answer is sqrt(m² + n² + d² - 2 m n cosθ). Therefore, EF = √(m² + n² + d² − 2mn cosθ). But let me check again with coordinates. Suppose θ = 0. Then lines a and b are both along the x-axis but shifted in z by d. Then E is at (m, 0, 0), F is at (n, 0, d). Then EF distance is sqrt((n - m)^2 + 0 + d²), which matches the formula. If θ = 90 degrees, lines a is x-axis, line b is along y-axis at z = d. Then E is (m, 0, 0), F is (0, n, d). Then EF is sqrt((0 - m)^2 + (n - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2) = sqrt(m² + n² + d²), which matches. Another test: suppose m = n = 0, then E = A&#39; (0,0,0), F = A (0,0,d), so EF = d, which matches sqrt(0 + 0 + d² - 0) = d. Another case: d = 0. Wait, but d is the length of the common perpendicular. If d = 0, the lines would intersect, but they are given as skew, so d ≠ 0. So that&#39;s okay. Therefore, the formula seems consistent. So the answer should be the square root of (m² + n² + d² - 2 m n cosθ). Final AnswerThe length of ( EF ) is (boxed{sqrt{m^2 + n^2 + d^2 - 2mncostheta}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given two skew lines (a) and (b) forming an angle (theta), and their common perpendicular (A&#39;A) of length (d). Points (E) and (F) are taken on lines (a) and (b) respectively, with (A&#39;E = m) and (AF = n). We need to find the length (EF).1. Coordinate System Setup:   - Line (a) is along the x-axis with point (A&#39;) at ((0, 0, 0)).   - Line (b) passes through point (A) at ((0, 0, d)) and has a direction vector making an angle (theta) with the x-axis.2. Parametrization of Lines:   - Line (a) can be parametrized as ((t, 0, 0)).   - Line (b) can be parametrized as ((s costheta, s sintheta, d)).3. Coordinates of Points:   - Point (E) on line (a) at a distance (m) from (A&#39;) is ((m, 0, 0)).   - Point (F) on line (b) at a distance (n) from (A) is ((n costheta, n sintheta, d)).4. Distance Calculation:   - Using the distance formula in 3D, the distance (EF) is calculated as:     [     EF = sqrt{(n costheta - m)^2 + (n sintheta - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2}     ]   - Simplifying the expression:     [     EF = sqrt{(n costheta - m)^2 + (n sintheta)^2 + d^2}     ]     [     = sqrt{n^2 cos^2theta - 2mn costheta + m^2 + n^2 sin^2theta + d^2}     ]     [     = sqrt{m^2 + n^2 + d^2 - 2mn costheta}     ]Thus, the length of (EF) is (boxed{sqrt{m^2 + n^2 + d^2 - 2mncostheta}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the distance EF between two points E and F on skew lines a and b, respectively. The lines a and b form an angle θ, and they have a common perpendicular A&#39;A of length d. Points A&#39; and A are on lines a and b, respectively. The distances from A&#39; to E on line a is m, and from A to F on line b is n. First, let me visualize the problem. We have two skew lines, which means they don&#39;t intersect and aren&#39;t parallel. The common perpendicular between them is A&#39;A, with length d. So, A&#39; is on line a, A is on line b, and the segment A&#39;A is perpendicular to both lines. The angle between the two lines is θ. Points E and F are on lines a and b, at distances m and n from A&#39; and A, respectively. I need to compute the distance EF.Since the lines are skew, they aren&#39;t in the same plane, but we can use vector geometry to find the distance between E and F. Let me recall that in 3D geometry, the distance between two points on skew lines can be found using the formula that involves the cross product of the direction vectors of the lines. But I need to think carefully here because the points E and F are not arbitrary; they are at specific distances from A&#39; and A along their respective lines.Maybe I should start by setting up a coordinate system. Let&#39;s place point A&#39; at the origin. Since A&#39;A is the common perpendicular, and its length is d, point A will be at (0, 0, d). Wait, but maybe I need to align the lines a and b in such a way that the common perpendicular is along the z-axis. Let me think.Let me set up coordinates so that line a passes through point A&#39; (which we can take as the origin) and lies along the x-axis. Then, line b passes through point A (which would be at (0, 0, d)) and lies in a plane that makes an angle θ with the x-axis. However, since the lines are skew, line b can&#39;t be in the same plane as line a. Hmm, maybe the direction vectors of the lines will help here.Suppose line a is along the x-axis. Then, its direction vector is i (1, 0, 0). The common perpendicular is along the line from A&#39; (0,0,0) to A (0,0,d). So, the direction of the common perpendicular is along the z-axis. Now, line b passes through point A (0,0,d) and makes an angle θ with line a. Since the common perpendicular is along the z-axis, the direction vector of line b should lie in the y-z plane. Let me confirm this.If the common perpendicular is along the z-axis, then line a is along the x-axis, and line b is in some direction such that the angle between line a and line b is θ. Since the common perpendicular is the z-axis, the direction vector of line b should form an angle θ with the x-axis. However, because they are skew, line b can&#39;t be in the x-y plane. So, the direction vector of line b would have components in the x and z directions? Wait, no, maybe in the x and y? Wait, maybe I need to define the direction vectors properly.Alternatively, perhaps line a is along the x-axis, and line b is in a different plane. Let me recall that the angle between two skew lines is defined as the angle between their direction vectors when projected onto a plane. So, if two lines are skew, the angle θ between them is the angle between their direction vectors in the plane formed by one line and the direction of the common perpendicular. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to set up the coordinates step by step.Let&#39;s place point A&#39; at the origin (0,0,0). The common perpendicular is A&#39;A, so point A is at (0,0,d). Line a passes through A&#39; and has direction vector u, and line b passes through A and has direction vector v. The angle between u and v is θ. Since the common perpendicular is A&#39;A, the vector u and v must be such that the line segment A&#39;A is the shortest distance between the two lines, which is along the common perpendicular. The direction of the common perpendicular is perpendicular to both u and v.Wait, the common perpendicular direction is a vector that is perpendicular to both lines. So, the cross product of the direction vectors u and v should give a vector in the direction of the common perpendicular. Since the length of the common perpendicular is d, which is the minimal distance between the two lines. Let me recall that the distance between two skew lines can be computed as |(A - B) · (u × v)| / |u × v|, where A and B are points on the two lines, and u, v are direction vectors. In our case, the minimal distance is given as d, so that formula must equal d.But perhaps setting up coordinates is the way to go. Let me try again.Let me define coordinate system such that line a is the x-axis, passing through A&#39;(0,0,0). The common perpendicular is along the z-axis to point A(0,0,d). Now, line b passes through A(0,0,d) and makes an angle θ with line a (the x-axis). So, the direction vector of line b should have a component along the x-axis and some other component. Since the common perpendicular is along the z-axis, the direction vector of line b can&#39;t have a z-component? Wait, no, the direction vectors can have components in any direction as long as the angle between them is θ.Wait, but the common perpendicular is along the z-axis, so the direction vectors of lines a and b must lie in planes such that their cross product is along the z-axis. Let me think.If line a is along the x-axis, direction vector u = (1, 0, 0). Line b passes through (0,0,d) and has direction vector v such that the angle between u and v is θ. The common perpendicular is along the z-axis, so the cross product u × v must be a vector in the z-axis direction. Since u × v is perpendicular to both u and v, and we know the common perpendicular direction is the z-axis. Therefore, u × v must be a scalar multiple of the z-axis unit vector k.Compute u × v: if u = (1, 0, 0) and v = (v_x, v_y, v_z), then u × v = (0, 0, v_y). So, this cross product is (0, 0, v_y). For this to be in the z-axis direction, it just is. The magnitude of the cross product is |v_y|. The magnitude of the cross product is also |u||v|sinθ. Since u is a unit vector (1,0,0), |u| =1, and |v| is the magnitude of v, which is sqrt(v_x² + v_y² + v_z²). But we can choose v to be a unit vector for simplicity. Wait, but maybe we need to adjust the direction vector v such that the cross product u × v has magnitude equal to the sine of the angle θ.Wait, if u and v are unit vectors, then |u × v| = sinθ. But here, u is along x-axis, so v can be written as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) if it&#39;s in the x-z plane? Wait, but then u × v would be (0, 0, sinθ), which is along the z-axis, which is the direction of the common perpendicular. But if line b is in the x-z plane, then the common perpendicular between the two lines would be in the z direction? Wait, but line a is along the x-axis and line b is in the x-z plane, so they would be coplanar if line b is in the x-z plane, which would mean they are either intersecting or parallel. But since they are skew, they can&#39;t be coplanar. Therefore, line b can&#39;t lie in the x-z plane. Hence, my previous assumption is wrong.Therefore, if line a is along the x-axis, and line b is not in the x-z plane, then direction vector v must have a component in the y direction. Wait, but the cross product u × v is (0, 0, v_y). For the common perpendicular to be along the z-axis, the cross product must indeed be along the z-axis, so u × v must have only a z-component, which it does, (0, 0, v_y). Therefore, to have the common perpendicular along the z-axis, the cross product u × v must point in the z-direction, which it does. The magnitude of the cross product is |v_y|. Since the lines are skew, the distance between them is |(A - B) · (u × v)| / |u × v|. Here, point A is (0,0,0) on line a, and point B is (0,0,d) on line b. Then vector A - B is (0,0,-d). Then (A - B) · (u × v) = (0,0,-d) · (0,0,v_y) = -d v_y. The absolute value is | -d v_y | = d |v_y|. Then the distance is d |v_y| / |u × v|. But |u × v| = |v_y|. So the distance is d |v_y| / |v_y| = d. Which matches the given. Therefore, this setup works.Therefore, v must have a y-component such that the cross product u × v is (0,0,v_y). Since the cross product&#39;s magnitude is |u||v| sinθ = |v| sinθ. But |u| =1. The cross product&#39;s magnitude is |v_y|. Therefore, |v_y| = |v| sinθ. If we take v to be a unit vector, then |v_y| = sinθ, so v_y = ±sinθ. But since the angle between u and v is θ, we can define v as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but wait, if v is a unit vector, then (cosθ, 0, sinθ) would lie in the x-z plane, which we saw earlier causes the lines to be coplanar. So, that can&#39;t be. Wait, confusion arises here.Wait, perhaps the direction vector v should have components in x and y? Let me think again. If u is along x-axis (1,0,0), then v must have a direction such that the angle between u and v is θ, and the cross product u × v is along the z-axis. So, v can be (cosθ, sinθ, 0)? Wait, but then u × v would be (0,0, sinθ), which is along the z-axis, and the magnitude of the cross product is sinθ. If v is a unit vector, then yes. Then, the distance between the lines would be |(A - B) · (u × v)| / |u × v| = |(0,0,-d) · (0,0,sinθ)| / sinθ = | -d sinθ | / sinθ = d. Which works. So, in this case, direction vector v is (cosθ, sinθ, 0). But then line b is in the x-y plane? Wait, line a is along x-axis, line b is in the x-y plane. Then, they would be coplanar if they lie in the same plane, but line a is along x-axis through (0,0,0), and line b is along direction (cosθ, sinθ, 0) through (0,0,d). So, line a is in the x-y plane (z=0), and line b is in the plane z=d. Therefore, they are parallel planes? Wait, no, line b is in the plane z=d, moving in direction (cosθ, sinθ, 0). So, these are two skew lines: one along the x-axis in z=0, and the other in z=d plane, with direction (cosθ, sinθ, 0). The distance between them is d, which is correct. The angle between them is θ, as the angle between their direction vectors (1,0,0) and (cosθ, sinθ, 0) is θ. So this setup works.So, coordinates:Line a: through A&#39;(0,0,0) with direction u = (1,0,0).Line b: through A(0,0,d) with direction v = (cosθ, sinθ, 0).So, any point E on line a can be parametrized as A&#39; + mu = (m, 0, 0). Wait, but the problem states that A&#39;E = m. Since A&#39; is on line a, moving along line a from A&#39; by distance m would be the point E = (m, 0, 0). Similarly, point F is on line b such that AF = n. Since A is on line b at (0,0,d), moving along line b from A by distance n. The direction vector of line b is (cosθ, sinθ, 0), which is a unit vector because cos²θ + sin²θ =1. So, moving n units along line b from A would give point F = (0,0,d) + n*(cosθ, sinθ, 0) = (n cosθ, n sinθ, d).Therefore, coordinates:E = (m, 0, 0)F = (n cosθ, n sinθ, d)Now, the distance EF is the distance between these two points. Using the distance formula in 3D:EF = sqrt[(n cosθ - m)^2 + (n sinθ - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2]Simplify:= sqrt[(n cosθ - m)^2 + (n sinθ)^2 + d^2]Expand the terms:First, expand (n cosθ - m)^2:= n² cos²θ - 2 m n cosθ + m²Then, adding (n sinθ)^2:= n² cos²θ - 2 m n cosθ + m² + n² sin²θCombine n² cos²θ + n² sin²θ = n² (cos²θ + sin²θ) = n²So, total becomes:n² - 2 m n cosθ + m² + d²Therefore, EF = sqrt[m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ + d²]Wait, that seems like the law of cosines term m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ, plus d², all under the square root. So, the formula is sqrt(d² + m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ). Is that correct?Let me check with an example. Suppose θ = 0, meaning the lines are parallel (since the angle between them is 0, but they are skew, so actually, they can&#39;t be parallel). Wait, if θ = 0, but they are skew, then they can&#39;t be parallel. Wait, maybe θ is the angle between the direction vectors, so even if they are skew, θ can be 0? No, if θ is 0, then the lines are parallel, but since they are skew, they can&#39;t be parallel. So θ cannot be 0. Similarly, θ is between 0 and 180, excluding 0 and 180? Not sure, but assuming θ is given as some angle where the lines are skew.But let&#39;s take θ = 90 degrees. Then cosθ = 0, so EF = sqrt(d² + m² + n²). Which makes sense: if the lines are perpendicular, then the distance EF would be the hypotenuse of a rectangular prism with sides d, m, and n. So that checks out.Another case: suppose m = 0 and n = 0. Then E is A&#39; and F is A, so distance EF is d, which matches sqrt(d² + 0 + 0 - 0) = d. Correct.If θ = 90, m and n arbitrary, distance is sqrt(d² + m² + n²). Correct.If d = 0, the lines would intersect, but since d is the length of the common perpendicular, d ≠ 0. But if hypothetically d = 0, then the lines intersect, and EF would be the distance between points along the lines, which would be sqrt(m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ), which is the law of cosines. So the formula is combining the &quot;in-plane&quot; distance (law of cosines) with the perpendicular distance d. So the formula sqrt(d² + (EF_in_plane)^2) where EF_in_plane is sqrt(m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ). So Pythagorean theorem in 3D. That makes sense.Therefore, the final answer should be sqrt(d² + m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ).Wait, but let me check my parametrization again. When I parametrized line b, the direction vector is (cosθ, sinθ, 0), so moving along line b from A(0,0,d), so point F is (n cosθ, n sinθ, d). Then point E is (m, 0, 0). So, the difference in x-coordinates: n cosθ - m, difference in y-coordinates: n sinθ - 0 = n sinθ, difference in z-coordinates: d - 0 = d. Then, the distance squared is (n cosθ - m)^2 + (n sinθ)^2 + d^2, which expands to n² cos²θ - 2 m n cosθ + m² + n² sin²θ + d² = m² + n² (cos²θ + sin²θ) - 2 m n cosθ + d² = m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ + d². So yes, EF = sqrt(m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ + d²). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(d² + m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ).Alternatively, this can be written as sqrt(d² + (m - n cosθ)^2 + (n sinθ)^2) which simplifies to the same expression.So, the final answer is the square root of (d squared plus m squared plus n squared minus twice m n cosine theta). Therefore, EF = sqrt{d^2 + m^2 + n^2 - 2 m n cos theta}.I think that&#39;s correct. Let me check once again with another perspective. Suppose we project the points E and F onto the common perpendicular and the plane perpendicular to it. The distance EF can be seen as the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the length along the common perpendicular (which is d) and the other leg is the distance between the projections of E and F onto the plane perpendicular to the common perpendicular. In that plane, the projections of lines a and b would form an angle θ, and the projections of E and F would be at distances m and n from the projection of A&#39; and A. Then, the distance between these projections would be sqrt(m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ), by the law of cosines. Then, combining with the perpendicular distance d via Pythagoras gives the total distance EF as sqrt(d² + m² + n² - 2 m n cosθ). That makes sense. Therefore, I&#39;m confident that this is the correct answer.Final AnswerThe distance ( EF ) is (boxed{sqrt{d^2 + m^2 + n^2 - 2mncostheta}}).&lt;/think&gt;Given two skew lines (a) and (b) forming an angle (theta), and their common perpendicular (A&#39;A) of length (d). Points (E) and (F) are taken on lines (a) and (b) respectively, with (A&#39;E = m) and (AF = n). We need to find the distance (EF).1. Coordinate System Setup:   - Place point (A&#39;) (on line (a)) at the origin ((0, 0, 0)).   - Place point (A) (on line (b)) at ((0, 0, d)) since the common perpendicular (A&#39;A) is along the z-axis.   - Line (a) is along the x-axis with direction vector (mathbf{u} = (1, 0, 0)).   - Line (b) passes through (A(0, 0, d)) and has a direction vector (mathbf{v} = (costheta, sintheta, 0)) to maintain the angle (theta) with line (a).2. Parametrization of Points:   - Point (E) on line (a) is at ((m, 0, 0)) as it is (m) units from (A&#39;) along the x-axis.   - Point (F) on line (b) is at ((n costheta, n sintheta, d)) as it is (n) units from (A) along the direction vector (mathbf{v}).3. Distance Calculation:   - The coordinates of (E) are ((m, 0, 0)).   - The coordinates of (F) are ((n costheta, n sintheta, d)).   - Using the distance formula in 3D:     [     EF = sqrt{(n costheta - m)^2 + (n sintheta - 0)^2 + (d - 0)^2}     ]   - Simplifying the expression:     [     EF = sqrt{(n costheta - m)^2 + (n sintheta)^2 + d^2}     ]     [     = sqrt{n^2 cos^2theta - 2mn costheta + m^2 + n^2 sin^2theta + d^2}     ]     [     = sqrt{m^2 + n^2 (cos^2theta + sin^2theta) - 2mn costheta + d^2}     ]     [     = sqrt{m^2 + n^2 - 2mn costheta + d^2}     ]Thus, the distance (EF) is (boxed{sqrt{d^2 + m^2 + n^2 - 2mncostheta}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-ceb94754></div><p class="review-content" data-v-ceb94754><span class="icon" data-v-ceb94754>🔑:</span>Let the plane passing through b and parallel to a be alpha, and the plane passing through a and A A^{prime} be beta.
