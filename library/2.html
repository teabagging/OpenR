data-v-02a0f5b3>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the equation of a line that passes through the point (2, 0) and has a slope of 3. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this step by step. First, I remember that the general form of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the problem gives me the slope as 3, that means m is 3. So the equation so far is y = 3x + b. Now, I need to find b, the y-intercept. To find b, I can use the point that the line passes through, which is (2, 0). That means when x is 2, y is 0. I&#39;ll substitute those values into the equation to solve for b. Plugging in x = 2 and y = 0:0 = 3*(2) + b  0 = 6 + b  Subtracting 6 from both sides:  b = -6So the equation should be y = 3x - 6. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don&#39;t see y = 3x - 6. Let me check the options again:A: y = 3x + 2  B: y = 3x - 2  C: y = 3(x - 2)  D: y = 3(x + 2)Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify my calculation. The point is (2, 0), so x = 2, y = 0. Plugging into y = 3x + b:0 = 3*2 + b  0 = 6 + b  b = -6So that gives y = 3x - 6. Hmm, but none of the options have that. Wait, maybe the question expects the equation in a different form? Let me check option C and D. They are written in point-slope form. The point-slope form of a line is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is a point on the line. In this case, the point is (2, 0) and the slope is 3. So substituting into point-slope form:y - 0 = 3*(x - 2)  Simplifying that gives y = 3(x - 2), which is option C. So expanding option C: y = 3x - 6, which is the same as what I got earlier. But none of the options A, B, C, D have y = 3x -6 except maybe if I expand them. Let&#39;s check all options:Option A: y = 3x + 2. If I plug x = 2 into this, y = 3*2 + 2 = 8, which is not 0. So A is wrong.Option B: y = 3x - 2. Plugging x = 2: y = 6 - 2 = 4, which is not 0. So B is wrong.Option C: y = 3(x - 2) = 3x - 6. Plugging x = 2: y = 6 - 6 = 0. That works.Option D: y = 3(x + 2) = 3x + 6. Plugging x = 2: y = 6 + 6 = 12. Not 0. So D is wrong.Therefore, the correct answer must be option C. But why did my initial thought lead me to y = 3x -6, which is equivalent to option C? Maybe I was confused because the answer is written in point-slope form rather than slope-intercept. But since the question gives the options, C is the correct choice.Alternatively, some people might prefer to write the equation in point-slope form directly, which is exactly what option C is. So that&#39;s another way to approach it without converting to slope-intercept. Either way, the answer is option C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the equation of the line passing through the point (2, 0) with a slope of 3, we start by using the point-slope form of a line, which is ( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ). Here, the point ((x_1, y_1)) is (2, 0) and the slope ( m ) is 3. Substituting these values into the point-slope form gives:[y - 0 = 3(x - 2)]Simplifying this, we get:[y = 3(x - 2)]This equation is already one of the given options (Option C). To verify, we can expand it to slope-intercept form:[y = 3x - 6]Checking if this line passes through the point (2, 0):[y = 3(2) - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0]This confirms the equation is correct. We also checked the other options and found they do not satisfy the point (2, 0). Therefore, the correct answer is:[boxed{C}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the equation of a line that passes through the point (2, 0) and has a slope of 3. The options are given as A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that the general equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the problem gives me the slope as 3, I can plug that into the equation: y = 3x + b. Now, I need to find the value of b. To do that, I can use the point (2, 0) that the line passes through. So, substituting x = 2 and y = 0 into the equation y = 3x + b, I get:0 = 3*(2) + b0 = 6 + bSubtracting 6 from both sides gives b = -6.Wait, but none of the options have -6 as the y-intercept. Let me check the options again. Option A is y = 3x + 2, which would mean the y-intercept is 2. Option B is y = 3x - 2, so y-intercept is -2. Option C is y = 3(x - 2), which simplifies to y = 3x - 6. Option D is y = 3(x + 2), which is y = 3x + 6. Hmm, so according to my calculation, the y-intercept is -6, which would correspond to option C, because when I expand that, it becomes 3x - 6. But let me make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake here.Alternatively, maybe using the point-slope form of the equation would be better. The point-slope formula is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope. Given the point (2, 0) and slope 3, plugging these into the formula gives:y - 0 = 3*(x - 2)Simplifying that, it becomes y = 3(x - 2), which is exactly option C. Expanding that gives y = 3x - 6, so the y-intercept is -6, which matches my earlier calculation. However, when I first thought of slope-intercept form, I got the same result, but maybe I was confused because the options present different forms. Wait, the problem is multiple-choice, so maybe the answer is C, but let me check the other options just to be thorough. Option A: y = 3x + 2. If I plug x = 2 into this equation, y should be 3*2 + 2 = 8, but the point we have is (2, 0), so that&#39;s not correct. Option B: y = 3x - 2. Plugging x = 2 gives y = 6 - 2 = 4, which is still not 0. Option C: y = 3(x - 2) gives y = 0 when x = 2, which matches the point. Option D: y = 3(x + 2) would give y = 3*4 = 12 when x = 2, which is way off. So clearly, option C is the correct one.But wait, just to confirm once more, since the problem might present the equation in different forms. Option C is in point-slope form, centered at the given point (2, 0), which makes sense. So even without expanding, if we know that point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), then the equation would be y = 3(x - 2), which is exactly option C. Alternatively, if I think about the line passing through (2, 0) with slope 3, another way to check is to see if another point on the line can be found by moving one unit to the right and up by the slope. For example, starting at (2, 0), if I go 1 unit right to x = 3, then y should be 0 + 3 = 3. So the point (3, 3) should be on the line. Let&#39;s check which options satisfy this. Option A: y = 3x + 2. Plugging x = 3, y = 11, which is not 3. Option B: y = 3x - 2. Plugging x = 3 gives y = 7, still not 3. Option C: y = 3x - 6. Plugging x = 3, y = 3*3 - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3. That works. Option D: y = 3x + 6. Plugging x = 3 gives y = 15, which is incorrect. So again, option C is correct.Another way to check: maybe using intercepts. Let&#39;s find the x-intercept and y-intercept of each option and see if they make sense. The line passes through (2, 0), which is the x-intercept. So the x-intercept is 2. Let&#39;s check each option&#39;s x-intercept.For a line&#39;s x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x.Option A: y = 3x + 2. Setting y = 0: 0 = 3x + 2 → x = -2/3. But our x-intercept is supposed to be 2, so this is wrong.Option B: y = 3x - 2. Setting y = 0: 0 = 3x - 2 → x = 2/3. Not 2. Nope.Option C: y = 3x - 6. Setting y = 0: 0 = 3x - 6 → x = 2. Correct, that&#39;s the given point (2,0). So this works.Option D: y = 3x + 6. Setting y = 0: 0 = 3x + 6 → x = -2. Not 2. So D is wrong.Therefore, option C is correct. The answer must be C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the equation of the line passing through the point (2, 0) with a slope of 3, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is ( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ). Here, ( m = 3 ), ( x_1 = 2 ), and ( y_1 = 0 ).Substituting these values into the point-slope formula, we get:[y - 0 = 3(x - 2)]Simplifying this, we obtain:[y = 3(x - 2)]We can verify this by checking if the point (2, 0) satisfies the equation. Substituting ( x = 2 ) into the equation gives ( y = 3(2 - 2) = 0 ), which is correct. Additionally, expanding the equation ( y = 3(x - 2) ) results in ( y = 3x - 6 ), which has a y-intercept of -6. Checking the other options confirms that they do not satisfy the given point or slope.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>Using the point-slope form, the equation of the line passing through the point (2, 0) with a slope of 3 is obtained as y-0=3(x-2), which simplifies to y=3(x-2).

Let me start by recalling some vector concepts.First, the magnitude of a vector. For vector a = (1, -1), its magnitude |a| is calculated using the formula √(x² + y²). Plugging in the values, that would be √(1² + (-1)²) = √(1 + 1) = √2. So, |a| is √2, and since |b| is equal to |a|, that means |b| is also √2.Now, vector b is in the opposite direction of vector a. Hmm, opposite direction... I remember that if two vectors are in opposite directions, one is a scalar multiple of the other, and the scalar is negative. So, if vector a is in one direction, vector b would be -k * vector a, where k is a positive real number. But we also need the magnitude of b to be equal to the magnitude of a. Let me write that down.Let’s denote vector b as (b1, b2). Since it&#39;s in the opposite direction of vector a, vector b = -k * vector a, where k &gt; 0. So, vector b = -k*(1, -1) = (-k, k). Now, we need the magnitude of vector b to be √2. Let&#39;s compute the magnitude of vector b:|b| = √[(-k)² + (k)²] = √[k² + k²] = √[2k²] = k√2.But we know |b| must be equal to |a|, which is √2. Therefore,k√2 = √2Dividing both sides by √2 gives k = 1. So, k is 1. Therefore, vector b = (-1*1, -1*(-1)) = (-1, 1). Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. If vector a is (1, -1), then -k*(1, -1) would be (-k*1, -k*(-1)) which is (-k, k). So, substituting k = 1, that gives (-1, 1). Let me verify the magnitude of that vector. √[(-1)² + (1)²] = √[1 + 1] = √2, which matches. So that seems correct.But just to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up any signs. Let&#39;s think again. If vector a is (1, -1), then the direction of a is pointing in the direction of the first quadrant? Wait, actually, in standard coordinates, (1, -1) would be pointing to the fourth quadrant because x is positive and y is negative. So, the opposite direction would be towards the second quadrant, where x is negative and y is positive. So, vector b should be (-1, 1), which is in the second quadrant. The coordinates make sense in terms of direction.Alternatively, the unit vector in the direction of a is (1/√2, -1/√2). So, the unit vector in the opposite direction would be (-1/√2, 1/√2). Then, scaling this unit vector by the magnitude |b| = √2 would give (-1/√2 * √2, 1/√2 * √2) = (-1, 1). That checks out.So, both methods give me that vector b is (-1, 1). Let me just recap to ensure I didn&#39;t skip any steps. The key points were that opposite direction implies scalar multiplication by a negative, then ensuring that the magnitude is the same. Since the scalar k turned out to be 1, that gives the coordinates directly. Alternatively, using unit vectors and scaling also leads to the same result. Therefore, I&#39;m confident that the coordinates of vector b are (-1, 1).Final AnswerThe coordinates of overrightarrow{b} are boxed{(-1, 1)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given two vectors (overrightarrow{a}) and (overrightarrow{b}), where (overrightarrow{a} = (1, -1)) and (|overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}|), and (overrightarrow{b}) is in the opposite direction of (overrightarrow{a}):1. Calculate the magnitude of (overrightarrow{a}):   [   |overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}   ]   Therefore, the magnitude of (overrightarrow{b}) is also (sqrt{2}).2. Since (overrightarrow{b}) is in the opposite direction of (overrightarrow{a}), it can be expressed as a scalar multiple of (overrightarrow{a}) with a negative scalar. Let (overrightarrow{b} = -k overrightarrow{a}) where (k &gt; 0). This gives:   [   overrightarrow{b} = -k(1, -1) = (-k, k)   ]3. Calculate the magnitude of (overrightarrow{b}):   [   |overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{(-k)^2 + k^2} = sqrt{k^2 + k^2} = sqrt{2k^2} = ksqrt{2}   ]   Since (|overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{2}), we have:   [   ksqrt{2} = sqrt{2} implies k = 1   ]4. Substitute (k = 1) into the expression for (overrightarrow{b}):   [   overrightarrow{b} = (-1 cdot 1, -1 cdot (-1)) = (-1, 1)   ]5. Verify the magnitude of (overrightarrow{b}):   [   |overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}   ]Thus, the coordinates of (overrightarrow{b}) are (boxed{(-1, 1)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the coordinates of vector b, given that its magnitude is the same as vector a, which is (1, -1), and that vector b is in the opposite direction of vector a. Hmm, so first, maybe I should recall what it means for two vectors to be in opposite directions. I remember that vectors in opposite directions are scalar multiples of each other with a negative scalar. So if vector a is (1, -1), then vector b should be some scalar multiplied by a, but negative. But also, the magnitude of b has to be equal to the magnitude of a. Let me check that.First, let&#39;s find the magnitude of vector a. The magnitude |a| is calculated by the square root of (1^2 + (-1)^2). That would be sqrt(1 + 1) which is sqrt(2). So |a| is sqrt(2), and |b| is also sqrt(2). Since b is in the opposite direction, it should be a scalar multiple of a, but negative. Let&#39;s denote that scalar as k. So vector b = k * vector a. But since it&#39;s opposite direction, k should be negative. Also, the magnitude of b has to stay the same. Wait, but if we multiply vector a by a scalar, the magnitude of b would be |k| times the magnitude of a. Since we need |b| = |a|, that means |k| * |a| = |a|, so |k| = 1. Therefore, k must be -1, because we need the direction to be opposite. Let me verify that. If vector a is (1, -1), then multiplying by -1 gives (-1, 1). Let&#39;s check the magnitude of that. The magnitude would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2), which matches. So coordinates of vector b are (-1, 1). That seems straightforward, but let me make sure there&#39;s no other possible answer.Is there another vector with magnitude sqrt(2) in the opposite direction? Well, direction is determined by the unit vector. The unit vector in the direction of a is (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). The opposite direction would be (-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), but if we multiply this unit vector by the magnitude sqrt(2), we get (-1, 1) as well. So yes, that&#39;s the same as before. So the coordinates of vector b must be (-1, 1). Wait, let me think again. Suppose someone suggests another vector. For example, if you take vector a and rotate it 180 degrees, which would be the same as multiplying by -1, resulting in (-1, 1). That&#39;s exactly what we did. So there are no other vectors with the same magnitude in exactly the opposite direction. Because direction is determined by the angle, and opposite direction is 180 degrees different. So multiplying by any positive scalar would keep the direction the same, multiplying by a negative scalar reverses it. Since we need the magnitude to stay the same, scalar has to be -1. Therefore, the coordinates of vector b are (-1, 1). I think that&#39;s the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn&#39;t skip any steps. 1. Calculate |a|: sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).2. Since |b| = |a|, |b| = sqrt(2).3. Since b is opposite direction to a, b = -a.4. Therefore, b = -1*(1, -1) = (-1, 1).5. Verify |b|: sqrt((-1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), which matches.Yes, that all checks out. So I think that&#39;s the correct answer. It&#39;s important to remember that opposite direction means multiplying by a negative scalar, and since the magnitudes are equal, the scalar must be -1. So there&#39;s no other possibility here. Another way to think about it is that the direction of a vector is determined by its components. If you reverse both components&#39; signs, the direction is reversed. But in this case, since the original vector is (1, -1), reversing both components would give (-1, 1), which is exactly what we found. So that&#39;s consistent. I can&#39;t think of any other vector that would satisfy these conditions. For example, suppose someone thought maybe ( -1, -1), but that&#39;s not opposite direction. The direction of ( -1, -1) would be in a different quadrant. Let&#39;s see. The original vector a is (1, -1), which is in the fourth quadrant. The opposite direction would be pointing towards the second quadrant. The vector (-1, 1) is indeed in the second quadrant. Whereas (-1, -1) is in the third quadrant, which is not opposite. So that&#39;s incorrect. Similarly, (1,1) is in the first quadrant, which is not opposite. So yeah, only (-1,1) makes sense. Therefore, I&#39;m confident the answer is (-1, 1).Final AnswerThe coordinates of vector overrightarrow{b} are boxed{(-1, 1)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given two vectors (overrightarrow{a}) and (overrightarrow{b}), where (overrightarrow{a} = (1, -1)) and (|overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}|), and (overrightarrow{b}) is in the opposite direction of (overrightarrow{a}):1. Calculate the magnitude of (overrightarrow{a}):   [   |overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}   ]2. Since (|overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}|), the magnitude of (overrightarrow{b}) is also (sqrt{2}).3. For (overrightarrow{b}) to be in the opposite direction of (overrightarrow{a}), it must be a scalar multiple of (overrightarrow{a}) with a negative scalar. The scalar must be (-1) to maintain the same magnitude:   [   overrightarrow{b} = -1 cdot overrightarrow{a} = -1 cdot (1, -1) = (-1, 1)   ]4. Verify the magnitude of (overrightarrow{b}):   [   |overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}   ]Thus, the coordinates of (overrightarrow{b}) are (boxed{(-1, 1)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>Since |overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}| and overrightarrow{b} is in the opposite direction of overrightarrow{a},We can express overrightarrow{b} in terms of overrightarrow{a} as follows: overrightarrow{b} = -overrightarrow{a} Since overrightarrow{a} = (1, -1), we substitute this into the equation for overrightarrow{b}: overrightarrow{b} = -overrightarrow{a} = -(1, -1) By negating each component of the vector overrightarrow{a}, we obtain: overrightarrow{b} = (-1, 1) Thus, the coordinates of overrightarrow{b} are boxed{(-1, 1)}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95d0d1ff data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review" data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review-title" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>❓:</span>Kozhevnikov P.AOn each of two parallel lines a and b, 50 points were marked.What is the maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles with vertices at these points?</div><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here: On each of two parallel lines a and b, 50 points were marked. What is the maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles with vertices at these points?Hmm, let me try to figure this out. First, I need to understand the setup. There are two parallel lines, each with 50 points. We need to form triangles by choosing three points, and we want as many of those triangles as possible to be acute-angled. The question is asking for the maximum possible number, so I guess we need to arrange the points in some optimal way to maximize the number of acute triangles.Let me recall that a triangle is acute if all its angles are less than 90 degrees. So, for a triangle to be acute, none of its angles can be right or obtuse. Now, since the points are on two parallel lines, any triangle must have either two vertices on one line and one on the other, or all three vertices on one line. But wait, if all three vertices are on the same line, they can&#39;t form a triangle because they&#39;re colinear. So, all triangles must have two points on one line and one point on the other. That makes sense.So, any triangle will consist of two points from line a and one point from line b, or two points from line b and one point from line a. Let me note that the total number of triangles possible is C(50,2)*50 + C(50,2)*50 = 2*C(50,2)*50. Since C(50,2) is 1225, that&#39;s 2*1225*50 = 122500 triangles total. But not all of these are acute; we need to find the maximum number that can be acute.To maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points on lines a and b such that as many triangles as possible formed by two points on one line and one on the other are acute. So, perhaps the arrangement of the points affects the angles of the triangles. If we can position the points in such a way that most of these triangles are acute, then we can approach the maximum number.I need to recall some geometry here. Let&#39;s consider a triangle with two vertices on line a and one on line b. Let’s denote line a as the top line and line b as the bottom line. Let’s say the two points on line a are A and B, and the point on line b is C. Then triangle ABC is formed. We need to determine under what conditions this triangle is acute.Similarly, if we have two points on line b and one on line a, the same logic applies. So maybe the configuration is symmetric, so we can just analyze one case and double the result.First, let&#39;s fix the distance between the two parallel lines. Let’s call the distance h. Then, the positions of points on each line can be considered along the x-axis direction, since the lines are parallel. Let&#39;s set up coordinates: Let’s assume line a is along the x-axis at y=0, and line b is along the line y=h. Then, the points on line a are at positions (x, 0) and points on line b are at positions (x&#39;, h). Then, the triangle formed by two points on a and one on b would have coordinates (x1, 0), (x2, 0), (x3, h).We need all angles in this triangle to be acute. Let&#39;s recall that in a triangle, the sum of the squares of any two sides must be greater than the square of the third side for all three combinations. That is, for a triangle with sides of lengths a, b, c, the triangle is acute if and only if a² + b² &gt; c², a² + c² &gt; b², and b² + c² &gt; a².Alternatively, since the triangle&#39;s angles correspond to the opposite sides, an angle is acute if the square of its opposite side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.So, perhaps we can calculate the conditions for each angle in triangle ABC to be acute.Let me try to compute the sides of triangle ABC. Let’s take points A(x1, 0), B(x2, 0), and C(x3, h). The sides are AB, BC, and AC.AB is the distance between A and B on line a, so AB = |x1 - x2|.AC is the distance between A and C: sqrt((x1 - x3)^2 + h^2)Similarly, BC is sqrt((x2 - x3)^2 + h^2)So, to check if triangle ABC is acute, we need:AB² + AC² &gt; BC²AB² + BC² &gt; AC²AC² + BC² &gt; AB²Let me compute each of these inequalities.First, AB² + AC² &gt; BC²:AB² is (x1 - x2)^2AC² is (x1 - x3)^2 + h^2BC² is (x2 - x3)^2 + h^2So, (x1 - x2)^2 + (x1 - x3)^2 + h^2 &gt; (x2 - x3)^2 + h^2Simplify: (x1 - x2)^2 + (x1 - x3)^2 &gt; (x2 - x3)^2Similarly, expanding the squares:(x1² - 2x1x2 + x2²) + (x1² - 2x1x3 + x3²) &gt; (x2² - 2x2x3 + x3²)Combine terms on left:2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1x3 + x2² + x3²On the right: x2² - 2x2x3 + x3²Subtract the right side from both sides:2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1x3 + x2² + x3² - x2² + 2x2x3 - x3² &gt; 0Simplify:2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1x3 + 2x2x3 &gt; 0Factor:2x1² - 2x1(x2 + x3) + 2x2x3 &gt; 0Divide both sides by 2:x1² - x1(x2 + x3) + x2x3 &gt; 0Factor:x1² - x1x2 - x1x3 + x2x3 = x1(x1 - x2 - x3) + x2x3Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s see:x1² - x1x2 - x1x3 + x2x3 = x1² - x1(x2 + x3) + x2x3This is a quadratic in x1. Let me see if it factors:x1² - x1(x2 + x3) + x2x3 = (x1 - x2)(x1 - x3)Yes! Because:(x1 - x2)(x1 - x3) = x1² - x1x3 - x1x2 + x2x3So, that&#39;s exactly the expression. Therefore, the first inequality reduces to (x1 - x2)(x1 - x3) &gt; 0So, the first condition is (x1 - x2)(x1 - x3) &gt; 0Similarly, let&#39;s check the second inequality: AB² + BC² &gt; AC²AB² is (x1 - x2)^2BC² is (x2 - x3)^2 + h^2AC² is (x1 - x3)^2 + h^2So:(x1 - x2)^2 + (x2 - x3)^2 + h^2 &gt; (x1 - x3)^2 + h^2Simplify:(x1 - x2)^2 + (x2 - x3)^2 &gt; (x1 - x3)^2Expand the left side:x1² - 2x1x2 + x2² + x2² - 2x2x3 + x3²Right side:x1² - 2x1x3 + x3²Subtract right side from left side:(x1² - 2x1x2 + x2² + x2² - 2x2x3 + x3²) - (x1² - 2x1x3 + x3²) =-2x1x2 + 2x2² - 2x2x3 + 2x1x3Factor:-2x1x2 + 2x1x3 + 2x2² - 2x2x3Factor terms:2x1(x3 - x2) + 2x2(x2 - x3) = 2(x3 - x2)(x1 - x2)So, the inequality becomes 2(x3 - x2)(x1 - x2) &gt; 0Which simplifies to (x3 - x2)(x1 - x2) &gt; 0Similarly, the third inequality: AC² + BC² &gt; AB²AC² + BC² = (x1 - x3)^2 + h^2 + (x2 - x3)^2 + h^2 = (x1 - x3)^2 + (x2 - x3)^2 + 2h^2AB² = (x1 - x2)^2So, the inequality is:(x1 - x3)^2 + (x2 - x3)^2 + 2h^2 &gt; (x1 - x2)^2Expand left side:x1² - 2x1x3 + x3² + x2² - 2x2x3 + x3² + 2h²= x1² + x2² - 2x1x3 - 2x2x3 + 2x3² + 2h²Right side:x1² - 2x1x2 + x2²Subtract right side from left side:(x1² + x2² - 2x1x3 - 2x2x3 + 2x3² + 2h²) - (x1² - 2x1x2 + x2²) =-2x1x3 - 2x2x3 + 2x3² + 2h² + 2x1x2Factor:2x3² - 2x3(x1 + x2) + 2x1x2 + 2h²Hmm, not sure if that factors nicely. Maybe rearrange:= 2x3² - 2x3(x1 + x2) + 2x1x2 + 2h²= 2[x3² - x3(x1 + x2) + x1x2] + 2h²Notice that x3² - x3(x1 + x2) + x1x2 = (x3 - x1)(x3 - x2)Therefore, this becomes 2(x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) + 2h² &gt; 0So, the third inequality is:2(x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) + 2h² &gt; 0Which simplifies to:(x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) + h² &gt; 0So, summarizing the three conditions for triangle ABC to be acute:1. (x1 - x2)(x1 - x3) &gt; 02. (x3 - x2)(x1 - x2) &gt; 03. (x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) + h² &gt; 0Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me see if I can interpret these conditions.First condition: (x1 - x2)(x1 - x3) &gt; 0This means that (x1 - x2) and (x1 - x3) have the same sign. So, either x1 &gt; x2 and x1 &gt; x3, or x1 &lt; x2 and x1 &lt; x3. So, x1 is either to the right of both x2 and x3, or to the left of both.Second condition: (x3 - x2)(x1 - x2) &gt; 0Similarly, this means that (x3 - x2) and (x1 - x2) have the same sign. So, either x3 &gt; x2 and x1 &gt; x2, or x3 &lt; x2 and x1 &lt; x2.Third condition: (x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) + h² &gt; 0So, even if (x3 - x1)(x3 - x2) is negative, as long as h² is large enough to compensate, this inequality will hold. But h is the distance between the two parallel lines, which is fixed. So, depending on the positions of x1, x2, x3, this term might be positive or negative.Wait, but since h is fixed, we might need to consider how the positions of the points affect this term.Alternatively, maybe we can think about the positions of the points such that all these inequalities are satisfied.Alternatively, maybe there is a geometric interpretation. Let me think.If we have two points on line a (A and B) and one point on line b (C), the triangle ABC. For all angles to be acute, the projection of C onto line a must lie inside the segment AB. Wait, is that true?Wait, let&#39;s recall that in a triangle, the foot of the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse is the midpoint only in an isosceles right triangle. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, if we consider the projection of C onto line a, which is point D. Then, for the angle at C to be acute, perhaps D needs to lie inside the segment AB? Wait, not sure.Alternatively, maybe the position of C relative to A and B affects the angles. For example, if C is too far to one side, the angle at C might become obtuse.Alternatively, perhaps arranging all points such that for any two points on one line, the third point on the other line is not too far left or right, so that the triangle remains acute.Alternatively, maybe if all points on line a are arranged in a convex position relative to line b, but since the lines are parallel, convexity might not be the right term here.Wait, maybe we can model this by considering the positions of the points on each line. Let me consider that if we place the points on each line in such a way that for any two points on one line, the projection of the third point (on the other line) lies between them. That might help in making the triangle acute.Suppose we have points on line a and line b arranged in order, say from left to right. Let&#39;s say on line a, we have points A1, A2, ..., A50 from left to right, and similarly on line b, points B1, B2, ..., B50 from left to right. Then, if we take two points on line a, say Ai and Aj (i &lt; j), and a point Bk on line b. The projection of Bk onto line a is a point directly below Bk on line a. For the triangle AiAjBk to be acute, maybe Bk needs to be between Ai and Aj in some sense.Wait, let me think. If Bk is too far to the left of Ai, then the angle at Bk might become obtuse. Similarly, if Bk is too far to the right of Aj, the angle at Bk might be obtuse. So, perhaps to ensure that the angle at Bk is acute, Bk should be &quot;between&quot; Ai and Aj in some way. Since the lines are parallel, the horizontal positioning is key here.Alternatively, if the projection of Bk onto line a lies between Ai and Aj, then maybe the triangle AiAjBk is acute. Let me check.Suppose we have two points Ai and Aj on line a, and Bk on line b. Let’s denote the horizontal distance from Bk to Ai as d1, and to Aj as d2. The vertical distance between the lines is h. Then, the angle at Bk can be calculated using the coordinates.The vectors BAi and BAj would be (Ai - Bk) in coordinates. Let me compute the angle at Bk.Wait, coordinates: Ai is (xi, 0), Aj is (xj, 0), Bk is (xk, h). The vectors from Bk to Ai is (xi - xk, -h), and from Bk to Aj is (xj - xk, -h). The angle between these two vectors is the angle at Bk.To compute whether this angle is acute, the dot product of the two vectors should be positive. The dot product is:(xi - xk)(xj - xk) + (-h)(-h) = (xi - xk)(xj - xk) + h²For the angle to be acute, the dot product must be positive:(xi - xk)(xj - xk) + h² &gt; 0So, (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; h²Similarly, if we consider the projection of Bk onto line a, which is (xk, 0). If xk is between xi and xj, then (xk - xi)(xk - xj) is negative, so the product is negative, hence (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; h² automatically holds, since left side is negative and right side is positive. Therefore, the angle at Bk is acute.If xk is not between xi and xj, then (xk - xi)(xk - xj) is positive. So, in that case, we need (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; h² for the angle at Bk to be acute.So, for the angle at Bk to be acute, either xk is between xi and xj, or if xk is outside, then (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; h².Similarly, the angles at Ai and Aj need to be acute as well. Let me check the angle at Ai.The angle at Ai is between vectors Aj - Ai and Bk - Ai. Coordinates:Aj - Ai is (xj - xi, 0)Bk - Ai is (xk - xi, h)The dot product is (xj - xi)(xk - xi) + 0*h = (xj - xi)(xk - xi)For the angle at Ai to be acute, the dot product must be positive:(xj - xi)(xk - xi) &gt; 0Similarly, since xj &gt; xi (assuming i &lt; j), then (xj - xi) is positive. Therefore, (xk - xi) must be positive. So, xk &gt; xi.Wait, that is, the angle at Ai is acute if xk &gt; xi.Similarly, the angle at Aj is between vectors Ai - Aj and Bk - Aj.Ai - Aj is (xi - xj, 0)Bk - Aj is (xk - xj, h)The dot product is (xi - xj)(xk - xj) + 0*h = (xi - xj)(xk - xj)Again, (xi - xj) is negative since xi &lt; xj. Therefore, for the dot product to be positive (angle acute), (xk - xj) must also be negative. So, xk &lt; xj.Therefore, for both angles at Ai and Aj to be acute, xk must satisfy xi &lt; xk &lt; xj.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, if xk is between xi and xj, then both angles at Ai and Aj are acute, and the angle at Bk is also acute (as we saw earlier, since (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; 0 &lt; h²).Therefore, if the projection of Bk onto line a lies strictly between Ai and Aj, then all three angles of triangle AiAjBk are acute.Alternatively, if xk is outside of [xi, xj], then we might still have some angles acute, but not all.Wait, let&#39;s check. Suppose xk &lt; xi. Then, the angle at Ai would have a dot product (xj - xi)(xk - xi). Since xj &gt; xi and xk &lt; xi, (xk - xi) is negative, so the dot product is negative, meaning the angle at Ai is obtuse. Similarly, if xk &gt; xj, the angle at Aj would be obtuse. So, in order for both angles at Ai and Aj to be acute, xk must lie between xi and xj. Therefore, if xk is between xi and xj, then all three angles are acute. If xk is outside, then one of the angles at Ai or Aj is obtuse, so the triangle is not acute.But wait, the angle at Bk could still be acute even if xk is outside. Let&#39;s verify. Suppose xk is outside, say xk &lt; xi. Then, the angle at Bk would require (xk - xi)(xk - xj) &lt; h². Since xk &lt; xi &lt; xj, both (xk - xi) and (xk - xj) are negative, so their product is positive. So, we have positive &lt; h². So, if the product (xk - xi)(xk - xj) is less than h², then the angle at Bk is acute. However, even if that&#39;s the case, the angles at Ai and Aj would still be obtuse, as we saw.Therefore, the only way for triangle AiAjBk to be acute is if xk is between xi and xj. Because otherwise, even if the angle at Bk is acute, the angles at Ai or Aj would be obtuse.Wait, so that&#39;s a key insight. Therefore, in order for triangle AiAjBk to be acute, the point Bk must lie between Ai and Aj when projected onto line a. So, the horizontal coordinate xk of Bk must satisfy xi &lt; xk &lt; xj.Similarly, if we have two points on line b and one on line a, the same logic applies: the point on line a must lie between the two points on line b when projected onto line b.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points on each line such that for as many pairs of points on one line as possible, there is a point on the other line lying between them.Wait, but how do we arrange 50 points on each line to maximize the number of such triples?Wait, the problem is about two parallel lines with 50 points each. So, if we arrange the points on both lines in the same order, say from left to right, then for any two points on line a, the points on line b that lie between them in projection would be the ones whose x-coordinates are between the x-coordinates of the two points on line a.But how does the arrangement affect this?Alternatively, if we interleave the points on the two lines. For example, if we arrange the points on line a and line b such that their projections on the x-axis alternate: a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., a50, b50. But since there are 50 points on each line, the total number would be 100 points if they alternate. Wait, but each line has 50 points. So maybe we can stagger them such that between every two points on line a, there is a point on line b, and vice versa. However, since there are 50 points on each line, if we spread them out equally, the spacing between consecutive points on each line would be the same. But how does that help?Wait, perhaps if we arrange the points such that for every pair of points on line a, there are as many points on line b lying between them as possible. Similarly for pairs on line b.So, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to maximize, for each pair on one line, the number of points on the other line lying between them. Therefore, the optimal arrangement is to have the points on both lines interleaved as much as possible.For example, if we arrange the points on line a and line b in such a way that the projections of the points on the other line divide the intervals between points. So, if line a has points at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b has points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100, then between any two consecutive points on line a, there is a point on line b, and vice versa. In this case, for any two points on line a, say at positions 1 and 3, there&#39;s a point on line b at 2 between them. Similarly, for positions 3 and 5, there&#39;s a point at 4, etc. However, this is only for consecutive points. For non-consecutive points, there may be more points in between.But the problem is with 50 points on each line. So, if we interleave them, then between any two points on one line, there is exactly one point on the other line. Wait, but 50 points on each line, so if we interleave them with 1 point of the other line between each pair, that would require 50 intervals on each line, each containing one point from the other line. But since the lines are infinite, we can do this.Wait, actually, in the example above with positions 1,3,5,... and 2,4,6,..., each interval between two points on line a (distance 2) contains exactly one point from line b, and vice versa. But if we have 50 points on each line, the minimal number of points on the other line between two points on one line would be 0 or 1, depending on the arrangement.But perhaps arranging the points in such a way that between any two points on one line, there are as many points as possible on the other line. Wait, but how?Alternatively, arrange the points on both lines in the same order, but offset so that each point on line b is placed between two points on line a. For example, if line a has points at x = 1, 2, 3, ..., 50, and line b has points at x = 1.5, 2.5, ..., 49.5. Then, each pair of consecutive points on line a has a point on line b between them. But for non-consecutive pairs on line a, say x=1 and x=3, there is a point at x=2 on line a, but on line b, there is x=1.5 and 2.5. Wait, in this case, x=1.5 is between x=1 and x=3, and x=2.5 is also between x=1 and x=3.Wait, but in this arrangement, between any two points on line a, there are multiple points on line b. For example, between x=1 and x=50 on line a, there are 49 points on line b. However, this might not be the case if the points on line b are only between consecutive points on line a.Wait, perhaps if we arrange the points in a way that all points on line b are inside the convex hull of the points on line a. But since the lines are parallel, the convex hull would be a rectangle, so all points on line b are within the horizontal span of line a&#39;s points.But maybe this is overcomplicating.Wait, let&#39;s step back. The key is that a triangle formed by two points on one line and one on the other is acute if and only if the third point lies between the two points when projected onto the other line.Therefore, for each pair of points on line a, the number of points on line b that lie between them (in terms of x-coordinate) will be the number of acute triangles formed with that pair. Similarly, for each pair on line b, the number of points on line a between them will contribute to the number of acute triangles.Therefore, to maximize the total number of acute triangles, we need to maximize the sum over all pairs on line a of the number of points on line b between them, plus the sum over all pairs on line b of the number of points on line a between them.So, the problem reduces to arranging the points on each line such that the number of pairs (on each line) with as many points as possible from the other line lying between them is maximized.This seems related to the concept of the number of inversions or something similar in combinatorics, but I need to think.Suppose that we arrange the points on line a and line b in such a way that their x-coordinates are interlaced as much as possible. For example, if the points on line a are at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and line b at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100, then between any two consecutive points on line a, there is exactly one point from line b. But for non-consecutive points on line a, the number of points from line b between them increases. For example, between 1 and 5 on line a, there are points 2, 4 on line b. Wait, but 2 is between 1 and 3, and 4 is between 3 and 5. So, between 1 and 5 on line a, there are two points from line b. Similarly, between 1 and 7 on line a, there are three points from line b, etc.But in this case, the number of points from line b between two points on line a is equal to the number of intervals between consecutive points on line a that lie between them. Each interval has one point from line b. Therefore, between the i-th and j-th points on line a (i &lt; j), there are (j - i - 1) points from line b.Similarly, the total number of acute triangles formed by pairs on line a and points on line b would be the sum over all pairs (i, j) on line a of the number of points on line b between i and j. Similarly for line b.But in the interleaved arrangement described above, the number of points on line b between two points on line a is (j - i - 1). Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a pairs is the sum over all i &lt; j of (j - i - 1). Similarly for line b.Wait, let&#39;s compute this sum. For line a, which has 50 points, the number of pairs (i, j) with i &lt; j is C(50, 2) = 1225. For each such pair, the number of points on line b between them is (j - i - 1). So, the total number is the sum_{i=1 to 49} sum_{j=i+1 to 50} (j - i - 1).Let me compute this:For each i from 1 to 49, and j from i+1 to 50:The term (j - i - 1) can be rewritten as (j - (i + 1)).So, for each i, the inner sum is sum_{k=1 to 50 - i - 1} k, where k = j - i - 1.Wait, for fixed i, j ranges from i+1 to 50. Let k = j - i - 1. Then, when j = i+1, k=0; j = i+2, k=1; ... j=50, k=50 - i -1. So the sum is sum_{k=0}^{50 - i -1} k} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k where n=50 -i. But sum from k=0 to n-1 of k is (n-1)(n)/2. So here, sum_{j=i+1 to 50} (j - i -1) = sum_{k=0}^{50 - i -1} k = (50 - i -1)(50 - i)/2 = (49 - i)(50 - i)/2.Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a pairs is sum_{i=1}^{49} (49 - i)(50 - i)/2.Let me compute this sum:Let m = 49 - i. When i =1, m=48; when i=49, m=0. So sum_{m=0}^{48} m(m +1)/2.Wait, (49 - i)(50 - i)/2 = (m)(m +1)/2 where m =49 -i.So sum_{i=1}^{49} (49 -i)(50 -i)/2 = sum_{m=0}^{48} m(m +1)/2.This sum is the same as sum_{m=1}^{48} m(m +1)/2 + (0)(1)/2 = sum_{m=1}^{48} [m(m +1)/2].Compute this sum:Note that m(m +1)/2 = C(m +1, 2). So sum_{m=1}^{n} C(m +1, 2) = C(n +2, 3).Here, n=48. So sum_{m=1}^{48} C(m +1, 2) = C(50, 3). Because C(n +2, 3) is the formula.Wait, let&#39;s check: C(3,3)=1, C(4,3)=4, C(5,3)=10,... So yes, the sum from m=1 to n of C(m +1,2) is C(n +2,3). Therefore, sum_{m=1}^{48} C(m+1, 2)= C(50,3)= 19600.But in our case, the sum is sum_{m=0}^{48} m(m +1)/2 = sum_{m=1}^{48} m(m +1)/2 = C(50,3) = 19600.Therefore, the total number of acute triangles from line a pairs is 19600. Similarly, the total number from line b pairs is also 19600, assuming the same arrangement. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles is 19600 + 19600 = 39200.But wait, in the interleaved arrangement where line a has points at 1,3,5,...,99 and line b at 2,4,6,...,100, this would result in each pair on line a having (j - i -1) points on line b between them. But in that case, between any two points on line a, there are (j - i -1) points on line b. However, in reality, when the points are interleaved, between two points on line a, there are (j - i -1) points on line b. For example, between 1 and 3 on line a, there is one point (2) on line b. Between 1 and 5 on line a, there are two points (2,4) on line b, which is (5 -1)/2 -1 = 2 -1=1? Wait, no. Wait, between 1 and 5 on line a, the points on line b are 2,4, so two points. But (j - i -1) where i=1, j=5 (but in our numbering, the positions are 1,3,5,..., so the indices don&#39;t directly correspond to positions. Wait, perhaps confusion here.Wait, in the previous calculation, we assumed that the positions are ordered such that the points on line a are at positions 1,2,3,...,50, and line b are at positions 1,2,...,50 as well, but interleaved. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the calculation above, we considered the x-coordinates as ordered, but the indices i and j refer to the order of the points, not their actual positions.But regardless, if we have two lines with 50 points each, arranged such that between any two consecutive points on one line, there is a point from the other line, then the number of points on the other line between any two points on the first line is proportional to the distance between them in the ordering.But according to the previous calculation, if you arrange the points such that for each pair on line a, the number of points on line b between them is (j - i -1), then the total number of acute triangles would be C(50,3)*2=39200. However, is this actually achievable?Wait, but in reality, if you have 50 points on each line, interleaved such that between every two points on line a is a point from line b, then the number of points on line b between two points on line a is floor((number of intervals)/2). Wait, but if you have 50 points on line a, there are 49 intervals between them. If you interleave with 49 points on line b, but we have 50 points on line b. So, this might not align.Wait, perhaps the maximum number of points on line b that can lie between two points on line a is 49, but we have only 50 points on line b. Wait, no.Wait, let me think differently. Suppose we arrange the points on line a and line b such that they are in a grid-like pattern, with points on line a at positions 1, 2, 3, ..., 50, and points on line b at positions 1.5, 2.5, ..., 49.5. Then, between each pair of consecutive points on line a (i.e., between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, etc.), there is exactly one point from line b. For non-consecutive pairs, say between 1 and 3 on line a, there are two points from line b: 1.5 and 2.5. Similarly, between 1 and 4 on line a, there are three points from line b, etc.In general, between two points on line a with k intervals between them (i.e., k+1 points apart), there are k points from line b. Therefore, the number of points on line b between two points on line a separated by m positions is m -1.Wait, but in this arrangement, each point on line b is between two consecutive points on line a. Therefore, for any two points on line a, the number of points on line b between them is equal to the number of intervals between them, which is (j - i -1) if they are the i-th and j-th points. Therefore, in this case, the total number of acute triangles formed by pairs on line a is sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i -1). As we calculated before, this sum is C(50,3) = 19600. Similarly for line b. Therefore, total acute triangles would be 2*19600 = 39200.But in this arrangement, line b has only 49 points (if we have points at 1.5, 2.5, ..., 49.5), but the problem states there are 50 points on each line. Therefore, we need to adjust the arrangement to include 50 points on line b. So, perhaps we can have line a at integer positions 1 to 50, and line b at positions 0.5, 1.5, ..., 49.5. That would give 50 points on line b, each between the integers. Then, between each pair of consecutive points on line a, there is one point from line b. For non-consecutive pairs, the number of line b points between them is (j - i -1). For example, between 1 and 3 on line a, there is 1.5 and 2.5, so two points on line b. Wait, but in this case, j - i -1 = 3 -1 -1 =1. But actually, there are two points. Wait, maybe the formula isn&#39;t correct here.Wait, hold on. If line a has points at 1,2,...,50, and line b has points at 0.5,1.5,...,49.5, then between 1 and 2 on line a, there is 1.5 on line b. Between 2 and 3, there&#39;s 2.5, etc. So, between consecutive points on line a, there is one point from line b. But between 1 and 3 on line a, there are two points from line b: 1.5 and 2.5. So, between positions i and j on line a, the number of points on line b is (j - i). Because from i to j, the line b points are i+0.5, i+1.5, ..., j-0.5, which is (j - i) points.Wait, this seems different from the previous formula. Let me check. If i=1 and j=3, then between them on line b are 1.5 and 2.5, which is 2 points, which is (3 -1) = 2. Similarly, between 1 and 4, there are 3 points:1.5, 2.5,3.5. So, yes, (4 -1)=3. Therefore, in this arrangement, the number of points on line b between i and j is (j - i). Therefore, the total number of acute triangles formed by pairs on line a is sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i).Similarly, for line b, the points are at 0.5,1.5,...,49.5. So, between two points on line b, say 0.5 and 1.5, there is a point at 1 on line a. Similarly, between 0.5 and 2.5, there are two points on line a:1 and2. Therefore, between two points on line b, the number of points on line a between them is (k - l), where k and l are their indices. Wait, if the line b points are at 0.5,1.5,...,49.5, then the points on line a at 1,2,...,50 lie between them. For example, between 0.5 and1.5 on line b, there is1 point on line a. Between1.5 and2.5 on line b, there is1 point on line a, etc. For two points on line b separated by m positions, the number of points on line a between them is m. For example, between0.5 and2.5 on line b (separated by two positions), there are two points on line a:1 and2. Wait, no, between0.5 and2.5, there is1.5 and2.5? No, line a has points at1,2. So between0.5 and2.5 on line b, the points on line a between them are1 and2, which are two points. Wait, but in this case, between0.5 and2.5 on line b, there are two intervals:0.5 to1.5 and1.5 to2.5, each containing a point from line a. Wait, actually, between0.5 and2.5 on line b, the points on line a are1 and2, which are two points. So, the number of points on line a between two points on line b is equal to the number of intervals between them, which is (k - l). Wait, if line b points are at0.5,1.5,...,49.5, then between the i-th and j-th points on line b (i &lt; j), there are (j - i) points on line a between them. For example, between0.5 (i=1) and1.5 (j=2), there is1 point on line a (1). Between0.5 (i=1) and2.5 (j=3), there are2 points on line a (1 and2). Therefore, the number is (j - i).Therefore, similarly, the total number of acute triangles formed by pairs on line b is sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i). Which is the same as for line a.Now, let&#39;s compute sum_{i &lt; j} (j - i) for 50 points.This is equivalent to sum_{d=1}^{49} (50 - d) * d, where d is the distance between i and j (i.e., j - i = d). Because for each distance d, there are (50 - d) pairs with that distance.Therefore, sum_{d=1}^{49} d*(50 - d) = sum_{d=1}^{49} (50d - d²) = 50*sum_{d=1}^{49} d - sum_{d=1}^{49} d²Compute sum_{d=1}^{49} d = (49*50)/2 = 1225sum_{d=1}^{49} d² = (49)(49 +1)(2*49 +1)/6 = (49*50*99)/6Compute this:49*50 = 24502450*99 = 2450*(100 -1) = 245000 -2450 = 242550242550 /6 = 40425Therefore, sum_{d=1}^{49} d² = 40425Therefore, sum_{d=1}^{49} d*(50 - d) = 50*1225 -40425 = 61250 -40425 =20825Wait, but this contradicts our earlier calculation where we thought it was C(50,3)=19600. So, which one is correct?Wait, in the interleaved arrangement, the number of acute triangles from line a pairs is sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i). Let me check for small n.Take n=2 points on line a. Then, sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) = (2 -1) =1. But according to the formula sum_{d=1}^{n-1} d*(n -d) with n=2: sum_{d=1}^1 1*(2 -1)=1*1=1. Correct.For n=3, sum_{d=1}^2 d*(3 -d)=1*2 +2*1=2 +2=4. But the actual sum over i &lt; j is (2-1)+(3-1)+(3-2)=1+2+1=4. Correct.For n=4, sum_{d=1}^3 d*(4 -d)=1*3 +2*2 +3*1=3 +4 +3=10. The actual sum is 1+2+3 +1+2 +1=10. Correct.So, indeed, the formula sum_{d=1}^{n-1} d*(n -d) gives the total sum. For n=50, it&#39;s20825. Therefore, in the interleaved arrangement, each line contributes20825 acute triangles. Therefore, total acute triangles would be2*20825=41650.But in our previous calculation where we thought it was C(50,3)*2=39200, that was incorrect. The correct total is41650.But where did the C(50,3) come from? Wait, if we think of the number of triples where for each triple (i,k,j) with i &lt; k &lt; j, but no, in this case, the sum over i &lt;j of (j -i) is equivalent to sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{j=i+1}^{50} (j -i). Let&#39;s compute this sum for small n.Take n=3:i=1: j=2,3: (2-1)+(3-1)=1+2=3i=2: j=3: (3-2)=1Total sum:3+1=4. Which matches 20825 for n=3. So, for n=50, it&#39;s sum_{i=1}^{49} sum_{j=i+1}^{50} (j -i).Which is equal to sum_{d=1}^{49} (50 -d)*d = 20825.Therefore, in the interleaved arrangement where each pair (i,j) on line a has (j -i) points on line b between them, the total number of acute triangles from line a is20825. Similarly for line b, total is20825. Therefore, total acute triangles are41650.But wait, but according to the problem statement, there are 50 points on each line. However, in the interleaved arrangement I described earlier, line b has 50 points, but they are at positions0.5,1.5,...,49.5, which is 50 points. Then, each pair on line a (positions1 to50) has (j -i) points on line b between them. However, between1 and50 on line a, there are49 points on line b (from1.5 to49.5). But according to our formula, for i=1 and j=50, (j -i)=49. Which matches.Therefore, in this arrangement, the formula holds. Therefore, total acute triangles are41650.But the problem is asking for the maximum possible number. Is this arrangement optimal? Is there a way to arrange the points such that more triangles are acute?Wait, another thought: if we arrange all points on line b to lie between two specific points on line a, then the number of acute triangles formed with those two points would be high, but other pairs might not have any points between them. Therefore, to maximize the total number, it&#39;s better to distribute the points on line b evenly among the intervals of line a, so that each pair on line a has as many points on line b between them as possible.In the interleaved arrangement, each interval between two consecutive points on line a contains one point from line b. Therefore, for a pair of points on line a with d intervals between them, there are d points from line b between them. Thus, the number of acute triangles contributed by this pair is d.Therefore, the total is sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i). Which is the same as the sum we calculated:20825 per line.But is this the maximum possible?Suppose instead that we arrange the points on line b not interleaved, but clustered in some way. For example, suppose we put all points on line b to the right of all points on line a. Then, for any pair on line a, there are no points on line b between them. Therefore, all triangles formed by two points on line a and one on line b would not be acute (since the third point is outside, leading to obtuse angles). Conversely, if all points on line b are between two points on line a, say between the leftmost two points, then for pairs of points on line a outside this interval, there are no points on line b between them, so those triangles would be obtuse. Only pairs involving the leftmost two points on line a would have acute triangles. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would be much smaller.Therefore, distributing the points on line b as evenly as possible among the intervals of line a (and vice versa) seems to maximize the number of acute triangles.Therefore, the interleaved arrangement is optimal.But let&#39;s check if this is indeed the case.Assume we have two parallel lines with n points each. To maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points such that each pair on one line has as many points as possible from the other line between them.This is similar to a combinatorial problem where you want to maximize the number of triples (a, b, c) where a and b are on one line, and c is on the other line, and c is between a and b.The maximum number of such triples is achieved when the points on both lines are interleaved in such a way that the number of c&#39;s between any a and b is maximized.For n points on each line, if we interleave them such that between any two consecutive points on one line, there is one point from the other line, then for each pair (a_i, a_j) on line a, the number of points on line b between them is (j - i -1). Wait, but in the previous example with positions1,3,5,..., the number of points on line b between a_i and a_j is (j -i). Because between1 and3, there is2, which is1 point, but (j -i)=2-1=1.Wait, confusion between indices and positions again.If the points on line a are ordered a_1, a_2, ..., a_n from left to right, and similarly for line b, then if they are interleaved, each a_i is to the left of b_i, which is to the left of a_{i+1}. In this case, between a_i and a_{i+1}, there is one point b_i. Between a_i and a_{i+2}, there are two points: b_i and b_{i+1}, etc. So, for a pair (a_i, a_j) with i &lt; j, there are (j -i) points on line b between them. Because between a_i and a_j, there are the points b_i, b_{i+1}, ..., b_{j-1}. So, (j -i) points.Therefore, in this case, the number of points on line b between a_i and a_j is (j -i). Therefore, the total number of acute triangles is sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i). Similarly for line b.For n=50, this sum is20825 per line, so total41650.But in reality, arranging 50 points on each line in a perfectly interleaved manner is possible only if the number of points on each line is the same. For example, if we have n points on line a and n points on line b, we can interleave them as a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., an, bn. However, in this case, the distance between a_i and a_{i+1} is the same as between b_i and b_{i+1}. But in our case, the lines are parallel, so we can arrange the points in such a way on each line. For example, line a has points at x=1,3,5,...,99 and line b has points at2,4,6,...,100. Here, each pair of consecutive points on line a has one point from line b between them, and vice versa.Therefore, in this arrangement, the number of acute triangles is indeed sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for each line, totaling41650.But since the problem is about two lines with 50 points each, the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is41650.However, let me verify this with a smaller example. Let&#39;s take n=2 on each line. So, two points on line a: a1, a2; two points on line b: b1, b2. If we arrange them as a1, b1, a2, b2.Then, the pairs on line a are (a1,a2). The number of points on line b between them is1 (b1). So, acute triangles:1. Similarly, pairs on line b: (b1,b2). Number of points on line a between them:1 (a2). So, acute triangles:1. Total:2.But total triangles: C(2,2)*2 + C(2,2)*2 =2 +2=4. So, all triangles are acute? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the triangles are:From line a: (a1,a2,b1) and (a1,a2,b2)From line b: (b1,b2,a1) and (b1,b2,a2)Now, according to our previous logic, the acute triangles would be the ones where the third point is between the two points on the other line. So, for (a1,a2,b1), since b1 is between a1 and a2, this should be acute. Similarly, (a1,a2,b2) is not between a1 and a2 (b2 is to the right of a2), so this triangle should be obtuse. Similarly, (b1,b2,a1) has a1 to the left of b1, so obtuse; (b1,b2,a2) has a2 between b1 and b2, so acute. Therefore, total acute triangles:2. Which matches our previous count: sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for n=2: sum is1 per line, total2.Therefore, correct.Another example: n=3.Line a: a1, a2, a3 at positions1,3,5Line b: b1, b2, b3 at2,4,6Pairs on line a:(a1,a2): b1 between them. So1 acute triangle.(a1,a3): b1 and b2 between them. So2 acute triangles.(a2,a3): b2 between them. So1 acute triangle.Total for line a:1 +2 +1=4Similarly for line b:(b1,b2): a2 between them.1 acute triangle.(b1,b3): a2 and a3 between them.2 acute triangles.(b2,b3): a3 between them.1 acute triangle.Total for line b:1 +2 +1=4Total acute triangles:8.Total possible triangles: C(3,2)*3 + C(3,2)*3=3*3 +3*3=18. Only8 are acute.But according to our formula, sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for n=3 is sum_{d=1}^2 d*(3 -d)=1*2 +2*1=4 per line, total8. Correct.Therefore, the formula works.Therefore, for n=50, the total number of acute triangles is2*20825=41650.But wait, the problem says &quot;the maximum possible number&quot;. Is there a way to arrange the points such that more acute triangles are formed?Suppose we arrange the points not in a perfectly interleaved manner but in some other way. For example, group several points closely together on line a and spread out points on line b. But in this case, pairs on line a that are close together would have few points on line b between them, but pairs that are spread apart might have more. However, due to the limited number of points on line b, it&#39;s a balance.But the total number of acute triangles is the sum over all pairs on both lines of the number of points on the other line between them. To maximize this sum, we need to distribute the points on each line such that as many pairs as possible have as many points as possible from the other line between them.This is analogous to the problem of maximizing the sum of overlaps between intervals. The optimal arrangement is when the points on each line are interleaved with the points on the other line as much as possible, leading to the maximum number of between-ness.Therefore, the interleaved arrangement gives the maximum sum, which is2*sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for n=50, which is41650.But wait, the problem statement says 50 points on each line. However, when interleaving, if we have 50 points on each line, the positions would be something like line a at1,3,5,...,99 and line b at2,4,6,...,100. In this case, each line has50 points, and they are perfectly interleaved. Therefore, between any two points on line a, there are(j -i) points on line b between them. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles is41650.Therefore, the answer should be41650.But wait, let me confirm with another perspective.Suppose all points on line a are at x=1,2,...,50, and all points on line b are at x=1,2,...,50 as well, but line b is shifted vertically. In this case, for any two points on line a, say at x=i and x=j, the points on line b between them are those with x-coordinates between i andj. However, if the points on line b are at the same x-coordinates as line a, then there are(j -i -1) points on line b between i andj. Wait, but since lines are distinct, but points can be at the same x-coordinate? Wait, but the problem says &quot;marked&quot; points on each line. If the points can be placed anywhere, including overlapping when projected, but since the lines are parallel, overlapping projections would mean the points are vertically aligned. However, if two points are vertically aligned, then a triangle formed with them and another point would be degenerate or not? Wait, no. If two points are on different lines but have the same x-coordinate, then a triangle formed with them and another point would have a right angle at the third point if the third point is colinear in projection. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Suppose we have two points vertically aligned: A(x,0) on line a and B(x,h) on line b. Then, any triangle formed with A, B, and another point C would have a right angle at C if C is orthogonally projected to the line AB. Wait, this might complicate things.Therefore, to avoid right angles, perhaps we should arrange the points so that no two points are vertically aligned. Because if there are two points vertically aligned, then choosing a third point could form a right triangle, which is not allowed. But the problem allows for vertices at these points, but we are to count only acute-angled triangles. Therefore, if there are vertically aligned points, triangles involving them might have right angles, which we need to exclude.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, it&#39;s better to arrange the points so that no two points are vertically aligned. Therefore, the interleaved arrangement where no two points are vertically aligned is better.Therefore, going back to the previous arrangement where points on line a are at1,3,5,...,99 and line b at2,4,6,...,100, there are no vertically aligned points, and every triangle formed has the third point between the two points on the other line, hence acute.Therefore, this arrangement avoids right or obtuse triangles, and all triangles counted are acute.But wait, in reality, when we have points on line a at1,3,5,... and line b at2,4,6,..., then for a pair on line a at1 and3, the point on line b at2 is between them, so triangle1,3,2 is acute. Similarly, pair1,5 on line a has points2,4 on line b between them, so triangles1,5,2 and1,5,4 are acute. Wait, but triangle1,5,2: the point2 is between1 and5, so angles at1,5, and2 are all acute. Similarly for1,5,4: point4 is between1 and5, so acute.But what about triangle1,5,6? Point6 is on line b at6, which is to the right of5 on line a. So, the triangle1,5,6: the angle at5 would be obtuse, as the dot product at5 would be negative.But in our previous logic, only triangles where the third point is between the two points on the other line are acute. So, in this arrangement, the only acute triangles are those where the third point is between the two points on the other line. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles is indeed sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for each line, leading to41650.Therefore, the maximum possible number is41650.But let me check with a different arrangement. Suppose we arrange the points on line a and line b in the same order, but not interleaved. For example, all points on line a are to the left of all points on line b. Then, any triangle formed by two points on line a and one on line b would have the third point to the right of both, leading to an obtuse angle at the rightmost point. Similarly, triangles formed by two points on line b and one on line a would have the third point to the left of both, leading to an obtuse angle. Therefore, no acute triangles. Therefore, the number of acute triangles would be zero. So, the arrangement is crucial.Therefore, the interleaved arrangement is indeed optimal.Therefore, the answer should be41650.But wait, let&#39;s compute this value again for n=50.sum_{i &lt;j} (j -i) for n=50.As we calculated earlier, this is sum_{d=1}^{49} d*(50 -d).Which is50*sum_{d=1}^{49} d - sum_{d=1}^{49} d².sum_{d=1}^{49} d = (49*50)/2 =1225sum_{d=1}^{49} d² =49*50*99/6=40425Therefore,50*1225=6125061250 -40425=20825Therefore, per line,20825. Two lines, total41650.Yes, this is correct.Therefore, the maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles is41650.Final AnswerThe maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles is boxed{41650}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of acute-angled triangles formed by 50 points on each of two parallel lines, we need to consider the geometric conditions under which a triangle is acute. A triangle is acute if all its angles are less than 90 degrees. For two points on one line and one point on the other line, the triangle is acute if the third point lies between the projections of the two points on the other line.Key steps:1. Interleaved Arrangement: Arrange the points on each line such that they are interleaved with the points on the other line. This means that between any two consecutive points on one line, there is a point from the other line.2. Counting Acute Triangles: For each pair of points on one line, the number of points on the other line between them contributes to the number of acute triangles. For a line with 50 points, the number of such pairs and the points between them is calculated using combinatorial sums.Calculation:- For each line, the number of acute triangles formed by pairs of points on that line and points on the other line is given by the sum ( sum_{1 leq i &lt; j leq 50} (j - i) ).- This sum can be computed as ( sum_{d=1}^{49} d cdot (50 - d) ), which simplifies to ( 50 sum_{d=1}^{49} d - sum_{d=1}^{49} d^2 ).- Using the formulas for the sum of the first ( n ) integers and the sum of the squares of the first ( n ) integers, we find:  - ( sum_{d=1}^{49} d = frac{49 cdot 50}{2} = 1225 )  - ( sum_{d=1}^{49} d^2 = frac{49 cdot 50 cdot 99}{6} = 40425 )- Therefore, the number of acute triangles from one line is ( 50 cdot 1225 - 40425 = 20825 ).- Since there are two lines, the total number of acute triangles is ( 2 cdot 20825 = 41650 ).Thus, the maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles is (boxed{41650}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of acute-angled triangles that can be formed by 50 points on each of two parallel lines, a and b. Hmm, interesting. So, first, I need to visualize this setup. There are two parallel lines, each with 50 points. All the vertices of the triangles have to come from these points. But since the lines are parallel, any triangle formed must have vertices on both lines, right? Because if all three vertices are on the same line, it&#39;s degenerate—it doesn&#39;t form a triangle. So, every triangle must have two points on one line and one on the other, or all three points on different lines. Wait, but there are only two lines. So, triangles can have either two points on line a and one on line b, or two points on line b and one on line a. That makes sense.So, the total number of triangles possible is C(50,2)*50 + C(50,2)*50, which is 2*C(50,2)*50. Let me calculate that: C(50,2) is 50*49/2 = 1225. So, total triangles would be 2*1225*50 = 1225*100 = 122,500. But the question isn&#39;t asking for the total number, but the maximum number of acute-angled triangles. Hmm, so we need to figure out how to arrange the points on the two lines such that as many triangles as possible are acute-angled.But wait, the problem says &quot;vertices at these points,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t specify the positions of the points. Are we allowed to choose the positions of the 50 points on each line? The problem states: &quot;On each of two parallel lines a and b, 50 points were marked.&quot; It doesn&#39;t mention they are in any specific order or arrangement, so I think we can assume that we can place the points in any positions on the lines to maximize the number of acute-angled triangles. So the key here is to arrange the points on lines a and b in such a way that when we form triangles by picking two points from one line and one from the other, as many of those triangles as possible are acute-angled.First, let&#39;s recall that in a triangle, an acute triangle is one where all three angles are less than 90 degrees. To determine if a triangle is acute, we can use the law of cosines. For a triangle with sides of lengths a, b, c (with c being the longest side), the triangle is acute if a² + b² &gt; c². So, in any triangle, the square of the longest side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.Now, considering the triangles formed by two points on one line and one on the other. Let&#39;s fix line a and line b as horizontal lines, since they are parallel. Let&#39;s consider a coordinate system where line a is the x-axis, and line b is the line y = h, where h is the distance between the two lines. The positions of the points on line a can be (x_i, 0) for i = 1 to 50, and on line b as (y_j, h) for j = 1 to 50.Now, if we pick two points on line a, say (x1, 0) and (x2, 0), and one point on line b, (y1, h), then the triangle formed by these three points. Similarly, if we pick two points on line b and one on line a. The idea is to arrange the x_i and y_j such that as many of these triangles as possible are acute.First, let&#39;s analyze the triangle with two points on line a and one on line b. Let’s denote the two points on line a as A and B, and the point on line b as C. Then, the triangle ABC. Similarly, for two points on line b and one on line a, triangle ABD, where A and B are on line b, and D is on line a.To find whether triangle ABC is acute, we need to check all three angles. Let&#39;s first compute the lengths of the sides.Let’s denote the coordinates:- A = (x1, 0)- B = (x2, 0)- C = (y1, h)Then, the sides:AB: distance between A and B is |x1 - x2|.AC: distance between A and C is sqrt((x1 - y1)^2 + h²)BC: distance between B and C is sqrt((x2 - y1)^2 + h²)So, sides are |x1 - x2|, sqrt((x1 - y1)^2 + h²), sqrt((x2 - y1)^2 + h²)We need all three angles to be acute, which means for each angle, the square of the side opposite is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.So, first, check angle at A: opposite side is BC. So, BC² &lt; AB² + AC².Similarly, angle at B: opposite side is AC. So, AC² &lt; AB² + BC².Angle at C: opposite side is AB. So, AB² &lt; AC² + BC².So, all three inequalities must hold.But given that AB is along the line a, and AC and BC go up to line b, which is parallel. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify these inequalities.Let’s compute BC² and AC²:BC² = (x2 - y1)^2 + h²AC² = (x1 - y1)^2 + h²AB² = (x1 - x2)^2So, the angle at C is opposite AB. So, AB² &lt; AC² + BC². Let&#39;s substitute:(x1 - x2)^2 &lt; [(x1 - y1)^2 + h²] + [(x2 - y1)^2 + h²]Simplify the right-hand side:(x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y1)^2 + 2h²Let’s expand (x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y1)^2:= x1² - 2x1y1 + y1² + x2² - 2x2y1 + y1²= x1² + x2² - 2y1(x1 + x2) + 2y1² + 2h²But the left-hand side is (x1 - x2)^2 = x1² - 2x1x2 + x2²So the inequality becomes:x1² - 2x1x2 + x2² &lt; x1² + x2² - 2y1(x1 + x2) + 2y1² + 2h²Subtract x1² + x2² from both sides:-2x1x2 &lt; -2y1(x1 + x2) + 2y1² + 2h²Divide both sides by 2:- x1x2 &lt; -y1(x1 + x2) + y1² + h²Bring all terms to left-hand side:- x1x2 + y1(x1 + x2) - y1² - h² &lt; 0Factor terms:y1(x1 + x2) - y1² - x1x2 - h² &lt; 0Let’s rearrange:(y1(x1 + x2) - y1²) - x1x2 - h² &lt; 0Factor y1 out of the first two terms:y1(x1 + x2 - y1) - x1x2 - h² &lt; 0Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let’s group differently:(y1(x1 + x2) - x1x2) - y1² - h² &lt; 0Note that y1(x1 + x2) - x1x2 = y1x1 + y1x2 - x1x2 = x1(y1 - x2) + x2y1. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps complete the square?Alternatively, let&#39;s write the inequality as:y1² - y1(x1 + x2) + x1x2 + h² &gt; 0Multiply both sides by 1 (inequality direction remains):y1² - y1(x1 + x2) + x1x2 + h² &gt; 0This is a quadratic in y1: y1² - (x1 + x2)y1 + (x1x2 + h²) &gt; 0The quadratic in y1 is y1² - (x1 + x2)y1 + (x1x2 + h²). Let&#39;s compute its discriminant:D = (x1 + x2)^2 - 4*1*(x1x2 + h²) = x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² - 4x1x2 - 4h² = x1² - 2x1x2 + x2² - 4h² = (x1 - x2)^2 - 4h²If D &lt; 0, then the quadratic is always positive. If D &gt;= 0, then it has real roots and can be negative between them.So, for the quadratic to be always positive (i.e., the inequality holds for all y1), we need D &lt; 0:(x1 - x2)^2 - 4h² &lt; 0 =&gt; (x1 - x2)^2 &lt; 4h² =&gt; |x1 - x2| &lt; 2hSo, if the distance between the two points on line a is less than 2h, then the quadratic is always positive, meaning that for any y1, the inequality holds. Therefore, angle at C is acute regardless of y1, provided |x1 - x2| &lt; 2h.Alternatively, if |x1 - x2| &gt;= 2h, then D &gt;=0, so the quadratic can be negative for some y1. Therefore, angle at C may not be acute.Wait, but angle at C is just one angle. So even if angle at C is acute, we still need to check the other angles.But maybe we can find conditions where all three angles are acute.Alternatively, maybe focus on the angle at C first. For angle at C to be acute, AB² &lt; AC² + BC². As above, which requires |x1 - x2| &lt; 2h. So, if the distance between the two points on line a is less than 2h, then angle C is acute, regardless of where y1 is. If the distance is equal to or greater than 2h, then angle C might be obtuse, depending on y1.But angle C is the angle at the point on line b. So, if we fix the two points on line a with distance less than 2h, then angle C is always acute. Then, we need to check the other two angles at A and B.Let’s check angle at A: opposite side is BC. So, BC² &lt; AB² + AC².Similarly, angle at B: opposite side is AC. So, AC² &lt; AB² + BC².So, we need both of these inequalities to hold as well.So, angle at A: BC² &lt; AB² + AC²Compute BC²: (x2 - y1)^2 + h²AC²: (x1 - y1)^2 + h²AB²: (x1 - x2)^2So, inequality becomes:(x2 - y1)^2 + h² &lt; (x1 - x2)^2 + (x1 - y1)^2 + h²Simplify: subtract h² from both sides:(x2 - y1)^2 &lt; (x1 - x2)^2 + (x1 - y1)^2Expand both sides:Left-hand side: x2² - 2x2y1 + y1²Right-hand side: (x1 - x2)^2 + (x1 - y1)^2 = x1² - 2x1x2 + x2² + x1² - 2x1y1 + y1² = 2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1y1 + x2² + y1²So, inequality:x2² - 2x2y1 + y1² &lt; 2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1y1 + x2² + y1²Subtract x2² and y1² from both sides:-2x2y1 &lt; 2x1² - 2x1x2 - 2x1y1Bring all terms to left-hand side:-2x2y1 - 2x1² + 2x1x2 + 2x1y1 &lt; 0Factor terms:-2x1² + 2x1x2 + 2x1y1 - 2x2y1 &lt; 0Factor out 2:-2x1² + 2x1x2 + 2y1(x1 - x2) &lt; 0Divide both sides by 2:- x1² + x1x2 + y1(x1 - x2) &lt; 0Rearrange:- x1² + x1x2 + y1x1 - y1x2 &lt; 0Factor:x1(-x1 + x2 + y1) - y1x2 &lt; 0Hmm, not obvious. Maybe rearrange terms:(-x1² + x1x2) + (y1x1 - y1x2) &lt; 0Factor:x1(-x1 + x2) + y1(x1 - x2) &lt; 0Factor (x1 - x2):(x1 - x2)(-x1 + y1) &lt; 0Wait, let&#39;s check:x1(-x1 + x2) + y1(x1 - x2) = -x1² + x1x2 + y1x1 - y1x2= -x1² + x1x2 + x1y1 - x2y1= -x1² + x1(x2 + y1) - x2y1Not sure. Alternatively, factor:Let’s factor (x1 - x2):Wait, in the expression x1(-x1 + x2) + y1(x1 - x2), we can factor out (x1 - x2):= (x1 - x2)(-x1 + y1)Wait, let&#39;s see:x1(-x1 + x2) + y1(x1 - x2) = x1(-x1 + x2) + y1(x1 - x2) = (x1 - x2)(-x1 + y1)Yes! Because:(x1 - x2)(-x1 + y1) = x1*(-x1 + y1) - x2*(-x1 + y1) = -x1² + x1y1 + x1x2 - x2y1Which matches the original expression. So, the inequality becomes:(x1 - x2)(-x1 + y1) &lt; 0Which can be written as:(x1 - x2)(y1 - x1) &lt; 0So, the product of (x1 - x2) and (y1 - x1) is negative. Therefore, one of them is positive and the other is negative.So, either:Case 1: x1 - x2 &gt; 0 and y1 - x1 &lt; 0OrCase 2: x1 - x2 &lt; 0 and y1 - x1 &gt; 0So, in other words:If x1 &gt; x2, then y1 &lt; x1If x1 &lt; x2, then y1 &gt; x1So, angle at A is acute if y1 is between x1 and x2?Wait, let me clarify. Suppose x1 &gt; x2. Then, for angle at A to be acute, we need y1 &lt; x1. Similarly, if x1 &lt; x2, then y1 &gt; x1.But since x1 and x2 are two points on line a, which is horizontal. Let&#39;s fix an order. Suppose we arrange all points on line a in increasing order from left to right: x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; x50. Similarly for line b: y1 &lt; y2 &lt; ... &lt; y50.But maybe arranging them in some specific order can help. Wait, but the problem is to maximize the number of acute triangles. So, perhaps arranging the points on line a and line b in such a way that for many pairs (x1, x2) and points y1, the inequalities hold.Alternatively, maybe arrange the points on line a and line b in convex position? Wait, but they are on parallel lines, so convex position would mean something else.Alternatively, arrange the points on each line equally spaced? But maybe there&#39;s a better arrangement.Alternatively, if we arrange the points on line a and line b such that all points on line b are &quot;between&quot; the points on line a. Wait, but they are on different lines. Wait, perhaps arranging them such that the projection of line b&#39;s points onto line a are interleaved with the points on line a. That might help in creating more acute angles.Alternatively, perhaps placing the two lines very close together, so that h is very small. But h is fixed, as the distance between the two parallel lines. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify h. It just says two parallel lines with points marked. So, perhaps h can be chosen as part of the setup? Wait, the problem says &quot;were marked,&quot; so maybe h is given, but it&#39;s not specified. Therefore, perhaps we can choose h to maximize the number of acute triangles. Wait, but the problem is to find the maximum possible number, so h can be chosen optimally. Wait, but if h can be set, then we can choose h such that it helps in maximizing the number of acute triangles.But the problem statement doesn&#39;t mention anything about h. So, maybe h is arbitrary, but we can choose the positions of the points on the lines, as well as h. Hmm. Wait, but if we can choose h, then perhaps we can set h to be very small or very large. But h being very small would make the triangles almost degenerate, but maybe not. Wait, if h approaches zero, the two lines almost coincide, so the triangles become very &quot;flat,&quot; but since h is the vertical distance, when h is small, the vertical component is small, so the triangles are &quot;squashed&quot; vertically.Alternatively, if h is very large, the vertical distance dominates, so the triangles are &quot;tall and skinny.&quot;But how does this affect the angles?Let me think. Suppose we have two points on line a, separated by distance d, and a point on line b at height h. Then, the triangle formed has a horizontal base of length d and vertical height h. The angles at the base depend on the ratio of d and h.For example, if h is much larger than d, then the triangle is tall and skinny, and the angles at the base (on line a) will be small, and the angle at the top (on line b) will be large, approaching 180 degrees as h increases. Conversely, if h is much smaller than d, the triangle is flat, and the angle at the top (on line b) is acute, but the angles at the base could be obtuse.Wait, so if h is very small, then the vertical sides AC and BC are almost equal to the horizontal distances (x1 - y1) and (x2 - y1), but with a small vertical component. So, the angle at C (on line b) would be close to 180 degrees if x1 and x2 are on either side of y1. Wait, no. Wait, if h is very small, then the vertical component is negligible, so the triangle is almost a horizontal line segment AB with a slight elevation at C. Then, the angles at A and B would be close to 90 degrees, and the angle at C would be very small. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Suppose two points A and B on line a, separated by a distance d, and a point C on line b, vertically above the midpoint of AB. If h is very small, then triangle ABC is almost an isosceles triangle with base AB and height h. The angles at A and B would be slightly less than 90 degrees, and the angle at C would be very small. So, actually, all angles would be acute: angles at A and B approaching 90 degrees from below, and angle at C approaching 0 degrees. So, in this case, the triangle would be acute.But if point C is not above the midpoint, but shifted to one side, then as h approaches zero, the triangle becomes more skewed. For example, if C is almost directly above A, then angle at A approaches 0 degrees, angle at B approaches 180 degrees, and angle at C approaches 0 degrees. Wait, so in that case, the triangle would become obtuse at B. So, if we place point C near one end, then even for small h, the triangle could be obtuse.Therefore, to ensure that the triangle is acute, when h is small, we need point C to be not too far from the midpoint between A and B. But how does this relate to the arrangement of points?Alternatively, if we set h to be such that for any two points A and B on line a, placing point C on line b within some interval will result in an acute triangle, and outside that interval, obtuse.But this is getting complicated. Maybe there is a way to arrange the points on both lines such that when we select two points on one line and one on the other, the triangle is always acute. But is that possible?Alternatively, perhaps if we arrange the points on line a and line b in such a way that for any two points on line a, all points on line b are positioned such that the triangle is acute. Similarly for the reverse.But I need to think more systematically.First, note that for a triangle with two points on one line and one on another, the triangle&#39;s type (acute or obtuse) depends on the positions of these points. To maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange the points so that as many such combinations result in acute triangles.Perhaps a key idea is that if all the points on line b are placed in the region that would make the triangles acute when combined with any two points on line a. How can we arrange the points to achieve this?Wait, here&#39;s a thought. If we arrange the points on line a and line b in such a way that for any two points on line a, all points on line b lie within the intersection of the regions that would make the triangle acute. Similarly for two points on line b and one on line a.But how to define these regions?Let’s consider two points A and B on line a. For a point C on line b, triangle ABC is acute if all angles are acute. As we saw earlier, the critical conditions are:1. AB² &lt; AC² + BC² (angle at C is acute)2. AC² &lt; AB² + BC² (angle at B is acute)3. BC² &lt; AB² + AC² (angle at A is acute)But these three conditions must all hold.Alternatively, using the coordinates as before, with line a at y=0 and line b at y=h.Let’s suppose A is at (0,0), B is at (d,0), and C is at (x,h). Then, the triangle ABC has sides:AB = dAC = sqrt(x² + h²)BC = sqrt((d - x)^2 + h²)The conditions for an acute triangle are:1. d² &lt; x² + h² + (d - x)^2 + h²2. x² + h² &lt; d² + (d - x)^2 + h²3. (d - x)^2 + h² &lt; d² + x² + h²Simplify each condition:1. d² &lt; x² + (d - x)^2 + 2h²2. x² &lt; d² + (d - x)^23. (d - x)^2 &lt; d² + x²Let’s compute each:1. Expand right-hand side: x² + d² - 2dx + x² + 2h² = 2x² - 2dx + d² + 2h²   So inequality: d² &lt; 2x² - 2dx + d² + 2h²   Subtract d²: 0 &lt; 2x² - 2dx + 2h²   Divide by 2: 0 &lt; x² - dx + h²   Which is: x² - dx + h² &gt; 02. x² &lt; d² + d² - 2dx + x²   Simplify: x² &lt; 2d² - 2dx + x²   Subtract x²: 0 &lt; 2d² - 2dx   Divide by 2d (assuming d ≠ 0): 0 &lt; d - x   So: x &lt; d3. (d - x)^2 &lt; d² + x²   Expand left-hand side: d² - 2dx + x² &lt; d² + x²   Subtract d² + x²: -2dx &lt; 0   Since d &gt; 0 (assuming distance AB is positive), then: -2dx &lt; 0 =&gt; x &gt; 0So, combining these three conditions:From condition 1: x² - dx + h² &gt; 0From condition 2: x &lt; dFrom condition 3: x &gt; 0Therefore, the range of x for which triangle ABC is acute is 0 &lt; x &lt; d and x² - dx + h² &gt; 0.So, let&#39;s analyze the quadratic inequality x² - dx + h² &gt; 0.The quadratic equation x² - dx + h² = 0 has discriminant D = d² - 4h².If D &lt; 0, i.e., d² &lt; 4h², then the quadratic is always positive. Therefore, x² - dx + h² &gt; 0 for all x. Therefore, in this case, the conditions reduce to 0 &lt; x &lt; d. So, if the distance AB is less than 2h, then any point C on line b between A and B (projection onto line a) will result in an acute triangle.If D &gt;= 0, i.e., d² &gt;= 4h², then the quadratic has two real roots:x = [d ± sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2So, the inequality x² - dx + h² &gt; 0 holds when x &lt; [d - sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2 or x &gt; [d + sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2.But since we also have 0 &lt; x &lt; d (from conditions 2 and 3), the valid intervals are:0 &lt; x &lt; [d - sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2and[d + sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2 &lt; x &lt; dBut [d + sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2 is greater than d/2, and [d - sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2 is less than d/2.So, in the case when d &gt;= 2h, the points C that result in acute triangles are those that are either close to A (x &lt; [d - sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2) or close to B (x &gt; [d + sqrt(d² - 4h²)] / 2). The middle region between those two intervals would result in the triangle being obtuse.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, for each pair of points A and B on line a, we need as many points C on line b such that C lies in the intervals that satisfy the acute conditions.But how does this affect the maximum total count?Let’s consider that if we set h to be large enough such that for all pairs A and B on line a, the distance AB is less than 2h. Then, all such triangles would have angle at C acute, and if we also ensure that points C are placed such that angles at A and B are acute.Wait, but in the earlier analysis, even if AB &lt; 2h, angles at A and B still depend on the position of C. For example, if C is too close to A or B, then one of the angles at A or B could be obtuse.Wait, but in the case when AB &lt; 2h, condition 1 is automatically satisfied (angle at C is acute). Then, conditions 2 and 3 are x &lt; d and x &gt; 0, which are automatically satisfied if C is between the projections of A and B on line b. Wait, but in the coordinate system we set, line b is parallel to line a, so the projection is straightforward. But actually, the x-coordinate of C can be anywhere on line b, not necessarily between A and B. If we arrange points on line b spread out beyond the range of points on line a, then C could be outside the projection of A and B.But perhaps to maximize the number of acute triangles, we should arrange the points on line b such that for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are within the interval that makes the triangle ABC acute. Similarly, arrange points on line a such that for any two points C and D on line b, all points A on line a are within the interval that makes triangle ACD acute.But how can this be achieved?Alternatively, consider that if we arrange all points on line a and line b in such a way that the projection of line b onto line a is entirely within the convex hull of the points on line a, and vice versa. Wait, but since they are parallel lines, the convex hull would be a rectangle (or two lines). Not sure.Alternatively, if we interleave the points on line a and line b. For example, if the points on line a are at positions x1, x2, ..., x50, and the points on line b are at positions y1, y2, ..., y50, such that between every two consecutive points on line a, there is a point on line b. This interleaving might help in ensuring that for any two points on line a, there are points on line b in the &quot;middle&quot; region, which might lead to acute triangles.Alternatively, arrange all points on line a and line b in the same order, such that for each i, the point yi on line b is vertically above xi on line a. But in that case, if you take two points on line a and one on line b, the triangle might not be acute. For example, taking xi and xj on line a, and yk on line b. If yk is above xk, then depending on the distance between xi, xj, and yk, the triangle could be acute or not.Alternatively, if we arrange the points on line a and line b in a staggered formation, where the points on line b are shifted relative to line a. For example, each point on line b is at the midpoint between two consecutive points on line a. This might help in creating more acute angles.But perhaps the key idea is to ensure that for any two points on one line, the points on the other line are within a certain range that makes the triangle acute. If we can arrange both lines&#39; points such that every pair on one line has all points on the other line within the acute region, then all such triangles would be acute.But is this possible?Suppose we fix line a with points spaced in such a way that the distance between any two consecutive points is less than 2h. Then, for any two points on line a, their distance is less than 2h, so angle at C is acute for any C on line b. Additionally, if the points on line b are arranged such that for any two points on line a, the points on line b are not too close to either of the two points on line a, thus ensuring angles at A and B are also acute.Wait, but how to ensure angles at A and B are acute. Earlier, for angle at A, the condition was x &lt; d (if we set A at 0 and B at d). So, if points on line b are placed between A and B (projection-wise), then x &lt; d, so angle at A is acute. Similarly, angle at B requires x &gt; 0, which is already satisfied if points on line b are placed between A and B. Wait, but if points on line b can be placed outside the projection of A and B, then angles at A or B could be obtuse.Therefore, if we constrain all points on line b to lie within the projection of the leftmost and rightmost points on line a, then for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between A and B (assuming line b&#39;s points are within the convex hull of line a&#39;s points). In that case, angles at A and B would be acute, as x would be between 0 and d.But wait, in our coordinate system earlier, angle at A required x &lt; d and angle at B required x &gt; 0, but actually, in that coordinate system, A was at 0 and B at d. So, if C is between A and B on line b (i.e., 0 &lt; x &lt; d), then angles at A and B are acute. If C is outside (x &lt; 0 or x &gt; d), then angles at A or B could be obtuse.Therefore, if we arrange all points on line b to lie between the leftmost and rightmost points on line a, then for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between A and B (assuming line a&#39;s points are spread out and line b&#39;s points are within that spread). Wait, but actually, if line a has points from x_min to x_max, and line b has points from y_min to y_max, and y_min &gt;= x_min and y_max &lt;= x_max, then for any two points A and B on line a (assuming A is left of B), points C on line b would be between A and B only if y_min &gt;= A and y_max &lt;= B. But this is not necessarily the case unless line b&#39;s points are within every interval defined by pairs on line a.But that&#39;s impossible unless all points on line b coincide with points on line a, but they are on different lines.Therefore, perhaps another approach: If we arrange the points on both lines in the same order, say increasing from left to right, and interleaved. For example, the points on line b are placed such that each yi is between xi and xi+1 on line a. Then, for any two points on line a, say xi and xj (i &lt; j), the points on line b between xi and xj would be yi+1 to yj-1 (if interleaved). Then, selecting a point C on line b between xi and xj would result in an acute triangle.But if C is outside xi and xj, then angles at A or B could be obtuse. Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to arrange points on line b such that as many as possible lie between any two points on line a.This is similar to the problem of maximizing the number of intervals that contain points from the other line. If the points on both lines are interleaved, then for any two points on one line, there are many points on the other line between them.This suggests that arranging the points on both lines in a convex position, interleaved, would maximize the number of acute triangles. For example, if the points on line a are at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 and the points on line b are at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 (assuming 50 points on each line). Then, for any two consecutive points on line a (say 1 and 3), there is a point on line b (2) between them. Similarly, for two points on line a with several points between them, there are multiple points on line b in between.In such an arrangement, when we pick two points on line a, there are several points on line b between them, which would satisfy the conditions for the triangle being acute. Similarly, when picking two points on line b, there are points on line a between them.But how does this arrangement affect the angles? Let&#39;s take an example.Suppose line a has points at x = 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (50 points), and line b has points at x = 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 (50 points). Let the distance between the lines be h.Take two points on line a: say 1 and 3. The points on line b between them are 2. So, triangle formed by 1, 3 on line a and 2 on line b. Let’s compute the angles.Coordinates:A = (1, 0)B = (3, 0)C = (2, h)Compute the sides:AB = 2AC = sqrt((1-2)^2 + h²) = sqrt(1 + h²)BC = sqrt((3-2)^2 + h²) = sqrt(1 + h²)So, triangle ABC has sides 2, sqrt(1 + h²), sqrt(1 + h²). This is an isosceles triangle with base AB and two equal sides. The angles at A and B are equal.Using the law of cosines to check angles:Angle at C: opposite AB = 2.cos(angle C) = (AC² + BC² - AB²)/(2*AC*BC) = ( (1 + h²) + (1 + h²) - 4 ) / (2*(1 + h²)) )= (2 + 2h² - 4)/ (2*(1 + h²)) ) = (2h² - 2)/ (2*(1 + h²)) ) = (h² -1)/(1 + h²)For angle C to be acute, cos(angle C) &gt; 0 =&gt; (h² -1)/(1 + h²) &gt; 0Which is true if h² &gt; 1. If h² &lt; 1, cos(angle C) is negative, so angle C is obtuse. If h² =1, angle C is right.So, in this case, if h &gt;1, angle C is acute. If h &lt;1, angle C is obtuse.Similarly, angles at A and B:Using law of cosines:cos(angle A) = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC)But since AC = BC, this becomes:(4 + (1 + h²) - (1 + h²)) / (2*2*sqrt(1 + h²)) ) = 4/(4*sqrt(1 + h²)) ) = 1/sqrt(1 + h²)So, angle A = arccos(1/sqrt(1 + h²)). For angle A to be acute, 1/sqrt(1 + h²) &gt; 0, which is always true, but angle A is acute as long as angle A &lt; 90 degrees.Since cos(angle A) = 1/sqrt(1 + h²). For angle A &lt; 90 degrees, cos(angle A) &gt; 0, which is always true. But actually, since angle A is in a triangle, it&#39;s automatically less than 180. To be acute, we need angle A &lt; 90. Since cos(angle A) = 1/sqrt(1 + h²), which is positive, angle A is acute if cos(angle A) &gt; 0, which it is, but we need to ensure that angle A &lt; 90.Wait, cos(angle A) = adjacent / hypotenuse = 1/sqrt(1 + h²). Wait, no. Wait, in the Law of Cosines:cos(angle A) = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC)But since AC = BC, this simplifies to (AB²)/(2*AB*AC) = AB/(2*AC) = 2/(2*sqrt(1 + h²)) = 1/sqrt(1 + h²)Therefore, angle A is acute if cos(angle A) &gt; 0, which is always true, but the actual measure depends on h. For example, if h is very large, sqrt(1 + h²) ≈ h, so cos(angle A) ≈ 1/h, which approaches 0 as h increases. Therefore, angle A approaches 90 degrees from below as h increases. If h is 1, cos(angle A) = 1/sqrt(2), so angle A is 45 degrees. If h is small, say h approaches 0, then cos(angle A) approaches 1, so angle A approaches 0 degrees.Wait, so in this specific example, triangle ABC has angle C acute if h &gt;1, and angles at A and B are always acute (since they are less than 90 degrees). Wait, but when h &lt;1, angle C is obtuse, but angles at A and B are still acute.Therefore, in this case, to have triangle ABC acute, we need h &gt;1. If h &gt;1, angle C is acute, and angles at A and B are acute as well. Therefore, for h &gt;1, this triangle is acute.But this is just one example. If we arrange the points in an interleaved manner, and choose h sufficiently large (greater than the half-distance between consecutive points on line a), then perhaps all triangles formed by two adjacent points on one line and one point on the other line would be acute.But the problem allows us to choose the positions of the points, so maybe we can set h as part of the configuration. Wait, but the problem says &quot;two parallel lines a and b&quot;, but doesn&#39;t specify the distance. So, perhaps we can choose the distance h to be optimal for maximizing the number of acute triangles.Therefore, to maximize the number of acute triangles, perhaps we can set h to be large enough such that for any two points on line a, the distance between them is less than 2h. If we can ensure that for all pairs of points on line a, the distance between them is less than 2h, then angle at C (on line b) is always acute, regardless of where C is. Then, to ensure angles at A and B are acute, we need points C on line b to be between A and B in projection.But if we arrange all points on line b between the leftmost and rightmost points of line a, then for any two points A and B on line a, points C on line b are between them, ensuring angles at A and B are acute.Wait, but how can we ensure all points on line b are between the leftmost and rightmost points of line a? If we arrange both lines identically, with line b&#39;s points shifted vertically but horizontally covering the same interval as line a&#39;s points, then for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are within that interval, so between the leftmost and rightmost points of line a, but not necessarily between A and B.Therefore, unless line b&#39;s points are densely packed between every pair of points on line a, which would require an infinite number of points, but we only have 50 points.Alternatively, if we interleave the points as I thought before, so that between any two consecutive points on line a, there is a point on line b. Then, for any two consecutive points on line a, there is one point on line b between them. For non-consecutive points on line a, there are multiple points on line b between them.In such a setup, if h is chosen such that the distance between any two consecutive points on line a is less than 2h, then for any two points on line a, the angle at C is acute. Additionally, since points on line b are between the projections of the two points on line a, angles at A and B are also acute.Therefore, if we can arrange the points on both lines in an interleaved fashion with appropriate spacing and h, then every triangle formed by two points on one line and one on the other is acute.But let&#39;s check with a simple case. Suppose line a has points at positions 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 on the x-axis, and line b has points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 on the line y = h. The distance between consecutive points on line a is 2 units. So, to have angle at C be acute for any two points on line a, we need the distance between any two points on line a to be less than 2h. So, 2 &lt; 2h =&gt; h &gt;1. So, if we set h &gt;1, then for any two consecutive points on line a (distance 2), angle at C is acute. For non-consecutive points, say distance 4 (e.g., points at 1 and 5), we need 4 &lt; 2h =&gt; h &gt;2. Similarly, the maximum distance on line a is between 1 and 99, which is 98 units. So, to have 98 &lt; 2h =&gt; h &gt;49. If we set h &gt;49, then for any two points on line a, the distance between them is less than 2h, so angle at C is acute. Also, since all points on line b are within the interval [2, 100], which is within the projection of line a&#39;s points [1, 99] shifted by 1. Wait, no. Line a&#39;s points go from 1 to 99, line b&#39;s points go from 2 to 100. So, the projection of line b&#39;s points onto line a are from 2 to 100, which extends beyond line a&#39;s rightmost point at 99. So, the point 100 on line b is outside the projection of line a&#39;s points.Therefore, for two points on line a, say 1 and 99, the distance is 98. To have angle at C acute, we need h &gt;49. Then, points on line b between 2 and 100. If we take a point C at 100 on line b, then the triangle formed by 1, 99 on line a and 100 on line b. The distance AB is 98, AC is sqrt((1 - 100)^2 + h²) = sqrt(9801 + h²), BC is sqrt((99 - 100)^2 + h²) = sqrt(1 + h²). Let&#39;s check the angles.First, angle at C: AB² = 98² = 9604. AC² + BC² = (9801 + h²) + (1 + h²) = 9802 + 2h². So, 9604 &lt; 9802 + 2h² =&gt; which is true for any h. So, angle at C is acute.Angles at A and B: For angle at A, BC² &lt; AB² + AC². BC² =1 + h². AB² + AC² =9604 +9801 + h²= 19405 + h². So, 1 + h² &lt; 19405 + h² =&gt; 1 &lt;19405, which is true. So angle at A is acute.Similarly, angle at B: AC² &lt; AB² + BC². AC²=9801 + h². AB² + BC²=9604 +1 + h²=9605 + h². So, 9801 + h² &lt;9605 + h² =&gt;9801 &lt;9605, which is false. Wait, this can&#39;t be. Wait, what&#39;s going on here.Wait, angle at B is opposite AC. So, AC² &lt; AB² + BC²?Wait, angle at B is opposite AC. So, the condition is AC² &lt; AB² + BC². Plugging in the numbers:AC² = (1 - 100)^2 + h² = 9801 + h²AB² = (1 - 99)^2 = 9604BC² = (99 - 100)^2 + h² =1 + h²So, 9801 + h² &lt;9604 +1 + h² =&gt; 9801 &lt; 9605. Which is false. Therefore, angle at B is obtuse.Therefore, even though we set h &gt;49 to make angle at C acute, angle at B is obtuse because point C is outside the projection of AB onto line b.Therefore, this triangle is obtuse at B, despite h being large enough to make angle at C acute. This shows that just setting h to be large isn&#39;t sufficient. We also need the points on line b to be between the projections of the two points on line a.In this case, point C is at 100, which is to the right of point B at 99. Therefore, angle at B is obtuse. Therefore, to ensure that angles at both A and B are acute, point C must be between the projections of A and B onto line b.Therefore, if we arrange all points on line b to lie strictly between the leftmost and rightmost points on line a, then for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between A and B, ensuring that angles at A and B are acute.But in the previous example, line b&#39;s points go up to 100, while line a&#39;s go up to 99. If we instead arrange line b&#39;s points to be within line a&#39;s interval, say line a is from 1 to 99 and line b is from 2 to 98, interleaved, then for any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them. Wait, but if line a has points from 1 to 99, and line b from 2 to 98, then for the two leftmost points on line a (1 and 3), the leftmost point on line b is 2, which is between them. Similarly, for the two rightmost points on line a (97 and 99), the rightmost point on line b is 98, which is between them. For points in the middle, there are corresponding points on line b.In such an arrangement, for any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them. Then, if h is set such that the distance between any two points on line a is less than 2h, then all triangles formed by two points on line a and one on line b would be acute. Similarly, if we do the same for line b, then triangles formed by two points on line b and one on line a would also be acute.But how to arrange 50 points on each line such that this interleaving happens. For example, if line a has points at 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (50 points), then line b can have points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 98 (49 points). But wait, we need 50 points on each line. So, maybe line a has points at 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (50 points), and line b has points at 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 (50 points). But then line b&#39;s points extend beyond line a&#39;s. To prevent that, line b should have points from 2 to 99, but that would only give 49 points. Hmm, this seems tricky.Alternatively, if both lines have 50 points, interleaved. For example, line a: 1, 3, 5, ..., 99 (50 points), line b: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 (50 points). Then, the rightmost point on line b is 100, which is outside line a&#39;s rightmost point 99. So, when considering the two rightmost points on line a (97 and 99), the point 100 on line b is outside their projection, leading to an obtuse angle. Similarly, other edge cases.Therefore, perhaps instead of strictly interleaving, we need to arrange the points such that line b&#39;s points are shifted slightly to the right of line a&#39;s points, but not extending beyond. For example, line a: 1, 2, 3, ..., 50 (assuming spacing of 1 unit), and line b: 1.5, 2.5, ..., 49.5 (50 points). Then, each point on line b is between two consecutive points on line a. In this case, for any two points on line a, the points on line b between them are the ones that lie in that interval. If two points on line a are consecutive (distance 1 unit), then there&#39;s one point on line b between them. If two points on line a are k units apart, there are k-1 points on line b between them.In this case, if we set h such that the distance between any two points on line a is less than 2h, then angles at C are acute. Additionally, since all points on line b are within the projections of the pairs on line a, angles at A and B are also acute.But how to generalize this for 50 points on each line. Let&#39;s model this.Suppose we place the 50 points on line a at positions x1, x2, ..., x50, equally spaced with spacing d. Similarly, place the 50 points on line b at positions x1 + d/2, x2 + d/2, ..., x50 + d/2. So, each point on line b is midway between two consecutive points on line a. Then, the distance between consecutive points on line a is d, and the distance between any two non-consecutive points on line a is k*d, where k is the number of intervals between them.If we set h such that d &lt; 2h, then for consecutive points on line a, the distance is d &lt; 2h, so angle at C is acute. For non-consecutive points, the distance is k*d, so we need k*d &lt; 2h. However, for k=49 (the maximum distance between the first and last point), we have 49d &lt; 2h. If d is fixed, this would require h &gt;49d/2. But as k increases, h needs to be larger. However, if we let d be variable, we can set d such that even the maximum distance 49d &lt;2h. For example, set h=25d, then 49d &lt;2*25d=50d, which holds. So, in this case, for any two points on line a, the distance is less than 2h, so angle at C is acute.Additionally, since all points on line b are between the leftmost and rightmost points on line a (since they are shifted by d/2), for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between A and B. Wait, not necessarily. For example, if A is the first point on line a (x1) and B is the second point (x2), then the point C1 on line b is between them. But if A is x1 and B is x50, then points C on line b are from x1 + d/2 to x50 + d/2. Since x50 + d/2 is beyond x50, which is the rightmost point on line a. Therefore, some points on line b are outside the projection of A and B when B is the rightmost point.Wait, so in this arrangement, for the two leftmost points on line a, the points on line b between them are only the first midpoint. For the two rightmost points on line a, there are no points on line b between them, since line b&#39;s points go up to x50 + d/2, which is beyond x50.Therefore, this arrangement doesn&#39;t ensure that all points on line b are between any two points on line a. Thus, when selecting two points on line a where one is the last point, the points on line b beyond it would cause angles at B to be obtuse.Therefore, perhaps a better arrangement is to have both lines&#39; points within the same interval. For example, both lines have points from 0 to L, with line a&#39;s points at positions 0, d, 2d, ..., 49d, and line b&#39;s points at positions d/2, 3d/2, ..., 49d - d/2. Then, line b&#39;s points are strictly between line a&#39;s points. In this case, the maximum distance between two points on line a is 49d. If we set h such that 49d &lt; 2h, then angle at C is always acute. Also, all points on line b are between 0 and 49d, so for any two points A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between them (if A and B are the first and last points on line a). Wait, no. If A is 0 and B is 49d on line a, then points on line b go up to 49d - d/2, which is less than B. So, in this case, all points on line b are between A and B. Therefore, for any two points on line a, all points on line b are between them, ensuring angles at A and B are acute.Therefore, in this arrangement, if we set h such that the maximum distance between any two points on line a is less than 2h, then all triangles formed by two points on line a and one on line b are acute. Similarly, triangles formed by two points on line b and one on line a would also be acute if the same conditions are met.So, let&#39;s verify this.Suppose line a has points at positions 0, d, 2d, ..., 49d, and line b has points at d/2, 3d/2, ..., (49d - d/2). The distance between consecutive points on line a is d, and the maximum distance between any two points on line a is 49d. Set h such that 49d &lt; 2h =&gt; h &gt; 49d/2.For any two points A and B on line a, distance AB = kd, where k is from 1 to 49. Since kd &lt;=49d &lt;2h, angle at C is acute. Also, all points on line b are between 0 and 49d, so for any A and B on line a, all points C on line b are between them (since line b&#39;s maximum is 49d - d/2, which is less than 49d). Therefore, angles at A and B are acute.Similarly, for triangles formed by two points on line b and one on line a. The maximum distance between two points on line b is 49d - d/2 - d/2 = 48d. Set h such that 48d &lt;2h =&gt; h&gt;24d. Since we already have h&gt;49d/2=24.5d, which satisfies h&gt;24d. Therefore, angles at A (on line a) would be acute as well.Therefore, in this arrangement, with h&gt;24.5d, all triangles formed by two points on one line and one on the other are acute. Therefore, the total number of acute triangles would be the total number of triangles, which is 2*C(50,2)*50 = 2*1225*50=122,500.But this contradicts our earlier example where even with h&gt;24.5d, some triangles could still be obtuse. Wait, but in this specific arrangement, because all points on line b are within the convex hull of line a&#39;s points, and vice versa, and the distance h is set sufficiently large, all triangles are acute.Therefore, in this optimal arrangement, all possible triangles are acute, leading to the maximum number of acute triangles equal to the total number of triangles, which is 122,500. But this seems counterintuitive, as usually, you can&#39;t have all triangles acute. Wait, but in this specific setup, with points arranged in a certain way and h chosen appropriately, perhaps it&#39;s possible.But let&#39;s verify with a concrete example. Take two points on line a: 0 and d. Point C on line b is at d/2. The triangle has sides AB = d, AC = sqrt((d/2)^2 + h²), BC = sqrt((d/2)^2 + h²). This is an isosceles triangle with base d and two equal sides. The angle at C is opposite AB. Using the law of cosines:cos(angle C) = (AC² + BC² - AB²)/(2*AC*BC) = (2*(d²/4 + h²) - d²)/(2*(d²/4 + h²)) )= (d²/2 + 2h² - d²)/ (2*(d²/4 + h²)) )= (2h² - d²/2)/(2*(d²/4 + h²))= (4h² - d²)/ (2*(d² + 4h²))For angle C to be acute, cos(angle C) &gt;0 =&gt;4h² - d² &gt;0 =&gt; h &gt;d/2. Which is satisfied since h&gt;24.5d. So angle C is acute.Angles at A and B: Using law of cosines,cos(angle A) = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC) = (d² + (d²/4 + h²) - (d²/4 + h²))/(2*d*sqrt(d²/4 + h²)) )= d²/(2*d*sqrt(d²/4 + h²)) )= d/(2*sqrt(d²/4 + h²))Since h &gt;24.5d, sqrt(d²/4 + h²) ≈ h. So, cos(angle A) ≈ d/(2h) &lt; d/(2*24.5d) =1/49 ≈0.0204, which is positive, so angle A is acute.Similarly, angle B is the same as angle A, so acute.Therefore, this triangle is acute. Similarly, for any other triangle, since h is sufficiently large to ensure that the angle at the top is acute, and the points are arranged such that the other two angles are also acute.Therefore, in this optimal arrangement with h chosen large enough and points interleaved, all triangles are acute. Therefore, the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is equal to the total number of triangles, which is 122,500.But wait, this contradicts some geometric intuition. Normally, in a plane, you can&#39;t have all triangles acute. For example, in a set of points in general position, you can&#39;t have all triangles acute. But in this specific case, due to the points being arranged on two parallel lines with optimal spacing and distance, it might be possible.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the reasoning. Let me check another example.Take three points on line a: 0, d, and 2d. Take a point C on line b at 3d/2. The triangle formed by 0, 2d, and 3d/2. The sides:AB = 2dAC = sqrt((3d/2)^2 + h²) = sqrt(9d²/4 + h²)BC = sqrt((2d - 3d/2)^2 + h²) = sqrt(d²/4 + h²)Angle at C: opposite AB =2d. Check if AB² &lt; AC² + BC²:4d² &lt; (9d²/4 + h²) + (d²/4 + h²) = 10d²/4 + 2h² = 5d²/2 + 2h²Which is true since 4d² = 8d²/2 &lt;5d²/2 + 2h². Since h is large, this holds.Angles at A and B:For angle at A: opposite BC = sqrt(d²/4 + h²). Check BC² &lt; AB² + AC²:(d²/4 + h²) &lt;4d² +9d²/4 + h² =&gt; d²/4 &lt;4d² +9d²/4 =&gt; d²/4 &lt;25d²/4 =&gt; True.Angle at A is acute.For angle at B: opposite AC = sqrt(9d²/4 + h²). Check AC² &lt; AB² + BC²:9d²/4 + h² &lt;4d² +d²/4 + h² =&gt;9d²/4 &lt;17d²/4 =&gt;9 &lt;17, which is true. So angle at B is acute.Therefore, all angles are acute.Similarly, for the triangle formed by 0, 2d, and 5d/2 (next point on line b). Wait, but in our arrangement, line b&#39;s points are only between consecutive points on line a. So, the next point after 3d/2 would be 5d/2, which is between d and 2d. But if we take a point beyond 2d, but in our arrangement, line b&#39;s points only go up to 49d - d/2, which is less than 49d.But in any case, for any triangle formed by two points on line a and one on line b, the conditions hold. Therefore, it seems possible that all triangles can be acute if arranged properly.Therefore, if the points are arranged in such an interleaved manner with h sufficiently large, then all triangles are acute. Therefore, the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is the total number of triangles, which is 122,500.But the problem states &quot;the maximum possible number of acute-angled triangles with vertices at these points&quot;. However, in most combinatorial geometry problems, you can&#39;t have all triangles acute. But here, due to the constraints of points being on two parallel lines, it might be possible.But wait, actually, even in this setup, maybe there are some triangles that are right or obtuse. Let&#39;s consider a different example. Take two points on line a: 0 and 49d. Take a point C on line b at 49d - d/2. The triangle ABC has sides AB =49d, AC= sqrt((49d - d/2 -0)^2 + h²)=sqrt((48.5d)^2 + h²), BC= sqrt((49d - (49d -d/2))^2 + h²)=sqrt((d/2)^2 + h²).Check angles:Angle at C: opposite AB =49d.AB² = (49d)^2 =2401d²AC² + BC² = (48.5d)^2 + h² + (d/2)^2 + h²=2352.25d² +0.25d² +2h²=2352.5d² +2h²Since h&gt;24.5d, 2h²&gt;2*(24.5d)^2=2*600.25d²=1200.5d²So AC² + BC²=2352.5d² +1200.5d²=3553d²AB²=2401d² &lt;3553d². So angle at C is acute.Angle at A: opposite BC= sqrt((d/2)^2 + h²).BC²=0.25d² +h²AB² + AC²=2401d² +2352.25d² +h²=4753.25d² +h²So BC² &lt; AB² + AC² is true.Angle at B: opposite AC= sqrt(48.5²d² +h²).AC²=2352.25d² +h²AB² + BC²=2401d² +0.25d² +h²=2401.25d² +h²So AC² &lt; AB² + BC²?2352.25d² +h² &lt;2401.25d² +h²2352.25d² &lt;2401.25d²True.Therefore, all angles are acute.Therefore, even for the maximal distance on line a, the triangle is acute.Similarly, for triangles formed by two points on line b and one on line a, the same logic applies. Since line a&#39;s points are within the projection of line b&#39;s points, and h is sufficiently large, all angles are acute.Therefore, in this optimal arrangement, all possible triangles are acute. Therefore, the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is equal to the total number of triangles, which is 122,500.However, I need to confirm whether this is indeed possible. Let&#39;s refer to known results. In some configurations, like points arranged on two lines with certain spacing, it is possible for all triangles to be acute. For example, in the paper &quot;Acute Sets&quot; by Erdős and others, but I don&#39;t recall the specifics.But given the above analysis, where careful arrangement of points and choosing h appropriately allows all triangles to be acute, I think the answer is that the maximum number is the total number of triangles, which is 122,500.But wait, let me check another configuration. Suppose two points on line a and one on line b form a right triangle. For example, if AB is the diameter of a circle with C on the circumference, then angle at C is right. But in our case, points are on two parallel lines, so such a configuration isn&#39;t possible unless the points are arranged in a specific way. But in our interleaved arrangement with h sufficiently large, we avoid this.Therefore, after careful consideration and verification, I think the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is indeed the total number of triangles, which is 122,500.But wait, the problem says &quot;vertices at these points&quot;. If all triangles are acute, then the answer is 122,500. However, I recall that in planar point sets, there is a known result that you can&#39;t have all triangles acute. For example, every set of five points in general position contains a non-acute triangle. But in our case, the points are not in general position—they are on two parallel lines. So, maybe in this specific case, it&#39;s possible to have all triangles acute.Yes, in this specific case, due to the constraints of being on two parallel lines and the careful arrangement, it is possible. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{122500}.Final Answerboxed{122500}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of acute-angled triangles formed by 50 points on each of two parallel lines (a) and (b), we need to consider the conditions under which a triangle with vertices on these lines is acute. 1. Triangle Formation: Any triangle must have vertices on both lines. This can be either two points on line (a) and one on line (b), or two points on line (b) and one on line (a).2. Acute Triangle Conditions: For a triangle to be acute, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This can be achieved by ensuring the distance between the two lines (denoted (h)) is sufficiently large and the points are arranged appropriately.3. Arrangement of Points: By interleaving the points on the two lines and setting the distance (h) such that the distance between any two points on one line is less than (2h), we ensure that all angles in the triangles formed are acute. 4. Verification: For any two points on one line and one point on the other line, the distance between the two points on the same line is less than (2h), ensuring the angle opposite the longest side (on the other line) is acute. Additionally, the points on the other line are positioned such that the remaining angles are also acute.5. Total Number of Triangles: The total number of triangles is calculated as:   [   2 times binom{50}{2} times 50 = 2 times 1225 times 50 = 122500   ]By carefully arranging the points and choosing an optimal distance (h), all triangles formed can be acute. Thus, the maximum number of acute-angled triangles is:[boxed{122500}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>Obviously, the maximum is achieved when the points on both lines are sufficiently close, so that each segment with marked ends on one of the lines is seen from any point on the other line at an acute angle. Let&#39;s paint the points on one of the lines blue, and the projections of the points of the second line onto this line - red. Now the problem can be reformulated as follows.On a line, there are 50 blue and 50 red points. Find the maximum possible number of triples of points, in which the middle one is of one color, and the extreme ones are of another. Let A_{1}, ldots, A_{50}, B_{1}, ldots, B_{50} be the red and blue points, ordered from left to right. Consider a pair of adjacent points A_{i} and B_{j}. If A_{i} lies to the left of B_{j}, then these points form a good triple with points B_{1}, ldots, B_{j-1} and A_{i+1}, ldots, A_{50}, that is, 49+(j-i) good triples. If i&gt;j, we can swap A_{i} and B_{j} to increase the number of such triples, while the other good triples will remain good. Therefore, the optimal arrangement will be such that each point A_{i} lies to the right of B_{i-1} but to the left of B_{i+1} (the order of points A_{i} and B_{i} can be arbitrary). In particular, the optimal arrangement will be achieved by alternating the colors of the points.In this case, the number of good triples with a red point in the middle is 1 cdot 49+2 cdot 48+ldots+49 cdot 1=50(1+2+ldots+49)+1^{2}+2^{2}+ldots+49^{2}=1 / 2502 cdot 49-1 / 649 cdot 50 cdot 99=1 / 649 cdot 50 cdot 51=20825. There are as many good triples with a blue point in the middle.## Answer41650.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95d0d1ff data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review" data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review-title" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>❓:</span>section*{Problem 1}(a) Each of (mathrm{x}_{1}, ldots, mathrm{x}_{mathrm{n}}) is (-1,0) or 1 .

Let me start with part (a). The question is: Each of x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ is -1, 0, or 1. What is the minimal possible value of the sum of all x_i x_j where 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n? Hmm, interesting. Let&#39;s try to break this down.First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have variables x₁ through xₙ, each can be -1, 0, or 1. We need to choose values for these variables such that the sum of all products x_i x_j for i &lt; j is minimized. So, the sum is over all pairs, right? Each pair of distinct indices i and j, with i less than j, multiplied together, and we sum those products. The goal is to find the smallest possible value of that sum.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe there&#39;s a clever way to express this sum in terms of something simpler. I remember that the sum over all pairs x_i x_j can be related to the square of the sum of the x_i&#39;s. Let me recall the formula:(Σx_i)² = Σx_i² + 2Σx_i x_j for i &lt; j.Yes, that&#39;s right. Because when you square the sum, you get all the terms x_i² and twice the products x_i x_j for i ≠ j. So, rearranging that, we can express the sum of products as:Σ_{i &lt; j} x_i x_j = [(Σx_i)² - Σx_i²] / 2.Okay, so if I can express the sum in terms of the square of the sum minus the sum of squares, divided by 2. Since all the x_i are -1, 0, or 1, the sum of squares Σx_i² will just be the number of non-zero x_i&#39;s, because (-1)² = 1, 0² = 0, and 1² = 1. So if we let k be the number of non-zero variables, then Σx_i² = k.Therefore, our sum becomes [(Σx_i)² - k] / 2. So we need to minimize this expression. Let me denote S = Σx_i. Then the sum we need to minimize is (S² - k)/2.So, we have variables x_i, each -1, 0, or 1. Let&#39;s say that out of the n variables, m of them are 1, p of them are -1, and the rest are 0. Then, the total sum S = m - p, and the number of non-zero variables k = m + p. So substituting into the expression:[(m - p)² - (m + p)] / 2.Therefore, our problem reduces to choosing integers m and p (with m, p ≥ 0 and m + p ≤ n) such that [(m - p)² - (m + p)] / 2 is minimized.So, we need to minimize [(m - p)² - (m + p)] / 2. Let&#39;s call this expression E.Our variables m and p are non-negative integers, and m + p ≤ n. Let me see if I can find the minimal E.First, note that (m - p)² is (m + p)² - 4mp. Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe I can set d = m - p and s = m + p. Then, since m and p are non-negative integers, s is a non-negative integer such that s ≤ n, and d is an integer such that |d| ≤ s. Also, s and d must have the same parity, because m = (s + d)/2 and p = (s - d)/2 must be integers.Therefore, E can be written as (d² - s)/2. So our goal is to minimize (d² - s)/2, given that s is between 0 and n, d is between -s and s, and s and d have the same parity.So, given s, what is the minimal value of (d² - s)/2? For each s, the minimal value of d² is as small as possible. Since d must have the same parity as s, the minimal |d| is 0 if s is even, and 1 if s is odd.Wait, if s is even, then d can be 0, so d² - s = 0 - s = -s, so E = -s/2.If s is odd, then the minimal |d| is 1, so d² - s = 1 - s, so E = (1 - s)/2.Therefore, for each s, the minimal E is:- If s is even: -s/2- If s is odd: (1 - s)/2Therefore, to minimize E, we need to choose s as large as possible (since for even s, E = -s/2 which decreases as s increases, and for odd s, E = (1 - s)/2 which also decreases as s increases). So the minimal E occurs when s is as large as possible (i.e., s = n, if possible) and d is as close to 0 as possible (to minimize d² - s).Wait, but let&#39;s check:Suppose we take s = n. Then, all variables are non-zero. Then, for s = n, if n is even, then d can be 0, so E = -n/2.If n is odd, then the minimal |d| is 1, so E = (1 - n)/2.But if s is less than n, say s = n - 1, then if n -1 is even, E = -(n -1)/2, which is larger (less negative) than -n/2. Similarly, if n is odd, then s = n -1 is even, E = -(n -1)/2, which is better than (1 - n)/2 = (-n +1)/2. Wait, no, (1 - n)/2 is (-n +1)/2, which is the same as -(n -1)/2. So same value.Wait, so if s = n (all variables non-zero), then depending on parity, E is either -n/2 (if even) or (-n +1)/2 (if odd). If instead, s = n -1 (one variable is zero), then if n -1 is even, E = -(n -1)/2. If n -1 is odd, then E = (-n +2)/2. Wait, maybe not. Let me compute:If s = n -1, then if s is even (so n -1 even, n odd), then E = -s/2 = -(n -1)/2.If s is odd (so n -1 odd, n even), then E = (1 - s)/2 = (1 - (n -1))/2 = (2 - n)/2.Compare this to s = n. If n is even, then E = -n/2. If n is odd, E = (-n +1)/2.So for example, if n is even:s = n: E = -n/2s = n -1 (which is odd): E = (2 - n)/2Comparing -n/2 vs (2 - n)/2. For even n, which is smaller?If n is even, say n = 4:s =4: E = -2s=3: E=(2 -4)/2 = -1So -2 is smaller. So s =n is better.If n is odd, say n=5:s=5 (odd): E=(1 -5)/2 = -2s=4 (even): E= -4/2 = -2Same value. Hmm.Wait, so for odd n, s = n gives E = (-n +1)/2, and s = n -1 (even) gives E = - (n -1)/2. Wait, but (-n +1)/2 is equal to - (n -1)/2. So same value.Therefore, for odd n, whether we take s = n (all variables non-zero, sum d =1 or -1) or s = n -1 (one variable zero, sum d=0), the minimal E is the same.Therefore, in either case, whether n is even or odd, the minimal E is - floor(n/2). Wait, let&#39;s see:Wait, for even n:E = -n/2For odd n:E = (-n +1)/2 = - (n -1)/2Which is equivalent to - floor(n/2). Hmm, but actually, for odd n, (n -1)/2 is equal to floor(n/2). For example, n=5: (5-1)/2=2, floor(5/2)=2.Similarly, for n=6: floor(6/2)=3, which is 6/2=3.So the minimal E is - floor(n/2). So regardless of parity, the minimal value is - floor(n/2).Wait, but let me check:Take n=2. Then, minimal E is -1 (s=2, d=0, E=(0 -2)/2=-1). Alternatively, s=1: E=(1 -1)/2=0. So indeed, minimal is -1.For n=3:If s=3, d=1 or -1, E=(1 -3)/2=(-2)/2=-1.If s=2, which is even, d=0, E=(0 -2)/2=-1. So same value.So for n=3, minimal E is -1, which is -floor(3/2) = -1.Similarly, n=4: E=-2, which is -floor(4/2)=-2.n=5: E=-2, which is -floor(5/2)=-2.Therefore, indeed, the minimal possible value of the sum is -floor(n/2). So the answer is -⌊n/2⌋. But wait, let me confirm with an example.Take n=4. Variables can be two 1s and two -1s. Then sum S=0, k=4. Then (0² -4)/2 = (-4)/2=-2. Which matches. If we have three 1s and one -1, then S=2, k=4. Then (4 -4)/2=0. Which is worse. Alternatively, three -1s and one 1, S=-2, same result. If all 1s, sum S=4, (16 -4)/2=6. Which is much higher. So the minimal is indeed -2.Similarly, for n=5. If we have three 1s and two -1s, sum S=1, k=5. Then (1 -5)/2=-2. If we have two 1s and two -1s and one 0, sum S=0, k=4. Then (0 -4)/2=-2. So same value. So indeed, minimal E is -2, which is -floor(5/2)=-2.Therefore, the minimal possible value is -⌊n/2⌋. So that&#39;s part (a). Therefore, the answer is boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }.Wait, but the problem says &quot;the minimal possible value of the sum&quot;. So I need to confirm that this is indeed the minimal. Let me check for n=1. Wait, n=1: there are no pairs, so the sum is 0. But floor(1/2)=0, so the answer would be 0, which is correct.n=2: floor(2/2)=1, so answer is -1. As in the example above, two variables: one 1 and one -1. The sum is (1)(-1) = -1, which matches. If both 1s: sum is 1*1=1. Both -1s: sum is 1. One 1 and one 0: sum is 0. So indeed, minimal is -1.Okay, that seems to check out.Now part (b): Is the answer the same if the x_i are real numbers satisfying 0 ≤ |x_i| ≤ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n?So now, instead of x_i being restricted to -1, 0, or 1, they can be any real numbers between -1 and 1. So we need to determine if the minimal possible value of the sum Σ_{i &lt; j} x_i x_j is still -floor(n/2), or if it can be lower.First, let&#39;s recall that in part (a), the minimal sum was achieved by having as many pairs as possible with product -1, but due to the constraints of the variables being -1, 0, or 1, the best we could do was have half of the non-zero variables as 1 and half as -1 (as close as possible), leading to the sum of products being -floor(n/2). But if the variables can take any real values between -1 and 1, perhaps we can get a lower sum.Let me consider the same expression as before. The sum Σ_{i &lt; j} x_i x_j can be written as [ (Σx_i)^2 - Σx_i² ] / 2. So our goal is to minimize this expression. Since the x_i are real numbers with |x_i| ≤ 1, so each x_i² ≤ 1.Let’s denote S = Σx_i, and Q = Σx_i². Then the expression becomes (S² - Q)/2. We need to minimize (S² - Q)/2.Given that each x_i² ≤ 1, so Q ≤ n. But since we want to minimize (S² - Q)/2, which is equivalent to (S²)/2 - Q/2. To minimize this, we need to minimize S² and maximize Q. Because S² is subtracted by Q, so maximizing Q (which is subtracted) would decrease the total expression, but also, minimizing S² would help. However, these two goals might conflict.Wait, let&#39;s think again. The expression is (S² - Q)/2. So to minimize this, we need to minimize S² and maximize Q. So maximize Q (so set each x_i² as large as possible, i.e., |x_i|=1) and minimize S² (so set the sum S as close to 0 as possible). But if we set all |x_i|=1, then Q = n, and S² is (sum x_i)^2. If we can make S as small as possible, then S² is minimized. The minimal S² when all |x_i|=1 is achieved when half are 1 and half are -1, as in part (a). So then S=0 if n even, S=1 or -1 if n odd, so S² =0 or 1. Then (S² - Q)/2 = (0 - n)/2 = -n/2 if n even, or (1 -n)/2 if n odd. Which is exactly the same as in part (a). But if we allow some x_i to be smaller in absolute value, perhaps we can make S even smaller, but then Q would also be smaller. Wait, but if we set some variables to 0, that would decrease Q but allow S to be smaller. But in that case, maybe (S² - Q)/2 could be lower?Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Let n=2. In part (a), minimal sum is -1. If we let x₁ and x₂ be real numbers between -1 and 1. The sum is x₁x₂. To minimize this, set x₁=1 and x₂=-1, giving -1. So same as part (a). Alternatively, if we set x₁=1 and x₂=-0.5, then the product is -0.5, which is higher (less negative). So the minimal is still -1.Wait, but perhaps for larger n? Let&#39;s take n=3. In part (a), minimal sum is -1. If we set two variables to 1 and one to -1, sum S=1, Q=3, so (1 -3)/2=-1. If instead, set all variables to 1 and two variables to some a and -a, but wait, variables can be real numbers. Wait, maybe set two variables to 1 and one variable to -1. But that&#39;s the same as part (a). Alternatively, set two variables to 1 and one variable to some t where |t| ≤1. Let&#39;s see:Let x₁ = x₂=1, x₃ = t. Then the sum is x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃ = 1*1 +1*t +1*t =1 + 2t. To minimize this, set t=-1, so sum becomes 1 -2 = -1. Same as before.Alternatively, set x₁ = a, x₂ = b, x₃ = c, all in [-1,1]. The sum is ab + ac + bc. How to minimize this. Maybe set a = b =1, c=-1: sum is -1. Alternatively, set a=1, b= -1, c=0: sum is (1*(-1) +1*0 + (-1)*0) = -1. So same result. Alternatively, set a=1, b=1, c=-0.5: sum is 1*1 +1*(-0.5) +1*(-0.5) =1 -1 =0. Not better.Alternatively, set a=1, b=-1, c=0: sum is -1 +0 +0 = -1. So same as before. So seems like even with real numbers, the minimal is still -1 for n=3. So same as part (a).Wait, perhaps for even n? Let&#39;s take n=4. In part (a), minimal sum is -2. If we set two variables to 1 and two to -1: sum of products is (2 choose 2)*1*1 + (2 choose 2)*(-1)*(-1) + (2*2) terms of 1*(-1). Wait, actually, the sum is Σ_{i &lt; j} x_i x_j. If two 1s and two -1s:Total pairs: C(4,2)=6. The pairs between the 1s: C(2,2)=1, product 1*1=1. Pairs between -1s: C(2,2)=1, product (-1)*(-1)=1. Pairs between 1s and -1s: 2*2=4, products 1*(-1)=-1. So total sum:1 +1 +4*(-1)= -2.If we instead use real numbers, can we get lower? For example, set all variables to 1 except one variable set to a value t. Wait, no, maybe set variables in a way that more products are negative. Wait, but with real numbers, perhaps we can have variables that are not just -1, 0, or 1. Let me think.Let’s consider variables x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄. Let’s set x₁ = x₂ = a and x₃ = x₄ = -b, where a, b are in [0,1]. Then the sum of products would be:C(2,2) pairs among the first two: a²C(2,2) pairs among the last two: b²Pairs between first two and last two: 2*2=4 terms, each -abSo total sum: a² + b² -4abTo minimize this expression: a² + b² -4ab.We can consider a = b due to symmetry. Let a = b, then the expression becomes 2a² -4a² = -2a². To minimize this, we want to maximize a². Since a ≤1, set a=1. Then the sum is -2*1= -2. Which is the same as the discrete case.Alternatively, set a ≠ b. Let’s take partial derivatives to find minima. Let’s consider a and b as real variables in [0,1]. The function is f(a,b)=a² + b² -4ab.Compute partial derivatives:df/da = 2a -4bdf/db = 2b -4aSet to zero:2a -4b =0 =&gt; a=2b2b -4a =0 =&gt; b=2aFrom first equation: a=2b. Substitute into second equation: b=2*(2b)=4b =&gt; -3b=0 =&gt; b=0.Thus, critical point at a=0, b=0. But that gives f(0,0)=0, which is not minimal.Alternatively, check boundaries. If a=1, then f(1,b)=1 + b² -4b. To minimize this over b in [0,1], take derivative: 2b -4. Set to zero: b=2, which is outside the interval. So minimal at b=1: f(1,1)=1 +1 -4= -2.Similarly, if b=1, f(a,1)=a² +1 -4a. Derivative: 2a -4, set to zero: a=2, outside. So minimal at a=1: same result.Alternatively, if a=0, f(0,b)=b². Minimal at b=0: 0.Similarly, b=0: f(a,0)=a². Minimal at 0.Thus, the minimal on the boundary is -2, achieved at a=b=1. So same as discrete case.Therefore, even with real numbers, the minimal sum is -2 for n=4.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s another configuration. Suppose we set all variables to some value between -1 and 1. Let’s suppose all variables are set to t. Then the sum is C(n,2) t². To minimize this, set t=0. Then sum is 0. But we want to minimize it, so set t as negative as possible? Wait, but if all variables are t, then the sum is C(n,2) t², which is non-negative. So the minimal would be 0. But that&#39;s not helpful.Alternatively, set some variables to a and others to b. For example, suppose we set k variables to a and n -k variables to b. Then the sum would be [C(k,2) a² + C(n -k,2) b² + k(n -k)ab]. To minimize this.But this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that in the case where we can set variables to real numbers, maybe we can make the sum S = Σx_i as close to 0 as possible while maximizing Q = Σx_i². Wait, but in our previous analysis, the minimal (S² - Q)/2 was achieved when Q is maximized (i.e., all |x_i|=1) and S is minimized. Since Q is maximized when all |x_i|=1, and S is minimized (closest to 0) by balancing 1s and -1s. Therefore, even when allowing real numbers, we cannot get a better (lower) value than in the discrete case.Wait, but is that true? Wait, suppose n is even. If we set half of the variables to 1 and half to -1, we get S=0, Q=n. Then (0 -n)/2 = -n/2. If we set all variables to 0, then Q=0, S=0, so sum is (0 -0)/2=0, which is worse. If we set some variables to less than 1, maybe we can make S² - Q smaller?Wait, let&#39;s take n=2. If we set x₁ =1 and x₂=-1, sum is -1. If we set x₁ =a and x₂=-a, then the sum is -a². To minimize this, we need to maximize a². So set a=1, giving -1. So same result.If n=4, set two variables to a and two to -a. Then sum is C(2,2)a² + C(2,2)a² + 4*(-a²) = 2a² -4a² = -2a². To minimize, maximize a². So set a=1, giving -2. Same as before.Alternatively, suppose for n=3, set two variables to a and one to -b. Then sum is C(2,2)a² + 2*(-a b) + 0 (if the third variable is set to 0). Wait, no, all variables are set: two to a and one to -b. So sum would be:Pairs among the two a&#39;s: a²Pairs between the two a&#39;s and -b: 2 terms of -a bPair between the two a&#39;s and -b: wait, no. Wait, for three variables x₁=a, x₂=a, x₃=-b.The pairs are x₁x₂ =a², x₁x₃= -ab, x₂x₃= -ab. So total sum: a² -2ab.To minimize this, with a, b in [0,1]. Take derivative with respect to a: 2a -2b. With respect to b: -2a.But since we can choose a and b. To minimize a² -2ab, set a as small as possible and b as large as possible. Wait, but if a is small, but b is multiplied by a. Let me see:Suppose we set a=1 (max), then we have 1 -2b. To minimize this, set b=1, giving 1 -2= -1. Which is the same as part (a).Alternatively, set a=0, then sum is 0. Not better. If we set a=0.5, then b=1, sum is 0.25 -1= -0.75, which is worse than -1.Therefore, even with real numbers, minimal is -1 for n=3.So perhaps the minimal is the same in both cases. Therefore, the answer to part (b) is yes, the minimal value is the same.But wait, wait. Let me think of a different configuration. Suppose for n=3, set all variables to -1/2. Then the sum is C(3,2)*( (-1/2)^2 )=3*(1/4)=3/4. That&#39;s positive. Not helpful. Alternatively, set two variables to 1 and one variable to t. Then sum is C(2,2)*1 + 2*(1*t) =1 +2t. To minimize, set t=-1: sum=1 -2= -1. Same as before.Alternatively, set one variable to 1, one to a, and one to b. Then sum is a + b + ab. To minimize this. Hmm, this is getting complicated, but I think regardless of how you set variables, the minimal seems to be -1 for n=3. Similarly, for even n, the minimal is -n/2.Wait, but maybe there&#39;s a way to set variables such that more products are negative. But with real numbers, each product x_i x_j can be as low as -1*1=-1, but if x_i and x_j are both between -1 and 1, the minimal product is -1, achieved when one is 1 and the other is -1. However, if you set variables to be fractions, say x_i = a and x_j = -a, then their product is -a², which is greater than or equal to -1. So actually, the minimal product for a pair is -1, same as in the discrete case.Therefore, even with real numbers, the minimal product for each pair is -1, but you can&#39;t have products less than -1. However, the total sum is the sum of all pairs. So the minimal total sum would be the number of pairs times -1, but you can&#39;t have all pairs being -1 because variables are shared among pairs. For example, if you have two variables x₁ and x₂, setting one to 1 and the other to -1 gives their product as -1. If you have three variables, you can set two to 1 and one to -1, but then the products between the 1s are positive, so the total sum isn&#39;t all -1.Therefore, it&#39;s the same problem as in the discrete case. The minimal sum is achieved by balancing as many pairs as possible with -1, but due to overlapping variables, the minimal sum ends up being the same as in the discrete case. Therefore, even with real numbers between -1 and 1, the minimal sum is the same as when restricted to -1, 0, 1. Hence, the answer to part (b) is yes.But wait, let me think again. Suppose for even n, instead of setting half variables to 1 and half to -1, could we set variables to some other values that allow more negative products? For example, set variables in a way that each pair has a slightly negative product, but many pairs. However, due to the constraints of variables being in [-1,1], the minimal product per pair is -1, same as discrete case. So even if you could set variables to different values, the most negative each pair can contribute is -1, just like before. Therefore, the total minimal sum should be the same.Alternatively, perhaps distribute the values so that the sum S is smaller than in the discrete case, allowing (S² - Q)/2 to be smaller. For example, suppose n=4. If in the discrete case, S=0 and Q=4, giving (0 -4)/2=-2. If in the real case, could we set variables such that S is small and Q is large? Wait, but Q is maximized when all |x_i|=1. If we set variables to 1 and -1, Q=4. If we set variables to other values, Q would be less. For example, if we set two variables to 1 and two to -1, but slightly less than 1, say 0.9 and -0.9. Then Q=2*(0.81) + 2*(0.81)=3.24, which is less than 4. Then S=0, so (0 -3.24)/2=-1.62, which is worse (higher) than -2. So even if you make S=0, if Q is smaller, the total sum is worse. Therefore, the minimal is achieved when Q is as large as possible, which is when |x_i|=1.Therefore, even in the real case, the minimal is achieved by setting as many variables as possible to ±1 with equal numbers to make S as small as possible. Therefore, the minimal value is the same as in the discrete case. Hence, the answer to part (b) is yes.Final Answer(a) The minimal possible value is boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }.(b) Yes, the answer is the same. The minimal value is also boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }.&lt;/think&gt;To solve part (a), we need to find the minimal possible value of the sum of all (x_i x_j) for (1 leq i &lt; j leq n) where each (x_i) is -1, 0, or 1. We use the identity:[left( sum_{i=1}^n x_i right)^2 = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq i &lt; j leq n} x_i x_j]Rearranging, we get:[sum_{1 leq i &lt; j leq n} x_i x_j = frac{1}{2} left( left( sum_{i=1}^n x_i right)^2 - sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 right)]Let (S = sum_{i=1}^n x_i) and (k = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2). Since (x_i) can be -1, 0, or 1, (k) is the number of non-zero (x_i). We need to minimize (frac{1}{2}(S^2 - k)). For the minimal value, we balance the number of 1s and -1s to make (S) as small as possible. If (n) is even, the minimal (S) is 0 with (k = n). If (n) is odd, the minimal (S) is 1 or -1 with (k = n). This leads to:- For even (n): (frac{1}{2}(0 - n) = -frac{n}{2})- For odd (n): (frac{1}{2}(1 - n) = -frac{n-1}{2})Thus, the minimal value is (-leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor).For part (b), we consider real numbers (x_i) with (0 leq |x_i| leq 1). The expression to minimize remains (frac{1}{2}(S^2 - Q)) where (Q = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2). Maximizing (Q) (setting (|x_i| = 1)) and minimizing (S) (balancing 1s and -1s) yields the same result as in part (a). Therefore, the minimal value is the same. Final Answer(a) The minimal possible value is (boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }).(b) Yes, the answer is the same. The minimal value is also (boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle part (a) of this problem. So, we have variables x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ, each of which can be -1, 0, or 1. We need to find the minimal possible value of the sum of all products x_i x_j where 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let&#39;s recall that the sum of x_i x_j for all i &lt; j is related to the square of the sum of the x_i&#39;s. Specifically, I remember that (x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ)² = sum of x_i² + 2 * sum of x_i x_j for i &lt; j. That&#39;s a useful identity. So if I let S = x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ, then S² = sum_{i=1}^n x_i² + 2 * sum_{i&lt;j} x_i x_j. Therefore, the sum we&#39;re interested in, let&#39;s call it Q, is equal to (S² - sum x_i²)/2. So, Q = (S² - sum x_i²)/2.Our goal is to minimize Q. Since each x_i can be -1, 0, or 1, the sum x_i² for each term is either 0 or 1. Specifically, x_i² is 1 if x_i is -1 or 1, and 0 if x_i is 0. So sum x_i² is just equal to the number of non-zero x_i&#39;s. Let&#39;s denote m as the number of non-zero terms. Then sum x_i² = m. Therefore, Q = (S² - m)/2.So, we need to minimize (S² - m)/2. Since m is the number of non-zero x_i&#39;s, and each non-zero x_i is either -1 or 1, S is the sum of m terms each ±1. Therefore, S can be any integer from -m to m with the same parity as m. Because the sum of m ±1&#39;s will be an integer with the same parity as m. For example, if m is even, S is even; if m is odd, S is odd.Therefore, Q = (S² - m)/2. To minimize Q, we need to choose m and S such that S is as small as possible given m, since S² is subtracted by m and then divided by 2. Wait, actually, S² is a positive term, so we want to minimize S² while also considering the term -m. Hmm, so it&#39;s a balance between making m as large as possible (which would subtract more) and S² as small as possible. But m can&#39;t be too large if we have to keep S² small. Let&#39;s think.Wait, actually, perhaps we can consider that Q = (S² - m)/2. So, to minimize Q, we need to minimize S² - m. So, for a given m, the minimal value of S² is (if we can make S as small as possible). The minimal |S| is 0 if m is even, and 1 if m is odd. Therefore, for a given m, the minimal S² is 0 if m even, 1 if m odd. Therefore, the minimal S² - m for given m is -m if m even, and 1 - m if m odd. Therefore, to minimize S² - m, we can set S² as small as possible, which would give us either -m (if m even) or 1 - m (if m odd). Therefore, the minimal S² - m is -m when m is even and 1 - m when m is odd. So then, the minimal Q would be (-m)/2 if m even, and (1 - m)/2 if m odd. So, Q_min = -m/2 when m even, and (1 - m)/2 when m odd.Therefore, we need to choose m (number of non-zero x_i&#39;s) such that this expression is minimized. Let&#39;s note that m can range from 0 to n. But if m is 0, then all x_i are 0, so Q = 0. But we need to find the minimal value, so maybe negative values are possible. Let&#39;s see.For even m: Q = -m/2. So as m increases, Q becomes more negative. For odd m: Q = (1 - m)/2. So for m odd, as m increases, Q decreases. So, the minimal Q would be achieved when m is as large as possible (either even or odd). But if we can have m as large as possible, with even m, then Q = -m/2. If m is odd, then Q = (1 - m)/2. Let&#39;s compare these two for consecutive m&#39;s. For example, take m even: m = 2k. Then Q = -k. For m odd: m = 2k + 1. Then Q = (1 - (2k + 1))/2 = (-2k)/2 = -k. So for m even and m odd adjacent values (like 2k and 2k +1), the minimal Q is the same. Wait, so for m even, Q = -m/2; for m odd, Q = -floor(m/2). So, for both even and odd m, the minimal Q is -floor(m/2). Wait, but maybe I need to check.Wait, if m is even, Q = -m/2. If m is odd, Q = (1 - m)/2 = (-m +1)/2. So for example, m = 2k: Q = -k. m = 2k +1: Q = (-2k -1 +1)/2 = (-2k)/2 = -k. So actually, both even and odd m give Q = -k where k = floor(m/2). Wait, so regardless of whether m is even or odd, Q is equal to -floor(m/2). Hmm, interesting. Therefore, Q is minimized when m is maximized. Because floor(m/2) increases as m increases, so -floor(m/2) decreases (becomes more negative) as m increases. Therefore, to minimize Q, we need to maximize m. The maximum possible m is n, when all x_i are non-zero. But m is the number of non-zero x_i&#39;s, so if we set all x_i to be either 1 or -1, then m = n. Then, we need to set S as small as possible.But when m = n, then S is the sum of n terms each ±1. The minimal possible S² is 0 if n is even (since we can have equal numbers of 1&#39;s and -1&#39;s) or 1 if n is odd. Therefore, if we set m = n, then Q = (S² - n)/2. So if n is even, Q = (0 - n)/2 = -n/2. If n is odd, Q = (1 - n)/2.But wait, the problem states that each x_i is -1, 0, or 1. So, if we set some x_i to 0, we can decrease m. But earlier, we thought that increasing m would lead to a lower Q. However, perhaps there&#39;s a balance here. Let me re-examine.Wait, if we set some variables to 0, we decrease m, which might make S smaller, but also decrease the term -m. So maybe it&#39;s possible that by setting some variables to 0, even though m decreases, the S² term might decrease more, leading to a lower Q.Wait, let&#39;s test this with a small example. Let&#39;s take n=3. If we set all variables to 1 or -1. Let&#39;s say two 1&#39;s and one -1. Then S = 2 -1 = 1. Then sum x_i x_j = (1^2 - sum x_i²)/2 = (1 - 3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Alternatively, if we set one variable to 0 and two variables to 1 and -1. Let&#39;s say two variables: 1 and -1, and one 0. Then S = 0. sum x_i x_j = (0 - 2)/2 = -1. So same result. Alternatively, if we set two variables to 0 and one variable to 1. Then S = 1. sum x_i x_j = (1 -1)/2 = 0. So higher. So in this case, setting one variable to 0 and the other two to 1 and -1 gives the same minimal sum as setting all variables to non-zero. So in n=3, minimal Q is -1. If all variables are non-zero, Q = (1 -3)/2 = -1, same as when one variable is zero. So maybe it&#39;s possible that for some n, setting some variables to 0 can give the same minimal Q as setting all variables to non-zero.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal Q is always achieved when all variables are non-zero. Wait, let&#39;s check n=2. If n=2, set both to 1 and -1. Then sum x_i x_j = ( (1 -1)^2 - 2)/2 = (0 - 2)/2 = -1. Alternatively, set one to 0 and the other to 1. Then sum x_i x_j = 0. So the minimal is -1 when both are non-zero. So for n=2, minimal Q is -1. If n=1, the sum is 0, since there are no pairs.Another example: n=4. If all variables are non-zero. Let&#39;s set two 1&#39;s and two -1&#39;s. Then S=0. sum x_i x_j = (0 -4)/2 = -2. Alternatively, if we set three variables to 1 and one to -1. Then S=3 -1=2. sum x_i x_j=(4 -4)/2=0. So worse. Alternatively, set two variables to 1 and two to 0. Then sum x_i x_j = (2^2 -2)/2=(4 -2)/2=1. So higher. If we set one 1, one -1, and two 0&#39;s. Then S=0. sum x_i x_j=(0 -2)/2=-1. Which is worse than -2. So minimal when all non-zero. So for n=4, minimal Q is -2.Similarly, if n=5, the minimal Q would be when we have as balanced as possible. For n=5, m=5 (all non-zero). Then S must be ±1. So Q=(1 -5)/2= -2. If we set four non-zero variables (m=4), which is even. Then S can be 0. Then Q=(0 -4)/2=-2. So same as when m=5. Wait, so for n=5, if we set four variables to ±1 (balanced as two 1&#39;s and two -1&#39;s) and one variable to 0, then Q=(0 -4)/2=-2. Which is the same as when m=5. So in this case, we can achieve the same minimal Q with fewer non-zero variables.Hmm, so maybe for odd n, setting m = n-1 (even) gives Q=(0 - (n-1))/2= -(n-1)/2. While setting m=n (odd) gives Q=(1 -n)/2. Comparing these two: -(n-1)/2 vs (1 -n)/2. Wait, they are the same. -(n-1)/2 = ( -n +1)/2 = (1 -n)/2. So same value. Therefore, for odd n, whether we set m=n or m=n-1, we get the same Q. So, in that case, it doesn&#39;t matter. But perhaps when n is even, m=n (even) gives Q=-n/2, which is lower than if we set m=n-1 (odd), which would give Q=(1 - (n -1))/2=( -n +2)/2= -n/2 +1. So worse.Therefore, summarizing:If n is even:- Set m = n (all variables non-zero), balanced with n/2 1&#39;s and n/2 -1&#39;s. Then S=0, Q=-n/2.If n is odd:- Set m = n (all variables non-zero), balanced as (n-1)/2 1&#39;s and (n+1)/2 -1&#39;s (or vice versa), leading to S= -1 or 1. Then Q=(1 -n)/2. Alternatively, set m = n -1 (even), with (n-1)/2 1&#39;s and (n-1)/2 -1&#39;s, and one 0. Then S=0, Q=-(n-1)/2. However, (1 -n)/2 = -(n -1)/2. So same result. Therefore, for odd n, both approaches give the same minimal Q.Therefore, regardless of whether n is even or odd, the minimal Q is -floor(n/2). Wait:Wait, for even n: Q=-n/2. For odd n: Q=-(n-1)/2. Which is equivalent to -floor(n/2). Because floor(n/2) is n/2 when n even, and (n-1)/2 when n odd. So yes, the minimal Q is -floor(n/2). But wait, let&#39;s check for n=3: floor(3/2)=1, so -1. Which matches our previous example. For n=5: floor(5/2)=2, so -2. Which also matches. For n=4: floor(4/2)=2, so -2. Correct.Therefore, the minimal possible value of the sum Q is -floor(n/2). But wait, but in our previous example with n=5, both m=5 and m=4 give Q=-2, which is -floor(5/2). Similarly for n=3, Q=-1. So yes, the minimal Q is -floor(n/2). Wait, but is this correct?Wait, hold on. For n=3, the minimal Q is -1, which is -floor(3/2)=-1. For n=4, -2, which is -floor(4/2)=-2. For n=5, -2, which is -floor(5/2)=-2. So yes, that&#39;s correct.But wait, in the case where we can set variables to 0, do we ever get a lower Q? For example, take n=5. If we set all 5 variables to non-zero, Q=(1 -5)/2= -2. If we set 4 variables to non-zero (balanced as 2 and 2), then Q=(0 -4)/2=-2. So same. If we set 3 variables to non-zero, balanced as 1 and 2, then S= -1, Q=(1 -3)/2=-1. Worse. So no, we don&#39;t get a lower Q by decreasing m. Similarly, for n=6, set all 6 variables to non-zero, balanced as 3 and 3, Q=(0 -6)/2=-3. If we set 5 variables to non-zero, then Q=(1 -5)/2=-2, which is worse. So indeed, to minimize Q, we need to maximize m (the number of non-zero variables). But when m is maximized (m = n), but if n is odd, we can also set m = n -1 (even) and get the same Q. So in any case, the minimal Q is -floor(n/2).Therefore, the answer to part (a) is -floor(n/2). But floor(n/2) is the same as ⎣n/2⎦. However, since the problem asks for the minimal value, which is -floor(n/2), but in mathematical notation, floor(n/2) can be written as ⎣n/2⎦. But depending on whether n is even or odd, the answer is -n/2 if even, and -(n-1)/2 if odd. However, both can be expressed as -floor(n/2).But let&#39;s verify with another example. Let&#39;s take n=1. Then there are no pairs, so the sum Q is 0. But floor(1/2)=0, so -0=0. Correct. For n=2, floor(2/2)=1, so -1. Correct. For n=3, floor(3/2)=1, so -1. Correct. For n=4, floor(4/2)=2, so -2. Correct. So yes, this formula works.Therefore, the minimal possible value of the sum is -floor(n/2). But since the problem might expect an answer in terms of n, possibly expressed as -⌊n/2⌋. Alternatively, using integer division, if n is even, it&#39;s -n/2, if odd, -(n-1)/2. Both can be written as -floor(n/2). So, I think this is the answer.Now, moving to part (b): Is the answer the same if the x_i are real numbers satisfying 0 ≤ |x_i| ≤ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n?So now, instead of being restricted to -1,0,1, the x_i can be any real numbers between -1 and 1, inclusive. The question is whether the minimal possible value of the sum Q is still -floor(n/2).First, let&#39;s think about whether allowing real numbers could potentially allow a lower (more negative) sum. In part (a), the minimal Q was achieved by balancing as many pairs as possible with opposite signs, leading to cancellation in the sum S. However, with real numbers, maybe we can achieve a similar or better cancellation.Wait, but let&#39;s recall that Q = sum_{i&lt;j} x_i x_j = (S² - sum x_i²)/2. So, to minimize Q, we need to minimize (S² - sum x_i²)/2. So, equivalently, minimize S² - sum x_i².In the previous case with x_i ∈ {-1,0,1}, sum x_i² = m (number of non-zero variables). Now, with real numbers 0 ≤ |x_i| ≤1, sum x_i² is between 0 and n, since each x_i² ≤1.So, Q = (S² - sum x_i²)/2. To minimize Q, we need to minimize S² - sum x_i². Let&#39;s analyze this expression.Let’s denote t_i = x_i. Then sum x_i² = sum t_i², and S = sum t_i. So, we need to minimize ( (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i² ) / 2. Alternatively, since Q = sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j, which is equivalent to (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i² all over 2.But how can we minimize this? Let&#39;s think about the expression S² - sum t_i². Expanding S² gives sum t_i² + 2 sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j. Therefore, S² - sum t_i² = 2 sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j, so sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j = (S² - sum t_i²)/2. Therefore, to minimize sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j is equivalent to minimizing (S² - sum t_i²)/2.Given that each t_i is in [-1,1], we need to find t_i&#39;s in that interval such that (S² - sum t_i²)/2 is as small as possible.Alternatively, since we need to minimize S² - sum t_i². Let&#39;s denote that expression as E = S² - sum t_i². Our goal is to minimize E.Note that E = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i² = 2 sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j. So, we need to minimize 2 sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j, which is equivalent to minimizing sum_{i&lt;j} t_i t_j. Therefore, minimizing Q is equivalent to minimizing E/2.So, the problem reduces to minimizing E = S² - sum t_i². Let&#39;s analyze E.Expressed in terms of the variables t_i, with each |t_i| ≤1. Let&#39;s try to find the minimal E.Let’s consider that E = (sum t_i)^2 - sum t_i² = sum_{i≠j} t_i t_j.So, E is the sum of all products t_i t_j for i ≠ j.To minimize E, which is the sum over all i≠j of t_i t_j, we need to arrange the t_i&#39;s such that their products are as negative as possible. However, since t_i can be between -1 and 1, maybe setting some variables to -1 and others to 1 could create negative products. Wait, but the product t_i t_j is positive if t_i and t_j have the same sign and negative otherwise. So, to minimize E (sum of all products), we need as many negative products as possible, i.e., as many pairs of t_i and t_j with opposite signs.But in order to have as many negative products as possible, we should split the variables into two groups: one group with positive values and the other with negative values. The more pairs we have between the groups, the more negative terms we get. However, each variable can be adjusted continuously between -1 and 1, so perhaps there&#39;s a more optimal configuration.Alternatively, suppose we set k variables to a and (n -k) variables to -b, where a, b ∈ [0,1]. Then, S = k a - (n -k) b. sum t_i² = k a² + (n -k) b². Then E = (k a - (n -k) b)^2 - [k a² + (n -k) b²]. Let&#39;s compute this:E = [k² a² - 2 k (n -k) a b + (n -k)^2 b²] - [k a² + (n -k) b²]= k² a² - 2 k (n -k) a b + (n -k)^2 b² - k a² - (n -k) b²= (k² - k) a² - 2 k (n -k) a b + [(n -k)^2 - (n -k)] b²= k(k -1) a² - 2 k (n -k) a b + (n -k)(n -k -1) b²Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can consider symmetry. Suppose we set half of the variables to a and half to -a. If n is even, set n/2 variables to a and n/2 variables to -a. Then S = 0, sum t_i² = n a². Therefore, E = 0 - n a² = -n a². To minimize E (make it as small as possible), set a as large as possible, i.e., a=1. Then E = -n. Therefore, Q = E/2 = -n/2. Which matches the discrete case when n is even.If n is odd, we can set (n-1)/2 variables to a, (n+1)/2 variables to -a (or vice versa). Then S = [(n-1)/2 a - (n+1)/2 a] = (-a). sum t_i² = (n-1)/2 a² + (n+1)/2 a² = n a². Therefore, E = (-a)^2 - n a² = a² - n a² = - (n -1) a². To minimize E, set a=1. Then E = - (n -1). Therefore, Q = E /2 = -(n -1)/2. Which again matches the discrete case when n is odd.But wait, in the continuous case, can we do better by not setting all variables to ±1? For example, maybe balancing some variables at 1 and others at intermediate values? Let&#39;s check.Suppose n=2. If we set both variables to 1 and -1, E = (0)^2 - (1 +1) = -2, Q=-1. If instead, set one variable to 1 and the other to x. Then E = (1 + x)^2 - (1 + x²) = 1 + 2x + x² -1 -x² = 2x. To minimize E, set x as small as possible, which is x=-1. Then E= -2. So same result. So no improvement.For n=3. If we set two variables to 1 and one to -1. Then E = (2 -1)^2 - (1 +1 +1) = 1 -3 = -2. Q=-1. Alternatively, set two variables to a and one to -b. Then E = (2a - b)^2 - (2a² + b²). Let&#39;s compute this:E = 4a² -4ab + b² -2a² -b² = 2a² -4ab. To minimize E, set a=1 and b=1. Then E=2 -4= -2. Alternatively, set a=1 and b as large as possible, which is 1. So same result. If we set a and b less than 1, say a=1, b=0.5, then E=2(1) -4(1)(0.5)=2 -2=0. Worse. If a=0.5, b=1, E=2*(0.25) -4*(0.5)(1)=0.5 -2= -1.5. Which is better than -2? Wait, -1.5 is greater than -2. So worse. Wait, no: we want to minimize E, so more negative is better. So -2 is better than -1.5. Therefore, setting a=1, b=1 gives lower E. Therefore, no improvement by using a&lt;1.Alternatively, set all three variables to x, x, and -y. Let&#39;s say two variables at x and one at -y. Then S=2x - y. sum t_i²=2x² + y². E=(2x - y)^2 - (2x² + y²)=4x² -4xy + y² -2x² - y²=2x² -4xy. To minimize E=2x² -4xy. With x,y ≤1. Let&#39;s see. To minimize this expression, we can set x as large as possible and y as large as possible. Because E=2x² -4xy=2x(x -2y). To minimize this, since x ≥0, we want (x -2y) to be as negative as possible. So, for a given x, maximize y. Since y ≤1, set y=1. Then E=2x² -4x*1=2x² -4x. To minimize this quadratic in x, take derivative: dE/dx=4x -4. Set to zero: x=1. Therefore, minimum at x=1, E=2 -4= -2. Same as before. Therefore, even with continuous variables, we cannot get lower than -2 for n=3. Which is the same as the discrete case.Similarly, for n=4. If we set two variables to 1 and two to -1, E=0 -4= -4. Q=-2. If we set variables to a,a,-a,-a. Then E=0 -4a². To minimize, set a=1. E=-4. Same result.Alternatively, set some variables to values between 0 and 1. Let&#39;s say three variables to a and one to -b. Then S=3a -b. sum t_i²=3a² +b². E=(3a -b)^2 -3a² -b²=9a² -6ab +b² -3a² -b²=6a² -6ab=6a(a -b). To minimize this, set a as large as possible and b as large as possible. Let a=1, b=1. Then E=6(1)(1 -1)=0. Worse. If we set a=1, b=1, but with two variables at 1 and two at -1, which gives E=-4. So better.Alternatively, set two variables to 1 and two variables to x. Then S=2 +2x. sum t_i²=2 +2x². E=(2 +2x)^2 - (2 +2x²)=4 +8x +4x² -2 -2x²=2 +8x +2x². To minimize this, take derivative: dE/dx=8 +4x. Setting to zero gives x=-2, which is outside the interval [-1,1]. Therefore, minimal occurs at x=-1. Then E=2 +8*(-1) +2*1=2 -8 +2= -4. Same as setting two 1&#39;s and two -1&#39;s. So no improvement.Therefore, it seems that for the continuous case, the minimal Q is the same as in the discrete case. Because we can set the variables to ±1 and achieve the minimal value, and allowing intermediate values does not lead to a lower sum. This suggests that the answer to part (b) is yes, the minimal value is the same.But wait, let&#39;s think again. Suppose n is even. In the continuous case, could we set all variables to some a in [-1,1] such that the sum S=0, but sum x_i² is larger than in the discrete case? Wait, no. Because if we set half to a and half to -a, then sum x_i² = n a². Then E = S² - sum x_i² =0 - n a². To minimize E, we need to maximize a², i.e., set a=1. Which gives E=-n, same as in the discrete case. Similarly, for odd n, setting (n-1)/2 variables to 1 and (n+1)/2 to -1 gives sum x_i² =n, and S=-1. Then E=1 -n. Alternatively, setting (n-1)/2 variables to a and (n+1)/2 variables to -a. Then S= [(n-1)/2 a - (n+1)/2 a] = -a. sum x_i² = (n-1)/2 a² + (n+1)/2 a² =n a². Then E=(-a)^2 -n a²= a² -n a²= - (n-1)a². To minimize E, set a=1, giving E=-(n-1). So same as discrete case.Alternatively, suppose for even n, we set some variables to 1 and others to values less than 1. Could this result in a lower E? For example, let n=2. If we set both variables to a and -a. E=0 -2a². To minimize, set a=1. If instead, set one variable to 1 and the other to x. Then E=(1 +x)^2 - (1 +x²)=2x. To minimize E, set x=-1, giving E=-2. Same as setting a=1. So no improvement.For n=3, we saw that setting variables to 1,1,-1 gives E=-2, but if we set variables to 0.5,0.5,-1, then S=0.5 +0.5 -1=0. sum x_i²=0.25 +0.25 +1=1.5. Then E=0² -1.5= -1.5. Worse than -2. So no improvement.Another approach: Maybe using more variables with negative products. For example, in the continuous case, if we set variables to alternate between positive and negative values, but less than 1. However, the product of two negatives is positive, so this might not help.Alternatively, set some variables to 1 and others to -1, but adjust some to 0. But in the discrete case, setting variables to 0 didn&#39;t help, as it decreased m and hence increased Q (since Q= -m/2 or similar). In the continuous case, setting a variable to 0 would set its square to 0, which reduces sum x_i², hence E= S² - sum x_i² would increase (since sum x_i² decreases). For example, if n=3, set two variables to 1 and one to 0. Then S=2. sum x_i²=2. E=4 -2=2. Q=1. Worse than -2.Alternatively, set one variable to 1, one to -1, and one to 0. Then S=0. sum x_i²=2. E=0 -2= -2. So Q=-1. Same as discrete case. But this is achieved by setting two variables to non-zero. However, in the continuous case, could we set the third variable to something non-zero to get a lower Q? Let&#39;s see. Let’s set x₁=1, x₂=-1, x₃=a. Then S=1 -1 +a=a. sum x_i²=1 +1 +a²=2 +a². Then E=a² - (2 +a²)= -2. So Q=-1. Regardless of a. Therefore, even if we set the third variable to a non-zero value, E remains -2. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. Let&#39;s compute:E = S² - sum x_i² = (a)^2 - (2 +a²) = a² -2 -a² = -2. So indeed, regardless of a, E=-2. Therefore, Q=-1. So even if we set the third variable to a non-zero value, we still get E=-2. However, in the discrete case, setting the third variable to 0 gives the same result. But in the continuous case, we have the same E regardless of a. So, in this case, the minimal Q is the same.But wait, if we set all three variables to non-zero, but not ±1. For example, set x₁=1, x₂=-1, x₃=0.5. Then S=1 -1 +0.5=0.5. sum x_i²=1 +1 +0.25=2.25. Then E=0.25 -2.25= -2. Q=-1. Same as before. So even with a non-zero third variable, we can&#39;t get a lower E. Therefore, it seems that in the continuous case, the minimal Q is the same as in the discrete case.Another angle: Let&#39;s consider the expression E = S² - sum x_i². For variables in [-1,1], we can write this as E = (sum x_i)^2 - sum x_i². Let&#39;s denote this as E = sum_{i≠j} x_i x_j. To minimize E, we need as many negative products as possible. However, the product x_i x_j is minimized when x_i and x_j have opposite signs. But to maximize the number of negative products, we should have as many pairs of variables with opposite signs as possible.But since the variables are continuous, we might try to split them into two groups with opposite signs. However, the optimal split would still be to have as many variables as possible in each group, similar to the discrete case. Therefore, the minimal E is achieved when half the variables are set to 1 and the other half to -1 (for even n), or (n-1)/2 to 1 and (n+1)/2 to -1 (for odd n), which gives the same minimal E as in the discrete case. Hence, the minimal Q is the same.Therefore, the answer to part (b) is yes, the minimal value is the same even when the x_i are real numbers in [-1,1].Final Answer(a) boxed{ -leftlfloor dfrac{n}{2} rightrfloor }(b) boxed{ Yes }&lt;/think&gt;To solve part (a), we need to find the minimal possible value of the sum ( Q = sum_{1 leq i &lt; j leq n} x_i x_j ) where each ( x_i ) is -1, 0, or 1. We use the identity ( (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n)^2 = sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq i &lt; j leq n} x_i x_j ). Let ( S = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n ). Then, ( Q = frac{S^2 - sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{2} ).The sum ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 ) is the number of non-zero ( x_i )&#39;s, denoted as ( m ). Thus, ( Q = frac{S^2 - m}{2} ). To minimize ( Q ), we need to minimize ( S^2 - m ). For a given ( m ), the minimal ( S^2 ) is 0 if ( m ) is even and 1 if ( m ) is odd. This leads to ( Q = -frac{m}{2} ) if ( m ) is even and ( Q = frac{1 - m}{2} ) if ( m ) is odd. The minimal value occurs when ( m ) is maximized, leading to ( -leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ).For part (b), we consider the case where ( x_i ) are real numbers with ( 0 leq |x_i| leq 1 ). The expression ( Q = frac{S^2 - sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{2} ) still holds. By setting variables to ±1 in a balanced way (maximizing ( m )), we achieve the same minimal value as in the discrete case. Thus, the minimal value remains ( -leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ).

Then we must minimize A - B. For (mathrm{n}) even, we separately minimize A and maximize B by taking half the (x) &#39;s to be +1 and half to be -1 . For (n) odd we can take ([mathrm{n} / 2]) x&#39;s to be (+1,[mathrm{n} / 2) ] to be -1 , and one to be 0 . That minimizes A and gives B one less than its maximum. That is the best we can do if we fix (mathrm{A}=0), since (mathrm{A}=0) requires an even number of (x) &#39;s to be non-zero and hence at least one to be zero. If we do not minimize A, then since its value must be an integer, its value will be at least 1 . In that case, even if B is maximized we will not get a lower total.(b) Answer: -[n/2]. For (mathrm{n}) even, the same argument works. For (mathrm{n}) odd we can clearly get -[n/2], so it remains to prove that we cannot get a smaller sum. Suppose otherwise, so that (x_{i}) is a minimal sum with sum less than -[n/2]. Let (mathrm{x}_{mathrm{n}}=mathrm{x}), then the sum is (mathrm{x}left(mathrm{x}_{1}+ldots+mathrm{x}_{mathrm{n}-1}right)+) sum of terms (mathrm{x}_{mathrm{i}} mathrm{x}_{mathrm{j}}) with (1&lt;=mathrm{i}, mathrm{j}&lt;mathrm{n}). But this is less than the sum for (mathrm{n}-1), so (mathrm{x}left(mathrm{x}_{1}+ldots+mathrm{x}_{mathrm{n}-1}right)) must be negative, and since it is minimal we must have (|x|=1). But the same argument shows that all the terms have modulus 1 . We now have a contradiction since we know that the minimum in this case is (-[n / 2]).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95d0d1ff data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review" data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review-title" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>❓:</span>Which of the following operations is correct?A: (a^{2}b^{3})^{2}=a^{4}b^{6}B: 3ab-2ab=1C: (-a)^{3}cdot a=a^{4}D: (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}</div><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of these operations is correct. Let&#39;s take each option one by one and check them. Let me start with option A.Option A: (a²b³)² = a⁴b⁶Hmm, when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. So, (a²b³)² would be (a²)² times (b³)². Then, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, (a²)² is a^(2*2) = a⁴, and similarly (b³)² is b^(3*2) = b⁶. So multiplying those together gives a⁴b⁶. That matches what&#39;s given in option A. So A seems correct. But let me check the others just to be sure.Option B: 3ab - 2ab = 1Alright, subtracting like terms here. 3ab - 2ab. Since both terms have &#39;ab&#39;, we can subtract the coefficients. 3 - 2 = 1, so it should be 1ab, which is just ab. But the answer here is written as 1. But unless ab is equal to 1, which we can&#39;t assume, this isn&#39;t necessarily true. So 3ab - 2ab simplifies to ab, not 1. Therefore, B is incorrect.Option C: (-a)³ · a = a⁴Let&#39;s break this down. First, (-a)³ means (-a) multiplied by itself three times. That would be (-a) * (-a) * (-a). Let&#39;s compute that step by step. First, (-a) * (-a) = a² (since negative times negative is positive). Then, multiply that by (-a): a² * (-a) = -a³. So (-a)³ = -a³. Then, multiply by a: -a³ * a = -a^(3+1) = -a⁴. So the left side simplifies to -a⁴, but the answer given is a⁴. So the sign is wrong. Therefore, C is incorrect.Option D: (a + b)² = a² + b²Oh, this is a classic one. The formula for (a + b)² is actually a² + 2ab + b². So expanding (a + b)², we have to use the distributive property: (a + b)(a + b) = a*a + a*b + b*a + b*b = a² + 2ab + b². The given answer in D is missing the middle term 2ab. So unless ab = 0, which we can&#39;t assume, this isn&#39;t true. Therefore, D is incorrect.So, going back through all the options:- A is correct.- B is wrong because it simplifies to ab, not 1.- C is wrong because it simplifies to -a⁴, not a⁴.- D is wrong because it&#39;s missing the 2ab term.Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Let&#39;s analyze each option step by step:Option A: ((a^2b^3)^2 = a^4b^6)When raising a product to a power, each factor is raised to that power:[(a^2b^3)^2 = (a^2)^2 cdot (b^3)^2 = a^{2 cdot 2} cdot b^{3 cdot 2} = a^4b^6]This is correct.Option B: (3ab - 2ab = 1)Subtracting like terms:[3ab - 2ab = (3 - 2)ab = 1ab = ab]The result is (ab), not (1). This is incorrect.Option C: ((-a)^3 cdot a = a^4)Calculating ((-a)^3) and then multiplying by (a):[(-a)^3 = (-a) cdot (-a) cdot (-a) = -a^3][-a^3 cdot a = -a^{3+1} = -a^4]The result is (-a^4), not (a^4). This is incorrect.Option D: ((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2)Expanding ((a + b)^2):[(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2]The term (2ab) is missing. This is incorrect.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out which of these operations is correct. There are four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to check each one step by step. Let me start with option A.Option A: (a²b³)² = a⁴b⁶Hmm, when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. So, (a²b³)² should be (a²)² times (b³)². Then, applying the power of a power rule, which is (x^m)^n = x^(m*n). So, (a²)² would be a^(2*2) = a⁴, and similarly (b³)² = b^(3*2) = b⁶. Therefore, multiplying those together gives a⁴b⁶. So, A seems correct. Let me check the other options to be sure.Option B: 3ab - 2ab = 1Alright, combining like terms here. Both terms have &#39;ab&#39; as variables. So, 3ab - 2ab is (3 - 2)ab, which is 1ab, or just ab. But the answer here is written as 1. Wait, that would mean ab = 1? But unless there&#39;s a specific value for a and b, you can&#39;t say that ab equals 1. So, unless there&#39;s some context where ab is 1, this seems incorrect. The correct simplification should be ab, not 1. So B is wrong.Option C: (-a)³ · a = a⁴Let&#39;s compute (-a)³ first. Raising a negative to an odd power keeps the negative. So, (-a)³ = -a³. Then, multiplying by a: -a³ · a = -a^(3+1) = -a⁴. But the answer given here is a⁴, which is positive. So, unless there&#39;s a mistake in signs, this is incorrect. Therefore, C is wrong.Option D: (a + b)² = a² + b²Oh, the classic mistake. The expansion of (a + b)² is actually a² + 2ab + b². The middle term 2ab is missing here. So, D is incorrect. It&#39;s only correct if 2ab = 0, which isn&#39;t generally true. So, D is wrong.So, reviewing all options:A: Correct.B: Incorrect. Should be ab.C: Incorrect. Should be -a⁴.D: Incorrect. Missing 2ab.Therefore, the correct answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which operation is correct, we analyze each option step by step:Option A: ((a^{2}b^{3})^{2} = a^{4}b^{6})- When raising a product to a power, each factor is raised to that power: ((a^{2}b^{3})^{2} = (a^{2})^{2} cdot (b^{3})^{2}).- Applying the power of a power rule: ((a^{2})^{2} = a^{4}) and ((b^{3})^{2} = b^{6}).- Multiplying these results gives (a^{4}b^{6}). Therefore, option A is correct.Option B: (3ab - 2ab = 1)- Combining like terms: (3ab - 2ab = (3 - 2)ab = ab).- The result should be (ab), not 1. Therefore, option B is incorrect.Option C: ((-a)^{3} cdot a = a^{4})- Calculating ((-a)^{3}) gives (-a^{3}).- Multiplying by (a): (-a^{3} cdot a = -a^{4}).- The result should be (-a^{4}), not (a^{4}). Therefore, option C is incorrect.Option D: ((a + b)^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2})- Expanding ((a + b)^{2}) correctly: (a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}).- The middle term (2ab) is missing. Therefore, option D is incorrect.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{A}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>To solve this problem, we evaluate each option step by step:Option A: (a^{2}b^{3})^{2}We apply the power of a product rule (xy)^n = x^n y^n:begin{align*}(a^{2}b^{3})^{2} &amp;= (a^{2})^{2}cdot (b^{3})^{2} &amp;= a^{2cdot2} cdot b^{3cdot2} &amp;= a^{4}b^{6}end{align*}Thus, option A is correct.Option B: 3ab-2ab=1Using the distributive property:begin{align*}3ab - 2ab &amp;= (3-2)ab &amp;= 1ab &amp;= abend{align*}Since ab neq 1 in general, option B is incorrect.Option C: (-a)^{3}cdot aWe apply the power rule and multiplication of powers with the same base:begin{align*}(-a)^{3}cdot a &amp;= -a^{3}cdot a &amp;= -(a^{3}cdot a) &amp;= -a^{3+1} &amp;= -a^{4}end{align*}Since -a^{4} neq a^{4}, option C is incorrect.Option D: (a+b)^{2}We apply the binomial theorem:begin{align*}(a+b)^{2} &amp;= a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}end{align*}Since (a+b)^{2} neq a^{2} + b^{2} in general, option D is incorrect.Therefore, the correct operation among the given options is (boxed{text{A}}).</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-95d0d1ff data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review" data-v-02a0f5b3><div class="review-title" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>❓:</span>5.

The catch is that 0 cannot be immediately next to 2, either as a predecessor or a successor. Hmm, let&#39;s see. I need to figure out how many such sequences exist under these constraints. First off, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The sequence has n elements, each can be 0, 1, or 2. But 0 and 2 can&#39;t be adjacent. So if I have a 0 in the sequence, the next term can&#39;t be 2, and the previous term also can&#39;t be 2. Similarly, if I have a 2, the next term can&#39;t be 0, and the previous term can&#39;t be 0. So 0 and 2 are like forbidden neighbors. I think this is similar to some kind of restricted permutation problem where certain elements can&#39;t be next to each other. Maybe I can model this using recurrence relations. Let me try to break it down.Let&#39;s denote the number of valid sequences of length n as a_n. But maybe it&#39;s better to categorize the sequences based on their last element. Because depending on whether the last element is 0, 1, or 2, the constraints for the next element will be different. For example, if the last element is 0, the next element can&#39;t be 2. Similarly, if the last element is 2, the next element can&#39;t be 0. If the last element is 1, there are no restrictions. So perhaps I can define three separate functions:- Let a_n be the number of valid sequences of length n ending with 0.- Let b_n be the number ending with 1.- Let c_n be the number ending with 2.Then the total number of sequences would be a_n + b_n + c_n.Now, I need to find recurrence relations for a_n, b_n, and c_n. Let&#39;s think about how a sequence of length n can be built from a sequence of length n-1.If a sequence ends with 0 (a_n), then the previous element (the n-1th term) can&#39;t be 2. But also, the nth term is 0, so the (n-1)th term can&#39;t be 2. Wait, but the (n-1)th term is part of the sequence of length n-1. So maybe we need to consider how each type transitions to the next.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to think in terms of how to append a character to a sequence of length n-1 to get a sequence of length n, considering the constraints.If we have a sequence of length n-1 ending with 0 (a_{n-1}), then to append another character, since the last character is 0, we can&#39;t append 2. So we can append 0 or 1. Therefore, the number of sequences ending with 0 at length n would be the number of sequences ending with 0 or 1 or 2 at n-1, but when appending 0, we have to ensure that the previous character isn&#39;t 2. Wait, no, actually, the previous character is the one we&#39;re appending to. So if we have a sequence ending with 0, and we append 0, that&#39;s allowed. Wait, no, the problem is that 0 can&#39;t be next to 2. So if the last character of the existing sequence is 0, then the next character can&#39;t be 2. Similarly, if the existing sequence ends with 2, the next character can&#39;t be 0. If the existing sequence ends with 1, then the next character can be anything.So maybe the recurrence relations are as follows:- To append a 0 to a sequence of length n-1:  - The previous character can&#39;t be 2. So the previous sequence can end with 0 or 1. Therefore, a_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) - To append a 1 to a sequence of length n-1:  - There are no restrictions, since 1 can follow any character. So b_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})- To append a 2 to a sequence of length n-1:  - The previous character can&#39;t be 0. So the previous sequence can end with 1 or 2. Therefore, c_n = (b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})Therefore, the total number of sequences of length n is a_n + b_n + c_n, where:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}Hmm, let&#39;s check if this makes sense. For example, when n=1, the sequences are [0], [1], [2], so a_1=1, b_1=1, c_1=1, total=3.For n=2, let&#39;s compute using the recurrence relations:a_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2b_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3c_2 = b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 = 2Total = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7Let&#39;s list all possible sequences of length 2:00, 01, 02 (invalid), 10, 11, 12, 20 (invalid), 21, 22But wait, the invalid ones are 02 and 20. So total valid sequences: 9 - 2 = 7. Which matches the calculation. So that seems good.For n=3, let&#39;s compute:a_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 2 + 3 = 5b_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7c_3 = b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 = 5Total = 5 + 7 + 5 = 17Alternatively, we can try to count manually. But that might be tedious. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a pattern here. For n=1:3, n=2:7, n=3:17. The numbers seem to be 3,7,17,... Maybe the next term is 41? Let me check n=4.a_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 5 + 7 = 12b_4 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 5 +7 +5 =17c_4 = b_3 + c_3 =7 +5 =12Total=12+17+12=41. Yes, so the pattern is 3,7,17,41,...Looking at the total numbers: 3,7,17,41,... Each term is 2 times the previous term plus something? Let&#39;s see:7 = 2*3 +1? 2*3=6, 6+1=7. Then 17=2*7 +3, 2*7=14, 14+3=17. 41=2*17 +7, 34+7=41. Hmm, not sure if that&#39;s helpful. Alternatively, maybe each term is twice the previous term plus the term before that? Let&#39;s check:7 = 3*2 +1? 3*2=6, 6+1=7.17=7*2 +3? 14 +3=17.41=17*2 +7? 34 +7=41.So the pattern seems to be T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2). Let&#39;s check:For n=3: 2*7 +3=17. Correct.For n=4: 2*17 +7=41. Correct.If this is the case, then we can model the total number T(n) with the recurrence relation T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2), with T(1)=3 and T(2)=7.Wait, but where does this recurrence come from? Let me see if we can derive it from the previous a_n, b_n, c_n.We have T(n) = a_n + b_n + c_n.From the earlier equations:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}So let&#39;s express T(n) in terms of T(n-1):T(n) = a_n + b_n + c_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) + (b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}))Simplify:= a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}Combine like terms:= 2*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1} + 2*c_{n-1}Hmm, that&#39;s not immediately obvious. But maybe we can relate this to T(n-1) and T(n-2). Let&#39;s see.Wait, maybe instead of trying to find a recurrence for T(n), let&#39;s see how a_n and c_n relate. Notice that a_n and c_n seem to be symmetric. For n=1, a=1, c=1. For n=2, a=2, c=2. For n=3, a=5, c=5. For n=4, a=12, c=12. So actually, a_n = c_n for all n? That seems to be the case here. Is that always true?Yes, because the problem is symmetric with respect to 0 and 2. The constraints are that 0 can&#39;t be next to 2 and vice versa. So swapping 0 and 2 in any valid sequence will result in another valid sequence. Therefore, the number of sequences ending with 0 is equal to the number ending with 2. So a_n = c_n for all n ≥1.Therefore, we can simplify our recurrences. Let&#39;s denote a_n = c_n. Then, the total T(n) = 2*a_n + b_n.Now, let&#39;s rewrite the recurrence relations:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} (from original a_n definition)c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} (from original c_n definition)But since a_n = c_n, we can write:a_n = b_{n-1} + a_{n-1}Similarly, since T(n) = 2*a_n + b_n, and b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}Therefore, T(n) = 2*a_n + b_n = 2*(a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + (2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})Simplify:= 2*a_{n-1} + 2*b_{n-1} + 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}= (2*a_{n-1} + 2*a_{n-1}) + (2*b_{n-1} + b_{n-1})= 4*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1}But T(n-1) = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}So 4*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1} = 2*(2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + b_{n-1} = 2*T(n-1) + b_{n-1}Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let&#39;s see if we can express T(n) in terms of T(n-1) and T(n-2).From the recurrence relations:We have:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}b_n = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}Therefore, T(n) = 2*a_n + b_n = 2*(a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + (2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})= 2*a_{n-1} + 2*b_{n-1} + 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}= 4*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1}But T(n-1) = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}So let me express 4*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1} as 2*(2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + b_{n-1} = 2*T(n-1) + b_{n-1}But how to express b_{n-1} in terms of previous T terms?Looking at the expression for b_n:b_n = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}But 2*a_{n-1} = 2*a_{n-1} and b_{n-1} = b_{n-1}Wait, if we look at T(n-1) = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}, then b_{n-1} = T(n-1) - 2*a_{n-1}But that might not help directly. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider T(n) and T(n-1):We have:From above, T(n) = 4*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1}But T(n-1) = 2*a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}So let&#39;s denote x = a_{n-1}, y = b_{n-1}Then T(n-1) = 2x + yT(n) = 4x + 3yWe need to express T(n) in terms of T(n-1) and maybe other terms.If we can find a relation between x and y from previous terms.But from the recurrence relations:a_{n-1} = a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}Similarly, b_{n-1} = 2*a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}So x = a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}y = 2*a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}Therefore, substituting back into T(n) = 4x + 3y:T(n) = 4*(a_{n-2} + b_{n-2}) + 3*(2*a_{n-2} + b_{n-2})= 4a_{n-2} + 4b_{n-2} + 6a_{n-2} + 3b_{n-2}= (4a_{n-2} + 6a_{n-2}) + (4b_{n-2} + 3b_{n-2})= 10a_{n-2} + 7b_{n-2}Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s see if there&#39;s another way.Alternatively, since we noticed that the total numbers follow T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2), let&#39;s check if that holds.Given T(1)=3, T(2)=7, then T(3)=2*7 +3=17, which matches. T(4)=2*17 +7=41, which also matches. So it seems like the recurrence T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2) holds. Therefore, if we can confirm that this recurrence is valid, then we can use it to find a closed-form formula or at least state the answer in terms of this recurrence.But why does the recurrence T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2) hold? Let me try to reason.Suppose we have a valid sequence of length n-1. To form a sequence of length n, we can append a 0, 1, or 2, provided we don&#39;t violate the adjacency rules. But depending on the last character of the sequence, the available choices change. However, maybe there&#39;s a way to model this without splitting into cases.Alternatively, think of each position in the sequence. If we choose a 1, it doesn&#39;t affect the next choices. If we choose a 0 or 2, the next choice can&#39;t be 2 or 0 respectively. So this seems similar to a state machine where the states are the last character chosen. But maybe another approach: consider that the problem is similar to tiling with tiles of certain colors where adjacent tiles can&#39;t have certain colors. The recurrence for such problems often ends up being linear.But given that we already have the recurrence T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2), perhaps we can derive it as follows.Assume that the first element is 1. Then the remaining n-1 elements can be any valid sequence of length n-1, contributing T(n-1) sequences.If the first element is 0, then the next element can&#39;t be 2. So the second element must be 0 or 1. Similarly, if the first element is 2, the next element can&#39;t be 0, so it must be 1 or 2. Wait, but this approach is considering the first element rather than the last. Maybe that complicates things. Let&#39;s try the standard approach for linear recurrences.Alternatively, let&#39;s use generating functions. Let G(x) be the generating function for T(n). Then, if the recurrence is T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2), with T(0)=1 (empty sequence?), T(1)=3, T(2)=7, etc.Wait, actually, if we consider n=0, the empty sequence, which is trivially valid, so T(0)=1. Then T(1)=3, T(2)=7, T(3)=17, T(4)=41, and so on. The recurrence is T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2) for n ≥2, with T(0)=1, T(1)=3.To solve this linear recurrence, we can find the characteristic equation. Let me do that.The characteristic equation for the recurrence T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2) is r^2 - 2*r -1 =0Solving this quadratic equation: r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +4)] /2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)] /2 = [2 ± 2*sqrt(2)] /2 = 1 ± sqrt(2)Therefore, the general solution is T(n) = α*(1 + sqrt(2))^n + β*(1 - sqrt(2))^nWe can use the initial conditions to solve for α and β.Given that T(0)=1:1 = α*(1 + sqrt(2))^0 + β*(1 - sqrt(2))^0 = α + βT(1)=3:3 = α*(1 + sqrt(2)) + β*(1 - sqrt(2))Therefore, we have the system:α + β = 1α*(1 + sqrt(2)) + β*(1 - sqrt(2)) = 3Let me solve for α and β.Let’s denote equation 1: α + β =1Equation 2: α*(1 + sqrt(2)) + β*(1 - sqrt(2)) =3From equation 1: β =1 - αSubstitute into equation 2:α*(1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - α)*(1 - sqrt(2)) =3Expand:α + α*sqrt(2) + (1 - alpha) - (1 - alpha)*sqrt(2) =3Simplify:[alpha + (1 - alpha)] + [alpha*sqrt(2) - (1 - alpha)*sqrt(2)] =3Which simplifies to:1 + sqrt(2)*[alpha - (1 - alpha)] =3Compute the bracket term:alpha - (1 - alpha) = 2*alpha -1Therefore:1 + sqrt(2)*(2*alpha -1) =3Subtract 1:sqrt(2)*(2*alpha -1) =2Divide both sides by sqrt(2):2*alpha -1 = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)Therefore:2*alpha =1 + sqrt(2)=&gt; alpha = (1 + sqrt(2))/2Then beta =1 - alpha =1 - (1 + sqrt(2))/2 = (2 -1 - sqrt(2))/2 = (1 - sqrt(2))/2Therefore, the general solution is:T(n) = [(1 + sqrt(2))/2]*(1 + sqrt(2))^n + [(1 - sqrt(2))/2]*(1 - sqrt(2))^nSimplify:Note that (1 + sqrt(2))/2 multiplied by (1 + sqrt(2))^n is [(1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1}]/2Similarly, the other term is [(1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1}]/2Therefore, T(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ] / 2But let&#39;s check for n=0:T(0) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^1 + (1 - sqrt(2))^1 ] /2 = [ (1 + sqrt(2) +1 - sqrt(2)) ] /2 = 2/2 =1. Correct.For n=1:T(1) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^2 + (1 - sqrt(2))^2 ] /2Compute (1 + sqrt(2))^2 =1 + 2*sqrt(2) +2=3 +2*sqrt(2)(1 - sqrt(2))^2 =1 - 2*sqrt(2) +2=3 -2*sqrt(2)Sum: (3 +2*sqrt(2)) + (3 -2*sqrt(2))=6Divide by 2:6/2=3. Correct.For n=2:T(2)= [ (1 + sqrt(2))^3 + (1 - sqrt(2))^3 ] /2Compute (1 + sqrt(2))^3 =1 +3*sqrt(2) +3*2 +2*sqrt(2)=1 +3*sqrt(2)+6 +2*sqrt(2)=7 +5*sqrt(2)Wait, actually, better to compute step by step:(1 + sqrt(2))^3 = (1 + sqrt(2))*(1 + sqrt(2))^2 = (1 + sqrt(2))*(3 + 2*sqrt(2)) = 3*(1) + 3*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(2)*1 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 3 +3*sqrt(2) +2*sqrt(2) +4=7 +5*sqrt(2)Similarly, (1 - sqrt(2))^3 =7 -5*sqrt(2)Sum:7 +5*sqrt(2) +7 -5*sqrt(2)=14Divide by2:14/2=7. Correct.Similarly, n=3:T(3)= [ (1 + sqrt(2))^4 + (1 - sqrt(2))^4 ] /2Compute (1 + sqrt(2))^4: Let&#39;s compute (1 + sqrt(2))^2=3 +2*sqrt(2), then square that: (3 +2*sqrt(2))^2=9 +12*sqrt(2) +8=17 +12*sqrt(2)Similarly, (1 - sqrt(2))^4=17 -12*sqrt(2)Sum:17 +12*sqrt(2)+17 -12*sqrt(2)=34Divide by2:17. Correct.So the formula works. Therefore, the closed-form solution is T(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ] /2.Alternatively, we can write it as T(n) = ( (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ) / 2.But since (1 - sqrt(2)) is less than 1 in absolute value, as sqrt(2)≈1.414, so 1 - sqrt(2)≈-0.414, and its magnitude is less than 1. Therefore, as n increases, the term (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} becomes very small. So for large n, T(n) is approximately (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} / 2. But since the problem asks for the exact number, we need to keep both terms.Therefore, the number of valid sequences is T(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ] /2.Alternatively, since the problem might expect a more simplified expression or a different form, but given that the recurrence is T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2), and we derived the closed-form, this should be the answer.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a recurrence relation as the answer, but since they asked for &quot;the number of such sequences&quot;, probably the closed-form expression is desired.Alternatively, we can also write it in terms of the initial conditions. Let me check OEIS for the sequence 3,7,17,41,99,... which are the numbers here. Checking OEIS, I see that this is sequence A002605, which is described as a(n) = 2*(a(n-1) + a(n-2)), but wait, wait, no:Wait, A002605 is defined as a(n) = 2*(a(n-1) + a(n-2)), starting with a(0)=0, a(1)=1. But our sequence here starts with T(0)=1, T(1)=3, T(2)=7, T(3)=17, T(4)=41. Let&#39;s check whether 1,3,7,17,41 is a known sequence.Looking up OEIS for 1,3,7,17,41: Yes, it&#39;s A001333, numerators of continued fraction convergents to sqrt(2). The sequence starts 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, ..., but our sequence starts with 1,3,7,17,41,... which matches from the third term. Wait, perhaps shifted.Alternatively, considering that T(n) here is equal to ( (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ) /2, which is similar to the formula for Pell numbers or related sequences.The Pell numbers are defined by P(n) = 2*P(n-1) + P(n-2), with P(0)=0, P(1)=1. The Pell-Lucas numbers or the companion Pell numbers are defined by Q(n) = 2*Q(n-1) + Q(n-2), with Q(0)=Q(1)=2. But our sequence here is T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + T(n-2) with T(0)=1, T(1)=3. So it&#39;s similar to the Pell-Lucas numbers but starting with different initial conditions.Alternatively, perhaps T(n) is related to the Pell numbers. Let&#39;s see, Pell numbers start 0,1,2,5,12,29,70,... Our sequence is 1,3,7,17,41,99,... which is double the Pell numbers shifted by one. For example, Pell(2)=2, T(1)=3=2+1. Pell(3)=5, T(2)=7=5+2. Pell(4)=12, T(3)=17=12+5. Wait, not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps T(n) = Pell(n+1) + Pell(n). Let&#39;s check:Pell(1)=1, Pell(2)=2. 1+2=3=T(1). Pell(2)=2, Pell(3)=5. 2+5=7=T(2). Pell(3)=5, Pell(4)=12. 5+12=17=T(3). Pell(4)=12, Pell(5)=29. 12+29=41=T(4). Yes! So T(n) = Pell(n+1) + Pell(n). Therefore, the closed-form can also be expressed in terms of Pell numbers, but maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of the recurrence or the closed-form we found.Given that the problem is asking for the number of sequences, and the answer can be expressed in terms of a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula. The closed-form formula is:T(n) = frac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}Alternatively, since (1 - sqrt(2)) is negative and its magnitude is less than 1, the term (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} becomes negligible for large n, but for exact counts, both terms are needed.Therefore, the answer is this expression. Alternatively, we can write it using the Pell numbers, but since the problem might prefer the expression in terms of radicals, or perhaps recognize it as a known sequence. However, given the initial terms and the recurrence, this closed-form is acceptable.Alternatively, if the problem expects a matrix exponentiation approach or generating functions, but since we already have the closed-form, that&#39;s probably the most concise answer.So, to recap, the number of valid sequences is given by T(n) = [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ] /2. This is derived from setting up the recurrence relations based on the last character of the sequence, recognizing the symmetry between 0 and 2, reducing the problem to a linear recurrence, solving its characteristic equation, and confirming with initial terms.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{frac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}.Final AnswerThe number of such sequences is boxed{dfrac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of sequences of length ( n ) where each term is 0, 1, or 2, and 0 is neither the predecessor nor the successor of 2, we define three separate functions based on the last element of the sequence:- ( a_n ): number of valid sequences ending with 0- ( b_n ): number of valid sequences ending with 1- ( c_n ): number of valid sequences ending with 2The recurrence relations for these functions are:- ( a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} )- ( b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} )- ( c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} )Due to symmetry, ( a_n = c_n ). The total number of sequences ( T(n) ) is given by ( T(n) = a_n + b_n + c_n ). Using the symmetry, we simplify to ( T(n) = 2a_n + b_n ).We derive the recurrence relation for ( T(n) ):- ( T(n) = 2T(n-1) + T(n-2) )The characteristic equation for this recurrence is ( r^2 - 2r - 1 = 0 ), with roots ( 1 + sqrt{2} ) and ( 1 - sqrt{2} ). The general solution is:[ T(n) = alpha (1 + sqrt{2})^n + beta (1 - sqrt{2})^n ]Using initial conditions ( T(0) = 1 ) and ( T(1) = 3 ), we solve for ( alpha ) and ( beta ):- ( alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{2}}{2} )- ( beta = frac{1 - sqrt{2}}{2} )Thus, the closed-form solution is:[ T(n) = frac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2} ]The number of such sequences is:[boxed{dfrac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the number of sequences of length n where each term is 0, 1, or 2. The catch is that 0 can&#39;t be next to 2, either before or after. Hmm, let me think. So, 0 can&#39;t be adjacent to 2. That means if there&#39;s a 0 in the sequence, the numbers next to it can&#39;t be 2, and similarly, if there&#39;s a 2, the numbers next to it can&#39;t be 0. So, 0 and 2 have to be separated by at least a 1. Got it.Let me start with small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.For n=1: The sequence can be either [0], [1], or [2]. So that&#39;s 3 sequences. Since there&#39;s only one element, there&#39;s no adjacency issue. So, answer is 3.For n=2: Now we need to make sure that 0 and 2 aren&#39;t adjacent. Let&#39;s list all possible sequences. Each position can be 0,1,2, so normally 3^2=9 sequences. But we need to exclude the ones where 0 and 2 are adjacent.Which sequences are invalid? The ones where the first is 0 and the second is 2, or the first is 2 and the second is 0. So, two invalid sequences: [0,2] and [2,0]. So total valid sequences are 9 - 2 = 7.Wait, let&#39;s verify by listing:Valid sequences:[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]. Yes, that&#39;s 7. So, correct.For n=3: Let&#39;s try to find a pattern or recurrence relation here. Let me think. Maybe the number of valid sequences of length n can be built up from sequences of length n-1 by adding a valid term at the end. But the problem is that the last term affects what can be added next.So, maybe we can model this with states. Let&#39;s consider the possible endings of the sequence. Since the only restriction is that 0 and 2 can&#39;t be adjacent, if the last term is 0, then the previous term can&#39;t be 2; if the last term is 2, the previous term can&#39;t be 0; and if the last term is 1, there are no restrictions.Wait, but maybe instead of tracking just the last term, we need to track the last term and whether it&#39;s 0, 1, or 2. Let&#39;s try to define a recurrence relation where we have three states:- Let a_n be the number of valid sequences of length n ending with 0.- Let b_n be the number of valid sequences of length n ending with 1.- Let c_n be the number of valid sequences of length n ending with 2.Then, the total number of sequences would be a_n + b_n + c_n.Now, let&#39;s figure out the recurrence relations for a_n, b_n, and c_n.Starting with a_n: To end with 0, the previous term cannot be 2. So the previous term can be 0 or 1. Therefore, the number of sequences ending with 0 is equal to the number of sequences of length n-1 ending with 0 or 1, multiplied by 0 being added at the end. So, a_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}).Similarly, for c_n: To end with 2, the previous term cannot be 0. So the previous term can be 1 or 2. Therefore, c_n = (b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}).For b_n: Ending with 1, there are no restrictions. So the previous term can be 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, b_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}).Hmm, let&#39;s verify this with n=1 and n=2.For n=1:a_1 = 1 (sequence [0])b_1 = 1 (sequence [1])c_1 = 1 (sequence [2])Total: 3, which matches.For n=2:a_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2c_2 = b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 = 2b_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3Total: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which matches.Good. Let&#39;s check n=3:a_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 2 + 3 = 5c_3 = b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 = 5b_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7Total: 5 + 5 + 7 = 17Wait, let me verify by counting. For n=3, total sequences would be 3^3=27. Subtract the invalid ones. How many invalid sequences are there?Invalid sequences are those where 0 is adjacent to 2. So, we can have:- [0,2,x], [x,0,2], [2,0,x], [x,2,0]. But need to make sure they are counted correctly.Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion. Let&#39;s think.Number of sequences with at least one occurrence of 0 adjacent to 2.First, count all sequences where 0 is next to 2 at least once. For sequences of length 3, the possible positions where 0 and 2 can be adjacent are positions 1-2 and 2-3.For each adjacent pair, count the number of sequences where that pair is 0-2 or 2-0.For the first pair (positions 1-2): there are 2 possibilities (0-2 or 2-0), and the third position can be anything (3 choices). So 2*3=6.Similarly, for the second pair (positions 2-3): 2*3=6.But wait, sequences where both pairs are invalid (i.e., 0-2-0 or 2-0-2) are counted twice. So we need to subtract those.How many sequences have both adjacent pairs as 0-2 or 2-0? For length 3, sequences like [0,2,0] or [2,0,2]. There are 2 such sequences.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion, the total number of invalid sequences is 6 + 6 - 2 = 10.Thus, the number of valid sequences is 27 - 10 = 17. Which matches the recurrence result. Great.So, the recurrence seems to work. Therefore, the total number of sequences is a_n + b_n + c_n, with the relations:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}Now, let&#39;s try to find a closed-form formula or a simpler recurrence.Looking at the total number, let&#39;s denote T_n = a_n + b_n + c_n.Then, T_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) + (b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) )Wait, that might not be the right way. Let me substitute the recurrence relations into T_n:T_n = a_n + b_n + c_nFrom the recurrence:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}c_n = c_{n-1} + b_{n-1}b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}Therefore, T_n = (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) + (c_{n-1} + b_{n-1})Combine the terms:= a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} + c_{n-1} + b_{n-1}= 2a_{n-1} + 3b_{n-1} + 2c_{n-1}But T_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}So, T_n = 2a_{n-1} + 2c_{n-1} + 3b_{n-1}= 2(a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) + 3b_{n-1}Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express T_n in terms of T_{n-1} and T_{n-2}.Wait, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s look at how a_n and c_n relate.From a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}Similarly, c_n = c_{n-1} + b_{n-1}So, a_n and c_n have symmetric recurrence relations. That suggests that a_n = c_n for all n &gt;=1, provided that the initial conditions are symmetric.Looking at n=1: a_1 = c_1 = 1. Yes, symmetric. For n=2: a_2 = 2, c_2 = 2. n=3: a_3 =5, c_3=5. So yes, a_n = c_n for all n. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by noting that a_n = c_n.Therefore, let&#39;s set a_n = c_n. Then, the total T_n = 2a_n + b_n.Also, from the recurrence for a_n: a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}Similarly, c_n = a_n, so that&#39;s covered.For b_n: b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}Therefore, we can model this with two variables: a_n and b_n.So, the equations are:a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}b_n = 2a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}And T_n = 2a_n + b_nLet me check for n=1:a_1 =1, b_1=1. T_1=2*1 +1=3. Correct.n=2:a_2 = a_1 + b_1 =1 +1=2b_2 =2a_1 +b_1=2*1 +1=3T_2=2*2 +3=7. Correct.n=3:a_3 =a_2 +b_2=2 +3=5b_3=2a_2 +b_2=4 +3=7T_3=2*5 +7=17. Correct.n=4:a_4 =a_3 +b_3=5 +7=12b_4=2a_3 +b_3=10 +7=17T_4=2*12 +17=24 +17=41Let me verify T_4. n=4, total sequences 3^4=81. Invalid sequences: How many?Number of invalid sequences for n=4. This might take time, but let&#39;s try.Invalid sequences have at least one occurrence of 0 adjacent to 2. Let&#39;s use inclusion-exclusion again.Number of adjacent pairs in a sequence of length 4: 3 pairs (1-2, 2-3, 3-4). Each pair can be 0-2 or 2-0, which are forbidden.First, count the number of sequences where at least one forbidden pair occurs.For each forbidden pair (positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4):Each forbidden pair has 2 possibilities (0-2 or 2-0). The other positions can be anything.For a single forbidden pair:For example, if the forbidden pair is at positions 1-2: 2 choices for the pair, and 3^2=9 choices for the remaining two positions. So 2*9=18.Similarly for forbidden pair at 2-3: 2*3*3=18.For forbidden pair at 3-4: same, 18.Total for single forbidden pairs: 3*18=54.But now we have overcounted sequences where two forbidden pairs overlap.How many sequences have two forbidden pairs?There are two cases: overlapping pairs (like positions 1-2 and 2-3) or non-overlapping pairs (positions 1-2 and 3-4). Wait, but in n=4, overlapping pairs would be consecutive, and non-overlapping would be separated.Wait, pairs 1-2 and 2-3 are overlapping; pairs 1-2 and 3-4 are non-overlapping.For overlapping pairs (positions 1-2 and 2-3):The sequence would have two forbidden pairs. For example, positions 1-2-3 must be 0-2-0 or 2-0-2. So there are 2 possibilities for the triplet. Then, the remaining position (4th) can be anything: 3 choices. So 2*3=6 sequences.Similarly, overlapping pairs at 2-3 and 3-4: same, 6 sequences.For non-overlapping pairs (positions 1-2 and 3-4):Each forbidden pair is separate. Each forbidden pair has 2 possibilities, and the middle position (position 3) can be anything? Wait, no. If positions 1-2 are forbidden and positions 3-4 are forbidden, then positions 1-2 can be 0-2 or 2-0 (2 choices), positions 3-4 can be 0-2 or 2-0 (2 choices), and position 3 is part of both pairs. Wait, no, positions 3-4 are separate from 1-2, so position 3 is in the second forbidden pair. Wait, no, in positions 1-2 and 3-4, they are separate. So, the middle position (position 2 and 3) are not overlapping. Wait, positions 1-2 and 3-4: positions 1,2 and 3,4. So they are separated by position 3. Wait, no, position 3 is part of the second pair.Wait, in n=4, pairs 1-2 and 3-4 are non-overlapping. Each of these pairs can be forbidden. For each pair, 2 choices. The remaining positions (position 3 if we fix 1-2, but wait, if we fix 1-2 and 3-4, then positions 1-2 and 3-4 are fixed with forbidden pairs, and the remaining position is position 3 (wait, no, positions 1-2, 3-4. So in total, positions 1,2,3,4. If 1-2 is forbidden and 3-4 is forbidden, then positions 1,2 and 3,4 are fixed. The remaining position is position 3 (but position 3 is part of the second forbidden pair). Wait, no. Let&#39;s clarify:If we have forbidden pairs at 1-2 and 3-4, then:- Positions 1-2: 0-2 or 2-0 (2 choices)- Positions 3-4: 0-2 or 2-0 (2 choices)- The middle position (position 3) is the start of the second forbidden pair. Wait, no, position 3 is part of the second forbidden pair (positions 3-4). So positions 1-2 and 3-4: each pair is fixed independently, except for position 3. Wait, no, position 3 is only in the second pair. So actually, these are independent. So the total number is 2 (for 1-2) * 2 (for 3-4) * 3^0 (no other positions to choose) = 4. Wait, but that can&#39;t be. Wait, if positions 1-2 and 3-4 are fixed, then the entire sequence is fixed except for... Wait, positions 1,2 are fixed, positions 3,4 are fixed. So the entire sequence is determined. Each forbidden pair has 2 possibilities, so total sequences with forbidden pairs at 1-2 and 3-4 are 2*2=4.Wait, but in reality, sequences like [0,2,0,2], [0,2,2,0], [2,0,0,2], [2,0,2,0]. Yes, four sequences. So, 4.Therefore, the number of sequences with two forbidden pairs: overlapping pairs (two cases: 1-2-3 and 2-3-4) each contribute 6 sequences (as calculated before), and non-overlapping pairs (1-2 and 3-4) contribute 4 sequences. Wait, but overlapping pairs (1-2 and 2-3) would be sequences where the triplet 1-2-3 is forbidden. So, as we calculated earlier, triplet like 0-2-0 or 2-0-2, with the fourth position arbitrary.Wait, but in the overlapping case, we have two forbidden pairs: 1-2 and 2-3. So sequences where both 1-2 and 2-3 are forbidden. So, triplet 1-2-3 must be 0-2-0 or 2-0-2. Then, the fourth position can be anything. So, 2*3=6 for each overlapping case. There are two overlapping cases: positions 1-2-3 and 2-3-4. Each gives 6 sequences. So total overlapping two-pair forbidden sequences: 12.Non-overlapping two-pair forbidden sequences: 1-2 and 3-4: 4 sequences.So total two-pair forbidden sequences: 12 + 4 = 16.But wait, when we subtract the overcounts, we need to consider sequences with three forbidden pairs? In n=4, can we have three forbidden pairs?For three forbidden pairs, we need the sequence to have forbidden pairs at 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4. That would require the sequence to be 0-2-0-2 or 2-0-2-0. So two sequences.So, applying inclusion-exclusion:Total invalid sequences = (number with at least one forbidden pair) - (number with at least two forbidden pairs) + (number with at least three forbidden pairs)Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula is:|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|Where A, B, C are the sets of sequences with forbidden pairs at 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 respectively.So:|A| = |B| = |C| = 18 each (as calculated before)|A ∩ B|: sequences with forbidden pairs at 1-2 and 2-3: 6 (as calculated)|A ∩ C|: sequences with forbidden pairs at 1-2 and 3-4: 4 (as calculated)|B ∩ C|: sequences with forbidden pairs at 2-3 and 3-4: 6 (similar to |A ∩ B|)|A ∩ B ∩ C|: sequences with forbidden pairs at 1-2, 2-3, 3-4: 2 (as calculated)Therefore:Total invalid sequences = 18 + 18 + 18 - 6 - 4 - 6 + 2= 54 - 16 + 2= 54 - 14 = 40Therefore, valid sequences = 81 - 40 = 41. Which matches T_4=41. Great.So, the recurrence works. Therefore, for n=4, it&#39;s 41. So, the sequence of total numbers is 3,7,17,41,...Looking at this sequence: 3,7,17,41,... It seems like each term is roughly doubling and adding something. Let&#39;s see:7 = 2*3 +117=2*7 +341=2*17 +7Hmm, not exactly a linear recurrence. Wait, let&#39;s check the ratios:7/3 ≈2.333, 17/7≈2.428, 41/17≈2.411. Not a constant ratio.Wait, maybe the recurrence for T_n is T_n = 2*T_{n-1} + something.Looking at the values:From n=1 to n=2: 3 to7: 3*2 +1=7n=2 to n=3:7*2 +3=17n=3 to n=4:17*2 +7=41So, it seems like T_n = 2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} ?Wait, 2*7 +3=17, which is 2*T_2 + T_1=14 +3=17.Similarly, 2*17 +7=41, which is 2*T_3 + T_2=34 +7=41.Then, if this pattern holds, the recurrence is T_n = 2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2}Check for n=4: 2*T_3 + T_2=2*17 +7=41. Correct.So, seems that the total T_n satisfies T_n = 2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2}If that&#39;s the case, this is a linear recurrence relation with characteristic equation r^2 - 2r -1=0.Solving this, the roots are r = [2 ± sqrt(4 +4)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [2 ± 2*sqrt(2)]/2 = 1 ± sqrt(2).Therefore, the general solution would be T_n = α(1 + sqrt(2))^n + β(1 - sqrt(2))^nUsing the initial conditions to solve for α and β.Given:For n=1: T_1=3= α(1 + sqrt(2)) + β(1 - sqrt(2))For n=0: Wait, the recurrence starts at n=1 and n=2? Wait, to use n=1 and n=2 as initial conditions.Wait, the recurrence T_n = 2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} is valid for n &gt;=3, with T_1=3, T_2=7, T_3=17, T_4=41, etc.But to solve the recurrence, we need two initial terms. Let&#39;s take n=0. If we consider n=0, which would be the empty sequence. How many sequences of length 0? Just 1. But does T_0=1 fit into the recurrence?Check for n=2: T_2 =2*T_1 + T_0 =&gt;7=2*3 + T_0 =&gt;T_0=1. Yes. So, T_0=1.Therefore, the initial conditions are T_0=1, T_1=3.Therefore, the general solution is T_n = α(1 + sqrt(2))^n + β(1 - sqrt(2))^nUsing T_0=1:1 = α + βUsing T_1=3:3 = α(1 + sqrt(2)) + β(1 - sqrt(2))We have the system:α + β =1α(1 + sqrt(2)) + β(1 - sqrt(2))=3Let me solve for α and β.From the first equation, β =1 - αSubstitute into the second equation:α(1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - α)(1 - sqrt(2)) =3Expand:α(1 + sqrt(2)) + (1)(1 - sqrt(2)) - α(1 - sqrt(2)) =3Factor α:α[(1 + sqrt(2)) - (1 - sqrt(2))] + (1 - sqrt(2)) =3Compute the coefficient of α:(1 + sqrt(2) -1 + sqrt(2)) = 2 sqrt(2)So:α*2 sqrt(2) + (1 - sqrt(2)) =3Therefore:α*2 sqrt(2) =3 - (1 - sqrt(2))=2 + sqrt(2)Thus:α=(2 + sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(2))= Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):=(2 + sqrt(2))sqrt(2)/(2*2)= (2 sqrt(2) +2)/4= (sqrt(2)+1)/2Similarly, β=1 - α=1 - (sqrt(2)+1)/2=(2 - sqrt(2)-1)/2=(1 - sqrt(2))/2Therefore, the general solution is:T_n= [(sqrt(2)+1)/2](1 + sqrt(2))^n + [(1 - sqrt(2))/2](1 - sqrt(2))^nSimplify terms:Note that (1 + sqrt(2)) and (1 - sqrt(2)) are conjugates.Let me write this as:T_n= A(1 + sqrt(2))^n + B(1 - sqrt(2))^nWhere A=(sqrt(2)+1)/2 and B=(1 - sqrt(2))/2Alternatively, we can express this using the initial terms. But maybe there&#39;s a simpler closed-form expression.Alternatively, notice that this sequence is related to Pell numbers. Pell numbers have the recurrence P_n=2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}, which is the same as our recurrence here. The Pell numbers start with P0=0, P1=1, P2=2, P3=5, P4=12, etc. But our T_n sequence is 1,3,7,17,41,... which seems to be the Pell numbers scaled or shifted.Wait, checking Pell numbers: The Pell numbers are defined by Pn = 2 Pn-1 + Pn-2, with P0=0, P1=1. So, the sequence is 0,1,2,5,12,29,70,...But our T_n is 1,3,7,17,41,... which is similar but starts at n=0: T0=1, T1=3, T2=7, etc.Comparing T_n with Pell numbers:T_n = P_{n+1} + P_n ?Check:For n=0: T0=1; P1 + P0=1 +0=1. Correct.n=1: T1=3; P2 + P1=2 +1=3. Correct.n=2: T2=7; P3 + P2=5 +2=7. Correct.n=3: T3=17; P4 + P3=12 +5=17. Correct.n=4: T4=41; P5 + P4=29 +12=41. Correct.Yes! Therefore, T_n = P_{n+1} + P_n, where P_n is the nth Pell number.Given that Pell numbers satisfy P_n=2 P_{n-1} + P_{n-2}, and our T_n satisfies the same recurrence. Therefore, T_n is the sum of consecutive Pell numbers.Alternatively, since T_n=2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2}, which is the same recurrence as Pell numbers but with different initial conditions.But since we already have the closed-form expression in terms of (1 + sqrt(2))^n and (1 - sqrt(2))^n, we can use that.So, T_n= [(sqrt(2)+1)/2](1 + sqrt(2))^n + [(1 - sqrt(2))/2](1 - sqrt(2))^nAlternatively, we can write this as:T_n= frac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}Wait, let&#39;s verify this:For n=0:frac{(1+sqrt{2})^{1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{1}}{2}= [ (1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - sqrt(2)) ] /2= 2/2=1. Correct.For n=1:frac{(1+sqrt{2})^2 + (1-sqrt{2})^2}{2}= [ (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) + (3 - 2 sqrt(2)) ] /2= 6/2=3. Correct.For n=2:frac{(1+sqrt{2})^3 + (1-sqrt{2})^3}{2}= [ (1 + 3 sqrt(2) + 3*2 + 2 sqrt(2)*2) + (1 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3*2 - 2 sqrt(2)*2) ] Wait, actually compute (1 + sqrt(2))^3:(1 + sqrt(2))^3=1 + 3 sqrt(2) + 3*(sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(2))^3=1 + 3 sqrt(2) + 3*2 + 2 sqrt(2)=1 +3 sqrt(2) +6 +2 sqrt(2)=7 +5 sqrt(2)Similarly, (1 - sqrt(2))^3=7 -5 sqrt(2)Therefore, average is (7 +5 sqrt(2) +7 -5 sqrt(2))/2=14/2=7. Correct.Similarly, for n=3:frac{(1+sqrt{2})^4 + (1-sqrt{2})^4}{2}Compute (1 + sqrt(2))^4:(1 + sqrt(2))^4= (7 +5 sqrt(2))*(1 + sqrt(2))=7*1 +7 sqrt(2) +5 sqrt(2) +5*2=7 +12 sqrt(2) +10=17 +12 sqrt(2)Similarly, (1 - sqrt(2))^4=17 -12 sqrt(2)Average: (17 +12 sqrt(2) +17 -12 sqrt(2))/2=34/2=17. Correct.So, indeed, T_n= [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} ] / 2Therefore, the closed-form formula is T_n= frac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}Alternatively, since (1 + sqrt(2)) and (1 - sqrt(2)) are conjugates, this expression is always an integer, as we saw in the examples.Therefore, the number of valid sequences is T_n= frac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}Alternatively, using the Pell number relation, T_n= P_{n+1} + P_n, but if the problem expects an expression in terms of powers or something else, maybe writing it in terms of the closed-form expression.Alternatively, since the problem says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;, likely either the recurrence T_n=2*T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} with T_0=1, T_1=3, or the closed-form formula.But perhaps the answer is expected to be expressed as a formula in terms of n, which would be the closed-form.So, boxed answer: boxed{dfrac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}Alternatively, since (1 - sqrt(2))^{n+1} tends to zero as n increases, for large n, T_n approximates dfrac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}But the exact answer is the one with both terms.Therefore, the boxed answer is boxed{dfrac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}.Final AnswerThe number of such sequences is boxed{dfrac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the number of sequences of length ( n ) where each term is 0, 1, or 2, and 0 is neither the predecessor nor the successor of 2, we can use a recurrence relation approach. We define three states:- ( a_n ): the number of valid sequences of length ( n ) ending with 0.- ( b_n ): the number of valid sequences of length ( n ) ending with 1.- ( c_n ): the number of valid sequences of length ( n ) ending with 2.The recurrence relations are:- ( a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} )- ( c_n = b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} )- ( b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} )The total number of sequences ( T_n ) is given by ( T_n = a_n + b_n + c_n ).By analyzing the recurrence relations and verifying with initial conditions, we find that the total number of sequences ( T_n ) satisfies the recurrence relation:[ T_n = 2T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} ]with initial conditions ( T_0 = 1 ) and ( T_1 = 3 ).The closed-form solution for this recurrence relation is:[ T_n = frac{(1 + sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1 - sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2} ]Thus, the number of such sequences is:[boxed{dfrac{(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1} + (1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}}{2}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-02a0f5b3></div><p class="review-content" data-v-02a0f5b3><span class="icon" data-v-02a0f5b3>🔑:</span>5. Let in the said sequence, there are a_{n} ending with 0, b_{n} ending with 1, and c_{n} ending with 2, then a_{1}=b_{1}= c_{1}=1. And there are the recurrence relations a_{n+1}=a_{n}+b_{n}, b_{n+1}=a_{n}+b_{n}+c_{n}, c_{n+1}=b_{n}+c_{n}. Thus, a_{n+1}+c_{n+1}+sqrt{2} b_{n+1}=1+ sqrt{2}left(a_{n}+c_{n}+sqrt{2} b_{n}right), hence a_{n}+c_{n}+sqrt{2} b_{n}=(1+sqrt{2})^{n-1}left(a_{1}+c_{1}+sqrt{2} b_{1}right)=(1+sqrt{2})^{n-1}(2+sqrt{2})=sqrt{2}(1+sqrt{2})^{n}, taking the conjugate gives a_{n}+c_{n}-sqrt{2} b_{n}=-sqrt{2}(1-sqrt{2})^{n}. Therefore, a_{n}+c_{n}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left[(1+sqrt{2})^{n}-(1-sqrt{2})^{n}right], b_{n}=frac{1}{2}left[(1+sqrt{2})^{n}right. left.+(1-sqrt{2})^{n}right]. Hence, a_{n}+b_{n}+c_{n}=frac{1}{2}left[(1+sqrt{2})^{n+1}+(1-sqrt{2})^{n+1}right].
