I have this problem here: Given that the real number x satisfies 20 sin x = 22 cos x, then I need to find the greatest integer not exceeding the real number (1/(sin x cos x) - 1)^7. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to solve for x or find sin x and cos x such that 20 sin x = 22 cos x. Then, once I have those, compute 1/(sin x cos x) - 1, raise it to the 7th power, and find the greatest integer less than or equal to that value. Alright, step by step.First, let&#39;s tackle the equation 20 sin x = 22 cos x. Maybe I can divide both sides by cos x to get tan x? Let&#39;s try. If I divide both sides by cos x, assuming cos x ≠ 0, then I get 20 tan x = 22. So tan x = 22/20. Simplify that: 22 divided by 20 is 11/10. So tan x = 1.1. Therefore, x is arctangent of 1.1. But maybe I don&#39;t need to find x itself. Instead, since I need sin x and cos x, maybe I can use the identity that if tan x = 11/10, then sin x and cos x can be expressed in terms of a right triangle with opposite side 11, adjacent side 10, hypotenuse sqrt(10^2 + 11^2). Let&#39;s compute that hypotenuse. 10 squared is 100, 11 squared is 121, so hypotenuse is sqrt(221). Therefore, sin x = 11/sqrt(221) and cos x = 10/sqrt(221). Let me check that: tan x = (11/sqrt(221))/(10/sqrt(221)) = 11/10, which matches. Good.So, sin x = 11/sqrt(221), cos x = 10/sqrt(221). Therefore, sin x cos x is (11/sqrt(221))(10/sqrt(221)) = 110 / 221. Because sqrt(221) times sqrt(221) is 221. So sin x cos x = 110/221. Let me check that: 11 times 10 is 110, and sqrt(221) squared is 221. Yep, so that&#39;s correct.Therefore, 1/(sin x cos x) is 221/110. So 1/(sin x cos x) - 1 is 221/110 - 1. Let&#39;s compute that. 221 divided by 110 is 2.0090909..., because 110*2 = 220, so 221/110 = 2 + 1/110 ≈ 2.0090909... So subtracting 1 gives us 1.0090909... So approximately 1.0090909. Therefore, (1.0090909...)^7. Hmm, need to compute that. The problem asks for the greatest integer not exceeding this value, so essentially the floor of (1.0090909...)^7.So first, let&#39;s note that 1.0090909... is equal to 1 + 1/110. Because 221/110 - 1 = (221 - 110)/110 = 111/110 = 1 + 1/110. Wait, wait a second. Wait, 221/110 - 1 = (221 - 110)/110 = 111/110, which simplifies to 1.0090909... Yes. So 111/110. So the expression is (111/110)^7. So I need to compute (111/110)^7 and find the greatest integer less than or equal to that.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (1 + 1/110)^7 and use the binomial theorem to approximate it. Let&#39;s consider that. Let me recall that (1 + r)^n ≈ 1 + nr + n(n-1)r^2/2 + ... for small r. Here, r = 1/110 ≈ 0.00909, which is relatively small, so maybe a few terms of the binomial expansion would approximate it well enough to find the integer part.Let&#39;s try that. So let&#39;s compute up to a few terms:First term: 1.Second term: 7*(1/110) ≈ 7/110 ≈ 0.0636.Third term: 7*6/2*(1/110)^2 ≈ 21*(1/12100) ≈ 21/12100 ≈ 0.0017355.Fourth term: 7*6*5/6*(1/110)^3 ≈ 35*(1/1331000) ≈ 35/1331000 ≈ 0.0000263.Fifth term: 7*6*5*4/24*(1/110)^4 ≈ 35*(1/146410000) ≈ 35/146410000 ≈ 0.000000239.So the terms are decreasing rapidly. So adding up these terms:1 + 0.0636 + 0.0017355 + 0.0000263 + 0.000000239 ≈ 1.06536 approximately. The remaining terms are negligible, so the total is approximately 1.06536. Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ 1.06536. But wait, that seems low. Let me check my calculations again, because maybe my approximations are off.Wait, perhaps the third term was miscalculated. Let&#39;s recast:Third term is C(7,2)*(1/110)^2. C(7,2) is 21, so 21*(1/110)^2. 21*(1/12100) is 21/12100. Let&#39;s compute 21 divided by 12100. 12100 is 12.1 thousand, so 21/12.1 thousand. 21 divided by 12.1 is approximately 1.7355, so 1.7355 thousandths, which is 0.0017355. That&#39;s correct.Fourth term: C(7,3)*(1/110)^3. C(7,3)=35. 35*(1/110)^3. (1/110)^3 is 1/1331000. So 35/1331000. 35 divided by 1.331 million. 35/1.331 ≈ 26.3, so 26.3 millionths, which is 0.0000263. Correct.Fifth term: C(7,4)*(1/110)^4. C(7,4)=35. 35*(1/110)^4. (1/110)^4 = 1/146410000. So 35/146410000 ≈ 0.000000239. Correct.So total after five terms: 1 + 0.0636 + 0.0017355 + 0.0000263 + 0.000000239 ≈ 1.06536.But let&#39;s check with a calculator to see if (111/110)^7 is approximately 1.06536. Wait, 111/110 is 1.0090909..., so 1.0090909^7. Let me compute it step by step.First, compute 1.0090909 squared. 1.0090909 * 1.0090909. Let&#39;s compute:1.0090909 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0182648. (Because (1 + 0.0090909)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0090909 + 0.0090909^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0181818 + 0.0000826 ≈ 1.0182644)Then, 1.0182644 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0182644 + 1.0182644*0.0090909 ≈ 1.0182644 + 0.009258 ≈ 1.0275224. (Third power)Fourth power: 1.0275224 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0275224 + 1.0275224*0.0090909 ≈ 1.0275224 + 0.009341 ≈ 1.0368634.Fifth power: 1.0368634 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0368634 + 1.0368634*0.0090909 ≈ 1.0368634 + 0.009426 ≈ 1.0462894.Sixth power: 1.0462894 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0462894 + 1.0462894*0.0090909 ≈ 1.0462894 + 0.009512 ≈ 1.0558014.Seventh power: 1.0558014 * 1.0090909 ≈ 1.0558014 + 1.0558014*0.0090909 ≈ 1.0558014 + 0.009599 ≈ 1.0654004.So according to this step-by-step multiplication, (1.0090909)^7 ≈ 1.0654. Which is about 1.0654. The binomial approximation gave us 1.06536, which is very close. So that&#39;s correct.So (111/110)^7 ≈ 1.0654. Therefore, the greatest integer not exceeding this value is 1. So the answer is 1. Wait, but let&#39;s make sure. Because 1.0654 is approximately 1.0654, which is less than 2, so the floor is 1. But let me double-check if this approximation is accurate.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a better way to compute (1 + 1/110)^7. Let&#39;s compute (111/110)^7 exactly as a fraction and then convert it to a decimal. Let&#39;s see. 111/110 is 111 over 110. So (111)^7 divided by (110)^7. That seems tedious, but maybe we can compute it step by step.First, compute (111/110)^2: 111^2 = 12321, 110^2 = 12100. So 12321/12100 ≈ 1.0182644.(111/110)^3 = (12321 * 111)/(12100 * 110) = (12321*111)/(1331000). Let&#39;s compute 12321*111. 12321*100 = 1,232,100; 12321*10 = 123,210; 12321*1 = 12,321. Total: 1,232,100 + 123,210 = 1,355,310 + 12,321 = 1,367,631. So 1,367,631 / 1,331,000 ≈ 1.027522.(111/110)^4: Multiply previous result by 111/110. So 1,367,631 * 111 = ?Let me compute 1,367,631 * 100 = 136,763,1001,367,631 * 10 = 13,676,3101,367,631 * 1 = 1,367,631Total: 136,763,100 + 13,676,310 = 150,439,410 + 1,367,631 = 151,807,041Divide by denominator 1,331,000 * 110 = 146,410,000. So 151,807,041 / 146,410,000 ≈ 1.03686.(111/110)^4 ≈ 1.03686.(111/110)^5: Multiply previous fraction 151,807,041/146,410,000 by 111/110.Numerator: 151,807,041 * 111 = ?151,807,041 * 100 = 15,180,704,100151,807,041 * 10 = 1,518,070,410151,807,041 * 1 = 151,807,041Total: 15,180,704,100 + 1,518,070,410 = 16,698,774,510 + 151,807,041 = 16,850,581,551Denominator: 146,410,000 * 110 = 16,105,100,000So (111/110)^5 ≈ 16,850,581,551 / 16,105,100,000 ≈ 1.046289.(111/110)^6: Multiply numerator by 111 and denominator by 110:Numerator: 16,850,581,551 * 111Let&#39;s compute 16,850,581,551 * 100 = 1,685,058,155,10016,850,581,551 * 10 = 168,505,815,51016,850,581,551 * 1 = 16,850,581,551Total: 1,685,058,155,100 + 168,505,815,510 = 1,853,563,970,610 + 16,850,581,551 = 1,870,414,552,161Denominator: 16,105,100,000 * 110 = 1,771,561,000,000Thus, (111/110)^6 ≈ 1,870,414,552,161 / 1,771,561,000,000 ≈ 1.055801.(111/110)^7: Multiply numerator by 111, denominator by 110:Numerator: 1,870,414,552,161 * 1111,870,414,552,161 * 100 = 187,041,455,216,1001,870,414,552,161 * 10 = 18,704,145,521,6101,870,414,552,161 * 1 = 1,870,414,552,161Total: 187,041,455,216,100 + 18,704,145,521,610 = 205,745,600,737,710 + 1,870,414,552,161 = 207,616,015,289,871Denominator: 1,771,561,000,000 * 110 = 194,871,710,000,000Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ 207,616,015,289,871 / 194,871,710,000,000 ≈Divide numerator and denominator by 1,000,000,000: ≈ 207,616.015289871 / 194,871.71≈ 207,616.015 / 194,871.71 ≈ Let&#39;s compute that.194,871.71 * 1 = 194,871.71194,871.71 * 1.06 ≈ 194,871.71 + 194,871.71 *0.06 ≈ 194,871.71 + 11,692.30 ≈ 206,564.01Which is close to 207,616.015. So 194,871.71 * 1.065 ≈ 194,871.71 + 194,871.71*0.065 ≈ 194,871.71 + 12,666.66 ≈ 207,538.37Difference between 207,538.37 and 207,616.01 is about 77.64. So 77.64 /194,871.71 ≈ 0.000398. So total ≈ 1.065 + 0.000398 ≈ 1.065398. So approximately 1.0654. So (111/110)^7 ≈ 1.0654. Therefore, the greatest integer not exceeding this is 1. So the answer should be 1. But wait, let me verify once more with a different approach.Alternatively, maybe we can compute ln(111/110) and then multiply by 7 and exponentiate. Let&#39;s try that.First, compute ln(111/110) = ln(1 + 1/110) ≈ 1/110 - 1/(2*110^2) + 1/(3*110^3) - ... Using the Taylor series for ln(1 + x) around x=0. Here x = 1/110 ≈ 0.0090909.So ln(1 + 1/110) ≈ 1/110 - 1/(2*110^2) + 1/(3*110^3) - 1/(4*110^4) + ...Compute first few terms:First term: 1/110 ≈ 0.0090909Second term: -1/(2*110^2) = -1/(2*12100) = -1/24200 ≈ -0.000041322Third term: 1/(3*110^3) = 1/(3*1331000) ≈ 1/3993000 ≈ 0.0000002505Fourth term: -1/(4*110^4) = -1/(4*146410000) ≈ -1/585640000 ≈ -0.000000001707So adding these terms:0.0090909 - 0.000041322 + 0.0000002505 - 0.000000001707 ≈ 0.009049826Therefore, ln(111/110) ≈ 0.009049826.Multiply by 7: 0.009049826 *7 ≈ 0.06334878.Exponentiate: e^0.06334878 ≈ ?Compute e^0.06 ≈ 1.06183654, e^0.06334878. Let&#39;s compute 0.06334878 - 0.06 = 0.00334878. So e^0.06334878 ≈ e^0.06 * e^0.00334878 ≈ 1.06183654 * (1 + 0.00334878 + (0.00334878)^2/2 + ... )Compute e^0.00334878 ≈ 1 + 0.00334878 + (0.00334878)^2/2 ≈ 1 + 0.00334878 + 0.00000561 ≈ 1.00335439Therefore, e^0.06334878 ≈ 1.06183654 * 1.00335439 ≈ 1.06183654 + 1.06183654*0.00335439 ≈ 1.06183654 + 0.003562 ≈ 1.0653985. Which is approximately 1.0654, same as before. Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ e^0.06334878 ≈ 1.0654.So, the value is approximately 1.0654, which is between 1 and 2, so the floor is 1. Therefore, the greatest integer not exceeding it is 1.Wait a second. But is 1.0654 accurate enough? Because if it&#39;s 1.0654, then the integer part is 1, and decimal part is 0.0654. So floor is 1. But let me check with a calculator for exactness.Alternatively, use a calculator. Since I can&#39;t use a calculator, but maybe I can use higher precision.Alternatively, use the previous exact fraction. The exact value is 207,616,015,289,871 / 194,871,710,000,000. Let&#39;s divide numerator by denominator.Divide 207,616,015,289,871 ÷ 194,871,710,000,000.First, divide numerator and denominator by 1,000,000,000 to make it manageable: 207,616.015289871 ÷ 194,871.71So, 194,871.71 * 1 = 194,871.71194,871.71 * 1.06 = 194,871.71 + 194,871.71 * 0.06 = 194,871.71 + 11,692.3026 = 206,564.0126Difference: 207,616.015289871 - 206,564.0126 ≈ 1,052.002689871So, 1,052.002689871 / 194,871.71 ≈ 0.0054So total is approximately 1.06 + 0.0054 = 1.0654, same as before. Therefore, the exact value is approximately 1.0654. So the floor is 1.Therefore, the answer is 1.But wait, let me just check once more to be thorough. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake in assuming that (1/(sinx cosx) - 1) is indeed 111/110 -1 = 1/110. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no: 1/(sinx cosx) is 221/110, so 221/110 -1 = (221 - 110)/110 = 111/110. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So 111/110 is 1.0090909... So 1.0090909...^7. As per the calculations above, yes, approximately 1.0654.Therefore, the greatest integer not exceeding 1.0654 is indeed 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.But just to be 100% sure, let&#39;s cross-verify using logarithms.Let me compute the natural logarithm of (111/110)^7, which is 7*ln(111/110). As before, ln(111/110) ≈ 0.00904982, so multiplied by 7 is ≈ 0.06334874. Then e^0.06334874. Let me use the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.06334874.Wait, but maybe we can use e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120 + x^6/720 + x^7/5040.Wait, x = 0.06334874.Compute e^0.06334874:x = 0.06334874First term: 1Second term: 0.06334874 ≈ 0.06334874Third term: x^2 / 2 ≈ (0.06334874)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.00401308 / 2 ≈ 0.00200654Fourth term: x^3 / 6 ≈ (0.06334874)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.0002543 / 6 ≈ 0.00004238Fifth term: x^4 / 24 ≈ (0.06334874)^4 / 24 ≈ 0.00001616 / 24 ≈ 0.000000673Sixth term: x^5 / 120 ≈ (0.06334874)^5 / 120 ≈ 0.000001025 / 120 ≈ 0.00000000854Higher terms will be negligible.Summing these:1 + 0.06334874 ≈ 1.06334874+ 0.00200654 ≈ 1.06535528+ 0.00004238 ≈ 1.06539766+ 0.000000673 ≈ 1.06539833+ 0.00000000854 ≈ 1.06539834So e^0.06334874 ≈ 1.06539834, which is approximately 1.0654. Therefore, confirming our previous result.Therefore, the value is approximately 1.0654, which is less than 2, so the greatest integer not exceeding it is 1.Hence, the answer is boxed{1}.Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the real number ( x ) satisfies ( 20 sin x = 22 cos x ), we start by dividing both sides by ( cos x ) to get ( 20 tan x = 22 ). Solving for ( tan x ), we find ( tan x = frac{11}{10} ). This implies that ( sin x = frac{11}{sqrt{221}} ) and ( cos x = frac{10}{sqrt{221}} ).Next, we calculate ( sin x cos x ):[sin x cos x = left( frac{11}{sqrt{221}} right) left( frac{10}{sqrt{221}} right) = frac{110}{221}]We then find ( frac{1}{sin x cos x} ):[frac{1}{sin x cos x} = frac{221}{110}]Subtracting 1 from this value gives:[frac{221}{110} - 1 = frac{111}{110}]We need to compute ( left( frac{111}{110} right)^7 ). Using the binomial expansion and approximations, we find:[left( 1 + frac{1}{110} right)^7 approx 1.0654]The greatest integer not exceeding ( 1.0654 ) is 1. Therefore, the answer is:[boxed{1}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I&#39;m given that a real number x satisfies 20 sin x = 22 cos x. Then, I have to find the greatest integer not exceeding the real number (1/(sin x cos x) - 1)^7. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, the equation given is 20 sin x = 22 cos x. That looks like a linear equation in sin x and cos x. Maybe I can express this in terms of tan x? Let me see. If I divide both sides by cos x, assuming cos x ≠ 0, I get 20 tan x = 22. So tan x = 22/20. Simplifying that, tan x = 11/10. So x is an angle whose tangent is 11/10. That makes sense. So x = arctan(11/10) plus some multiple of π, but since we&#39;re dealing with sin x and cos x, the periodicity might not matter here. Let me confirm. Since we need sin x and cos x, maybe we can just work with the reference angle where tan x = 11/10, so x is in the first or third quadrant. But since sin and cos would both be positive or both negative, depending on the quadrant. However, since we&#39;re dealing with 1/(sin x cos x), the sign of sin x cos x will affect the value. Let&#39;s see. If x is in the first quadrant, sin x and cos x are positive, so sin x cos x is positive. If x is in the third quadrant, both sin x and cos x are negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, 1/(sin x cos x) would be positive in both cases. So maybe the quadrant doesn&#39;t affect the value here? Let me note that. So regardless of the quadrant, sin x cos x is positive, so 1/(sin x cos x) is positive. Therefore, maybe we can just proceed with the principal value where x is in the first quadrant. Maybe that&#39;s safe. Let&#39;s proceed.So, tan x = 11/10. So, let&#39;s consider a right triangle where the opposite side is 11 and the adjacent side is 10. Then, the hypotenuse would be sqrt(10^2 + 11^2) = sqrt(100 + 121) = sqrt(221). Therefore, sin x = 11/sqrt(221) and cos x = 10/sqrt(221). Alternatively, if x is in the third quadrant, sin x = -11/sqrt(221) and cos x = -10/sqrt(221). But as we saw earlier, sin x cos x would be positive in both cases. So, sin x cos x = (11/sqrt(221))(10/sqrt(221)) = 110/221. Similarly, in the third quadrant, (-11/sqrt(221))(-10/sqrt(221)) = 110/221. So, sin x cos x is 110/221 in either case.Therefore, 1/(sin x cos x) is 221/110. Then, 1/(sin x cos x) - 1 is 221/110 - 1 = (221 - 110)/110 = 111/110. Therefore, (111/110)^7 is the number we need to compute, and then take the greatest integer not exceeding it, i.e., the floor function.So, the problem reduces to calculating (111/110)^7 and finding its floor. Let&#39;s see. 111/110 is 1 + 1/110, so approximately 1.0090909...To compute (1 + 1/110)^7, we can use the binomial theorem or approximate it step by step. Let&#39;s see. Let me recall that for small h, (1 + h)^n ≈ 1 + nh + n(n-1)h^2/2 + ... But h here is 1/110 ≈ 0.00909, which is small but not extremely small. Let&#39;s see, maybe compute the exact value?Alternatively, compute step by step. Let&#39;s calculate (111/110)^2 first. (111/110)^2 = (111^2)/(110^2). 111^2 is 12321, 110^2 is 12100. So 12321/12100 ≈ 1.0181818...Then, (111/110)^3 = (12321/12100)*(111/110) = (12321*111)/(12100*110). Let me compute numerator and denominator.Numerator: 12321 * 111. Let&#39;s compute 12321 * 100 = 1,232,100; 12321 * 10 = 123,210; 12321 * 1 = 12,321. Adding these up: 1,232,100 + 123,210 = 1,355,310; plus 12,321 is 1,367,631.Denominator: 12100 * 110. 12100 * 100 = 1,210,000; 12100 * 10 = 121,000. Adding them gives 1,210,000 + 121,000 = 1,331,000.Therefore, (111/110)^3 = 1,367,631 / 1,331,000 ≈ 1.0275207...Wait, maybe it&#39;s easier to compute as decimal approximations step by step.First, 111/110 ≈ 1.009090909.Then, (1.009090909)^2 ≈ 1.009090909 * 1.009090909. Let&#39;s compute:1 * 1.009090909 = 1.0090909090.009090909 * 1.009090909 ≈ 0.009090909 * 1 = 0.009090909; 0.009090909 * 0.009090909 ≈ ~0.0000826.So total ≈ 1.009090909 + 0.009090909 + 0.0000826 ≈ 1.0182645. Which matches the exact value of 12321/12100 ≈ 1.0181818... Hmm, my approximation was a bit off. Let&#39;s better compute exact decimal expansions step by step.First, 1.0090909090909... squared. Let&#39;s multiply 1.0090909091 * 1.0090909091.First, 1 * 1.0090909091 = 1.00909090911.0090909091 * 0.0090909091 ≈ 1.0090909091 * 0.009 = 0.0090818182, plus 1.0090909091 * 0.0000909091 ≈ approx 0.000091735. So total ≈ 0.0090818182 + 0.000091735 ≈ 0.009173553. Then total square ≈ 1.0090909091 + 0.009173553 ≈ 1.018264462. The exact value is 12321/12100 ≈ 1.018181818... So my approximation overestimates a bit.But maybe this is getting too detailed. Let&#39;s see. Maybe instead of step-by-step multiplication, use logarithms or exponentials? Alternatively, recognize that (1 + 1/110)^7 can be approximated using the natural exponential function: e^(7/110) ≈ 1 + 7/110 + (7/110)^2/2 + (7/110)^3/6 + ... Let&#39;s try that.Compute 7/110 ≈ 0.063636...So e^0.063636 ≈ 1 + 0.063636 + (0.063636)^2 / 2 + (0.063636)^3 / 6 + (0.063636)^4 / 24 + ...Compute each term:1st term: 12nd term: 0.0636363rd term: (0.063636)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.004049 / 2 ≈ 0.00202454th term: (0.063636)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.000257 / 6 ≈ 0.00004285th term: (0.063636)^4 / 24 ≈ (0.0000164) / 24 ≈ 0.000000683So adding up:1 + 0.063636 = 1.063636+ 0.0020245 = 1.0656605+ 0.0000428 = 1.0657033+ 0.000000683 ≈ 1.065703983So e^0.063636 ≈ 1.065704. However, since (1 + 1/110)^7 is actually slightly larger than e^(7/110) because the binomial expansion includes higher-order terms which are positive. Wait, but actually, the expansion of (1 + h)^n is similar to the exponential, but they are different. However, for small h, they are close. Let me check the actual value. If (1 + 0.0090909)^7 ≈ e^(7*0.0090909) ≈ e^0.063636, which we approximated as 1.0657. But let&#39;s check with actual calculation.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute (111/110)^7 step by step with decimals.First, 111/110 ≈ 1.009090909First power: 1.009090909Second power: (1.009090909)^2 ≈ 1.009090909 * 1.009090909. Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.1.009090909 * 1.009090909:Multiply 1.009090909 by 1 = 1.009090909Multiply 1.009090909 by 0.009090909:First, 1 * 0.009090909 = 0.0090909090.009090909 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.0000826446So total second term: 0.009090909 + 0.0000826446 ≈ 0.0091735536Adding to the first term: 1.009090909 + 0.0091735536 ≈ 1.0182644626So (1.009090909)^2 ≈ 1.01826446Third power: Multiply previous result by 1.009090909.1.01826446 * 1.009090909 ≈ Let&#39;s compute this.1.01826446 * 1 = 1.018264461.01826446 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.009258767Adding together: 1.01826446 + 0.009258767 ≈ 1.02752323So third power ≈ 1.02752323Fourth power: Multiply by 1.009090909 again.1.02752323 * 1 = 1.027523231.02752323 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.009341083Adding: 1.02752323 + 0.009341083 ≈ 1.03686431Fourth power ≈ 1.03686431Fifth power: Multiply by 1.009090909.1.03686431 * 1 = 1.036864311.03686431 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.009426122Adding: 1.03686431 + 0.009426122 ≈ 1.04629043Fifth power ≈ 1.04629043Sixth power: Multiply by 1.009090909.1.04629043 * 1 = 1.046290431.04629043 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.009512640Adding: 1.04629043 + 0.009512640 ≈ 1.05580307Sixth power ≈ 1.05580307Seventh power: Multiply by 1.009090909.1.05580307 * 1 = 1.055803071.05580307 * 0.009090909 ≈ 0.00960003Adding: 1.05580307 + 0.00960003 ≈ 1.0654031So after seven multiplications, the approximate value is 1.0654031. Hmm, earlier with the exponential approximation, we had ≈1.065704. So these are close. But let&#39;s check if my step-by-step multiplication is accurate enough.Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precise intermediate steps. Let&#39;s check the fifth power again. Wait, fifth power was 1.04629043. Let me verify the fifth power calculation.Fourth power was ≈1.03686431. Multiply by 1.009090909:1.03686431 * 1.009090909First, 1.03686431 * 1 = 1.036864311.03686431 * 0.009090909: Let&#39;s compute this more accurately.1.03686431 * 0.009 = 0.009331778791.03686431 * 0.000090909 ≈ 1.03686431 * 0.00009 ≈ 0.0000933178Adding these: 0.00933177879 + 0.0000933178 ≈ 0.0094250966So total fifth power: 1.03686431 + 0.0094250966 ≈ 1.0462894066, which is approximately 1.0462894. So my previous 1.04629043 was slightly off, but negligible.Similarly, sixth power:1.0462894 * 1.0090909091.0462894 * 1 = 1.04628941.0462894 * 0.009090909 ≈ 1.0462894 * 0.009 ≈ 0.009416605; 1.0462894 * 0.000090909 ≈ 0.00009507Total ≈ 0.009416605 + 0.00009507 ≈ 0.009511675Adding to 1.0462894: 1.0462894 + 0.009511675 ≈ 1.055801075Then seventh power:1.055801075 * 1.0090909091.055801075 * 1 = 1.0558010751.055801075 * 0.009090909 ≈ 1.055801075 * 0.009 ≈ 0.00950221; 1.055801075 * 0.000090909 ≈ 0.00009589Total ≈ 0.00950221 + 0.00009589 ≈ 0.0095981Adding to 1.055801075: 1.055801075 + 0.0095981 ≈ 1.065399175So approximately 1.065399. So approximately 1.0654. So the seventh power is approximately 1.0654. Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ 1.0654. Therefore, the greatest integer not exceeding this is 1. So the floor is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1. Wait, but wait, let&#39;s confirm. Is 1.0654 indeed less than 2, so the floor is 1? Yes. But wait, maybe my approximation is missing something? Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a better way to compute (111/110)^7 more accurately. Let&#39;s compute the exact value using fractions. Let&#39;s see, 111/110 is the base. Let&#39;s compute (111/110)^7.First, (111/110)^1 = 111/110 ≈ 1.009090909(111/110)^2 = 111² / 110² = 12321 / 12100 ≈ 1.018181818(111/110)^3 = 111³ / 110³. Let&#39;s compute 111³. 111*111=12321; 12321*111=12321*100 + 12321*10 + 12321*1 = 1,232,100 + 123,210 + 12,321 = 1,367,631. Denominator: 110³=1,331,000. So (111/110)^3 = 1,367,631 / 1,331,000 ≈ 1.02752070Fourth power: (111)^4 / (110)^4. 111^4 = (111^2)^2 = (12321)^2 = let&#39;s compute 12321*12321. Hmm, that&#39;s a big number. Alternatively, use previous numerator: 1,367,631 * 111 = ?1,367,631 * 100 = 136,763,1001,367,631 * 10 = 13,676,3101,367,631 * 1 = 1,367,631Adding them together: 136,763,100 + 13,676,310 = 150,439,410 + 1,367,631 = 151,807,041Denominator: (110)^4 = (110²)^2 = (12,100)^2 = 146,410,000Therefore, (111/110)^4 = 151,807,041 / 146,410,000 ≈ 1.03686431Fifth power: (111)^5 / (110)^5 = 151,807,041 * 111 / (146,410,000 * 110)Numerator: 151,807,041 * 111Let&#39;s compute 151,807,041 * 100 = 15,180,704,100151,807,041 * 10 = 1,518,070,410151,807,041 * 1 = 151,807,041Adding these: 15,180,704,100 + 1,518,070,410 = 16,698,774,510 + 151,807,041 = 16,850,581,551Denominator: 146,410,000 * 110 = 146,410,000*100 + 146,410,000*10 = 14,641,000,000 + 1,464,100,000 = 16,105,100,000Thus, (111/110)^5 ≈ 16,850,581,551 / 16,105,100,000 ≈ 1.0462894Sixth power: (111)^6 / (110)^6 = (16,850,581,551 * 111) / (16,105,100,000 * 110)Numerator: 16,850,581,551 * 11116,850,581,551 * 100 = 1,685,058,155,10016,850,581,551 * 10 = 168,505,815,51016,850,581,551 * 1 = 16,850,581,551Adding these: 1,685,058,155,100 + 168,505,815,510 = 1,853,563,970,610 + 16,850,581,551 = 1,870,414,552,161Denominator: 16,105,100,000 * 110 = 16,105,100,000 * 100 + 16,105,100,000 * 10 = 1,610,510,000,000 + 161,051,000,000 = 1,771,561,000,000Therefore, (111/110)^6 ≈ 1,870,414,552,161 / 1,771,561,000,000 ≈ 1.05580307Seventh power: (111)^7 / (110)^7 = (1,870,414,552,161 * 111) / (1,771,561,000,000 * 110)Numerator: 1,870,414,552,161 * 1111,870,414,552,161 * 100 = 187,041,455,216,1001,870,414,552,161 * 10 = 18,704,145,521,6101,870,414,552,161 * 1 = 1,870,414,552,161Adding these: 187,041,455,216,100 + 18,704,145,521,610 = 205,745,600,737,710 + 1,870,414,552,161 = 207,616,015,289,871Denominator: 1,771,561,000,000 * 110 = 1,771,561,000,000 * 100 + 1,771,561,000,000 * 10 = 177,156,100,000,000 + 17,715,610,000,000 = 194,871,710,000,000Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ 207,616,015,289,871 / 194,871,710,000,000 ≈ Let&#39;s divide numerator and denominator by 1,000,000,000 to simplify: 207,616.015289871 / 194,871.71 ≈Divide numerator and denominator by 194,871.71:≈ (207,616.015289871 / 194,871.71) ≈ 1.065403So the exact fraction is approximately 1.065403.

Therefore, the answer is boxed{1}.Wait, but let me check once more. The value is approximately 1.0654. So the floor is 1. But to confirm, maybe we can compute a better approximation. Let&#39;s use higher precision.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s an error in the previous steps. Let me check the exact fraction:(111/110)^7 = 111^7 / 110^7.111^7 is 207,616,015,289,871110^7 is 194,871,710,000,000So 207,616,015,289,871 divided by 194,871,710,000,000.Let&#39;s perform the division step by step.First, note that 194,871,710,000,000 * 1.06 = 194,871,710,000,000 * 1 + 194,871,710,000,000 * 0.06= 194,871,710,000,000 + 11,692,302,600,000 = 206,564,012,600,000Compare with numerator 207,616,015,289,871.So 1.06 times denominator is 206,564,012,600,000The numerator is 207,616,015,289,871, which is 207,616,015,289,871 - 206,564,012,600,000 = 1,052,002,689,871 more than 1.06 times the denominator.Now, 1,052,002,689,871 divided by denominator 194,871,710,000,000 ≈ 0.0054Therefore, total is approximately 1.06 + 0.0054 = 1.0654. Which matches our previous approximation. Therefore, (111/110)^7 ≈ 1.0654. So the floor is indeed 1.Therefore, the answer is 1. So the greatest integer not exceeding the given expression is boxed{1}.Wait, but let me just check with another approach. Suppose we compute ln(111/110) *7.ln(111/110) = ln(1 + 1/110) ≈ 1/110 - 1/(2*110^2) + 1/(3*110^3) - ...Compute using Taylor series:ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... for |x| &lt; 1.Here, x = 1/110 ≈ 0.0090909.So ln(1 + 1/110) ≈ 1/110 - 1/(2*110²) + 1/(3*110³) - 1/(4*110⁴) + ...Compute each term:1/110 ≈ 0.0090909091/(2*110²) = 1/(2*12100) = 1/24200 ≈ 0.0000413221/(3*110³) = 1/(3*1331000) ≈ 1/3993000 ≈ 0.00000025051/(4*110⁴) ≈ 1/(4*146410000) ≈ 1/585640000 ≈ 0.0000000017So the terms are approximately:0.009090909 - 0.000041322 + 0.0000002505 - 0.0000000017 ≈ 0.009049836Multiply by 7: 0.009049836 * 7 ≈ 0.063348852Exponentiate: e^0.063348852 ≈ ?Again, using Taylor series for e^x around x=0:e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x⁴/24 + x⁵/120 + x⁶/720 + x⁷/5040.x = 0.063348852Compute:1 + 0.063348852 + (0.063348852)^2/2 + (0.063348852)^3/6 + (0.063348852)^4/24 + (0.063348852)^5/120 + (0.063348852)^6/720 + (0.063348852)^7/5040First term: 1Second term: 0.063348852Third term: (0.063348852)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.004013 / 2 ≈ 0.0020065Fourth term: (0.063348852)^3 / 6 ≈ 0.0002543 / 6 ≈ 0.00004238Fifth term: (0.063348852)^4 / 24 ≈ 0.0000161 / 24 ≈ 0.00000067Sixth term: (0.063348852)^5 / 120 ≈ 0.00000102 / 120 ≈ 0.0000000085Seventh term: (0.063348852)^6 / 720 ≈ ~0.000000065 / 720 ≈ ~0.00000000009Eighth term: (0.063348852)^7 / 5040 ≈ negligible.Adding these up:1 + 0.063348852 = 1.063348852+ 0.0020065 = 1.065355352+ 0.00004238 = 1.065397732+ 0.00000067 = 1.065398402+ 0.0000000085 ≈ 1.0653984105So e^0.063348852 ≈ 1.0653984. Which is very close to our previous calculation of 1.065403. So, (111/110)^7 ≈ e^0.063348852 ≈ 1.0653984. Therefore, the value is approximately 1.0653984. So, less than 1.0654. Hence, the floor is 1.Therefore, the answer is indeed 1. So the greatest integer not exceeding the given expression is 1. So the final answer is boxed{1}.Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equation (20 sin x = 22 cos x), we can divide both sides by (cos x) (assuming (cos x neq 0)) to get (20 tan x = 22). Solving for (tan x), we find (tan x = frac{11}{10}). Using a right triangle where the opposite side is 11 and the adjacent side is 10, the hypotenuse is (sqrt{221}). Therefore, (sin x = frac{11}{sqrt{221}}) and (cos x = frac{10}{sqrt{221}}) (or their negatives, but the product (sin x cos x) will be positive in either case). The product (sin x cos x) is:[sin x cos x = left(frac{11}{sqrt{221}}right) left(frac{10}{sqrt{221}}right) = frac{110}{221}]We need to evaluate (left(frac{1}{sin x cos x} - 1right)^7):[frac{1}{sin x cos x} - 1 = frac{221}{110} - 1 = frac{111}{110}]Thus, we need to compute (left(frac{111}{110}right)^7). Approximating step-by-step or using the binomial theorem, we find:[left(frac{111}{110}right)^7 approx 1.0654]The greatest integer not exceeding 1.0654 is 1.

The problem says we can either take one of them or take several different numbers to find their sum, each number can only be used once. It mentions that there are 63 new numbers possible, and when arranged in ascending order, they start as 1, 3, 4, 9, ... The question is asking for the 58th number in this list.First, I need to understand the problem better. We have six numbers: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. Note that there are two 3s here. The process allows us to either take a single number or combine different numbers (without repetition) to make a sum. Each combination gives a new number, and we have to list all possible such sums in ascending order and find the 58th one.Wait, but there are two 3s. Does that mean we can use both 3s in a sum? But the problem says &quot;each number can only be taken once.&quot; Hmm. Wait, but are the two 3s considered different numbers? The problem lists them as separate entries: &quot;1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243.&quot; So maybe each 3 is a distinct element in the set, even though they have the same value. So when combining, you can use each 3 once. So, for example, we could have a sum that includes both 3s, but each 3 is considered a separate number. That complicates things because even though they have the same value, they are distinct elements. So, when forming sums, we can use one or both 3s, but each time only once.But wait, hold on. If we take both 3s, their sum would be 6. So maybe the two 3s allow us to create 6 as a possible sum. But if we didn&#39;t have two 3s, then 6 wouldn&#39;t be possible. So the presence of two 3s adds more possible sums.But the problem says there are a total of 63 new numbers. Let me check: for a set of n elements, the number of subsets is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty set). But here we have 6 elements: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. However, two of them are the same. So how does that affect the number of subsets? If all elements were distinct, it would be 2^6 - 1 = 63. But since two elements are the same, does that reduce the number of unique sums? Wait, but the problem states that 63 new numbers can be obtained. So maybe even with the duplicate 3, the total number of possible sums is still 63. That suggests that the two 3s are considered distinct in terms of being able to choose them, but their sums might not all be unique. However, the problem says 63 new numbers, which is the same as 2^6 - 1. So perhaps the two 3s are treated as different elements, so even though they have the same value, choosing the first 3 or the second 3 or both gives different subsets, but some subsets will result in the same sum. However, the problem states that there are 63 new numbers. That must mean that despite the duplicate 3, all subsets produce unique sums. Wait, but that can&#39;t be true. For example, choosing the first 3 alone and choosing the second 3 alone would both result in the sum 3. Similarly, choosing the first 3 with another number, say 1, would be 1+3=4, and similarly choosing the second 3 with 1 would also be 4. So those would be duplicates. Therefore, the total number of unique sums would be less than 63. However, the problem says &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained,&quot; which contradicts that. Therefore, perhaps the two 3s are considered as a single number? But the problem lists them as separate. Wait, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might have some nuances. But given the problem as stated, with six numbers including two 3s, and getting 63 sums, that seems inconsistent unless duplicates are allowed. Wait, but the problem says &quot;each number can only be taken once,&quot; so when you take numbers, you can&#39;t take the same number more than once. But if there are two 3s, each 3 is a separate number. So perhaps you can take one or both 3s in a sum, but each 3 can only be used once. So for example, if you take both 3s, you get 3+3=6. If you take one 3, you get 3. Therefore, the possible sums include 3 and 6. Therefore, the two 3s allow for more sums than if there was only one 3. So the total number of subsets is 2^6 -1 = 63. But some subsets will have the same sum. But the problem says 63 new numbers, which suggests that all subsets produce unique sums. But that&#39;s impossible because, for example, the subsets {3_1} and {3_2} both sum to 3. Similarly, {3_1, 1} and {3_2, 1} both sum to 4. So those would be duplicates, which would reduce the total number of unique sums. But the problem states that there are 63 new numbers. Therefore, this is a contradiction unless the two 3s are not actually considered separate numbers. Wait, maybe there was a mistranslation or a typo. Perhaps the original problem had numbers with different exponents, but they got translated as 3s. Let me think. If we have numbers 1, 3, 3^1, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5, which would be 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. But no, that&#39;s not making sense. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243, and the two 3s are indeed separate, but when combined, their sum is 6, which is a new number not otherwise present. Therefore, maybe even with duplicates, all the sums are unique. Let&#39;s test that.Let me consider all possible subsets. The numbers are 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. Let&#39;s list some subsets and their sums:- Single numbers: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. But here, the two 3s are duplicates, so the sums here would be 1, 3, 27, 81, 243. So five unique sums here instead of six.- Pairs:1+3=4, 1+3=4 (using the other 3), 1+27=28, 1+81=82, 1+243=244, 3+3=6, 3+27=30, 3+81=84, 3+243=246, 3+27=30, 3+81=84, 3+243=246, 27+81=108, 27+243=270, 81+243=324.So here, some duplicates: 4 (twice), 6 (once), 28 (twice?), no, wait, 1+3 is 4, and 1+ the other 3 is also 4. Similarly, 3+27 is 30, and the other 3+27 is 30. Similarly, 3+81 is 84, and the other 3+81 is 84. Similarly with 3+243. So the pairs would have sums: 4, 4, 6, 28, 30, 30, 82, 84, 84, 244, 246, 246, 108, 270, 324. So unique sums here are 4, 6, 28, 30, 82, 84, 244, 246, 108, 270, 324. So 11 unique sums, but considering duplicates, but original pairs would be 15 (since C(6,2) = 15, but with duplicates). So even at the pair level, there are duplicates. Therefore, the total unique sums would be fewer than 63.But the problem says there are 63 new numbers. That suggests that all subsets have unique sums. Therefore, there must be something wrong in my understanding.Wait, perhaps the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. Because those are the powers of 3, and each is 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5. Then, each number is distinct, and any subset would have a unique sum. Because in the binary representation, each power of 3 is unique, and sums would correspond to numbers in base 3. For example, numbers formed by sums of distinct powers of 3 would be unique, similar to binary numbers. So maybe the problem had a typo, and the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. But the original problem lists two 3s. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese, and the numbers are written differently. Let me check the original problem again.The problem says: &quot;There are 6 numbers: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. Each time, you can either take one of them, or take several different numbers to find their sum (each number can only be taken once, which can result in a new number). This way, a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained. If they are arranged in ascending order, they are 1, 3, 4, 9, ... What is the 58th number?&quot;Wait, 63 numbers would be the case if all subsets except the empty set are considered, and each gives a unique sum. So 2^6 -1 =63. Therefore, the problem is asserting that all subsets (excluding empty) of these six numbers have unique sums, even with two 3s. But that seems impossible because subsets containing one 3 or the other 3 would have the same sum. Unless... Wait, maybe &quot;taking several different numbers&quot; means that you can&#39;t take multiple copies of the same number. Wait, the original problem says &quot;each number can only be taken once,&quot; which might mean that when you take a number, you can&#39;t take it again. But in the given numbers, there are two 3s. So if they are considered different numbers, then you can take both 3s once each, resulting in a sum of 6. But if they are considered the same number, you can&#39;t take both. But the problem lists them as separate numbers, so perhaps you can take both 3s. Therefore, the total number of subsets is 2^6 -1 =63. But this would require that all subsets have distinct sums. Let&#39;s check that.Suppose we have two 3s. Then, subsets can include 0, 1, or 2 copies of 3. Wait, no, the numbers are 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So each element is unique, even if they have the same value. So when forming a subset, you can choose to include the first 3, the second 3, both, or neither. Similarly for the others. So the total subsets are indeed 2^6 =64, minus 1 for the empty set, giving 63. However, the sums may not all be unique. For example, the subset {3_1} and {3_2} both sum to 3. Similarly, subsets {1, 3_1} and {1, 3_2} both sum to 4. Therefore, those are duplicates. Therefore, the problem statement that &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot; must be incorrect. But since the problem states that, maybe in this specific case, despite the duplicate 3s, all sums are unique. How is that possible?Wait, let&#39;s think again. If we have two 3s, then the possible sums can include 3 (from one 3) and 6 (from both 3s). So even though the individual 3s are the same, combining them gives a different sum. Therefore, maybe when considering all subsets, even with duplicates, the sums turn out to be unique. Let&#39;s try to check some sums.Single numbers: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So sums here are 1, 3, 27, 81, 243 (duplicate 3s, so two subsets sum to 3).Pairs:1+3=4, 1+3=4 (using the other 3), 1+27=28, 1+81=82, 1+243=244, 3+3=6, 3+27=30, 3+81=84, 3+243=246, 3+27=30, 3+81=84, 3+243=246, 27+81=108, 27+243=270, 81+243=324.So in pairs, sums are 4 (twice), 6 (once), 28 (once), 30 (twice), 82 (once), 84 (twice), 244 (once), 246 (twice), 108 (once), 270 (once), 324 (once). So unique sums here are 4, 6, 28, 30, 82, 84, 244, 246, 108, 270, 324. So 11 unique sums from pairs, but some duplicates.Triplets:1+3+3=7, 1+3+27=31, 1+3+27=31, 1+3+81=85, 1+3+81=85, 1+3+243=247, 1+3+243=247, 1+3+27=31 (using the other 3), etc. This is getting complicated, but clearly, there are duplicates here too.Therefore, the total number of unique sums is definitely less than 63. Therefore, the problem&#39;s assertion that there are 63 new numbers must be incorrect unless the two 3s are actually different numbers. Wait, maybe they aren&#39;t two 3s. Maybe it&#39;s a translation error. Perhaps the original problem had 1, 3, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5, which would be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. Then, all numbers are distinct, and each subset sum is unique because each is a power of 3. In that case, the number of subsets is 63, and all sums are unique. Then, when arranged in ascending order, they form numbers from 1 up to 1+3+9+27+81+243=364. Each number would correspond to a unique combination of the powers of 3, similar to binary digits but in base 3. But in that case, the 58th number would be calculated based on their binary representations. However, the problem as stated includes two 3s, not a 9. So maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement, and it should be 9 instead of the second 3. If that&#39;s the case, then the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, and all subsets have unique sums, totaling 63. Then, arranging them in order, the 58th number would be the 6th largest number, since 63 - 58 +1 =6. So the 6th largest number is 243 +81+27+9+3+1= 364, then subtract 1, 3, 4, etc. Wait, but if all subsets are unique, then the numbers are ordered from 1 to 364, but not all numbers in between are present. Each number is a sum of distinct powers of 3. Wait, actually, sums of distinct powers of 3 correspond to numbers in base 2 but interpreted in base 3. For example, each bit in a binary number represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a power of 3. Therefore, the numbers would be 1, 3, 4 (1+3), 9, 10 (1+9), 12 (3+9), 13 (1+3+9), 27, etc. So the sequence is 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, ..., up to 364. Therefore, the numbers are ordered as per the combinations of the powers of 3. In such a case, the numbers correspond to binary counting where each digit represents a power of 3. Therefore, the k-th number in the ordered list corresponds to the binary representation of k-1 (since we start from 1) with digits representing powers of 3.But if the original problem had two 3s instead of a 9, this reasoning falls apart. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo. Given that the user wrote &quot;1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243,&quot; but perhaps it should be &quot;1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243.&quot; That would make sense, as those are the powers of 3, and each combination would give a unique sum. Then, the total number of subsets is 63, which matches the problem statement. The initial terms given in the problem are 1, 3, 4, 9, which fits with the sums of powers of 3: 1, 3, 1+3=4, 9, 1+9=10, 3+9=12, 1+3+9=13, etc. So the problem likely intended the numbers to be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, with no duplicates. Then, the rest of the solution follows.Assuming that, then the 58th number would be the 58th number in the ordered list of subset sums of these powers of 3. To find the 58th number, since there are 63 numbers total, the 58th number is the 6th number from the end (since 63 - 58 +1 =6). The largest number is the sum of all numbers: 1+3+9+27+81+243= 364. The next largest would be 364 -1=363, then 364 -3=361, then 364 -4=360, then 364 -9=355, then 364 -10=354, etc. Wait, but actually, the numbers are ordered from smallest to largest, so the 63rd number is 364, the 62nd is 364 -1=363, the 61st is 364 -3=361, the 60th is 364 -4=360, the 59th is 364 -9=355, the 58th is 364 -10=354. Wait, but let&#39;s confirm this.Alternatively, since each number corresponds to a binary number where each bit represents the inclusion of a power of 3. For example, the numbers can be represented as 6-bit binary numbers, where each bit corresponds to 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. Then, the value is the sum of the powers of 3 where the bits are set. To get the numbers in ascending order, we can list them by treating the binary numbers from 000001 to 111111 (binary 1 to 63) and interpreting them as which powers of 3 to include. However, the order isn&#39;t strictly increasing with the binary count because higher bits can influence the sum more. For example, the number 243 is much larger than the sum of all smaller powers. Therefore, to list the numbers in ascending order, you can generate all possible subset sums and sort them. But doing this manually up to the 58th term would be tedious. However, since each power of 3 is significantly larger than the sum of all previous ones, the ordering is similar to binary counting but in base 3. Specifically, each new power of 3 is greater than the sum of all previous powers. For example:3^0 =13^1 =3 &gt;13^2 =9 &gt;1+3=43^3=27 &gt;1+3+9=133^4=81 &gt;1+3+9+27=403^5=243 &gt;1+3+9+27+81=121Therefore, each new power of 3 is greater than the sum of all previous ones. This property ensures that when generating subset sums, the presence of a higher power will always result in a larger number than any combination without it. Therefore, the ordering of subset sums can be constructed by considering the inclusion or exclusion of each power starting from the largest. So the list would first include all subset sums without 243, then all subset sums with 243. Similarly, within the subsets without 243, they can be divided into those without 81 and those with 81, and so on.But this might be a bit abstract. Alternatively, think of it as similar to binary numbers where each digit represents a power of 3. The key is that each subsequent power is significantly larger, so the ordering is determined first by the highest power included.Given this, the numbers can be generated in order by considering combinations starting from the smallest power and adding higher powers as needed. However, manually generating 58 numbers would take a long time.Alternatively, note that each number can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 3, similar to binary representation. Therefore, each number from 1 to 364 can be represented in a binary-like form where each digit is 0 or 1, but each position represents a power of 3. However, not all numbers can be represented this way; only those that are sums of distinct powers of 3. Therefore, the sequence is the list of all such numbers in ascending order.Given that, the problem reduces to finding the 58th number in this list. Since there are 63 numbers total (from 1 to 364), the 58th number is the 6th number from the end. The largest number is 364 (sum of all). The next ones would be:63rd: 36462nd: 364 -1 =36361st: 364 -3 =36160th: 364 - (1+3) =364 -4=36059th: 364 -9 =35558th: 364 - (9+1)=354 or 364 -10=354Wait, but let&#39;s check:The numbers can be considered as all subsets. The total number is 63. To get the reverse order, starting from the largest:1. 243 +81 +27 +9 +3 +1=3642. 243 +81 +27 +9 +3=363 (without 1)3. 243 +81 +27 +9 +1=361 (without 3)4. 243 +81 +27 +9=360 (without 3 and 1)5. 243 +81 +27 +3 +1=355 (without 9)6. 243 +81 +27 +3=354 (without 9 and 1)Therefore, the 58th number is 354.But let&#39;s verify this step by step. The idea is that each time we remove the smallest possible elements to get the next lower number.Starting from 364:- Subtract 1: 363 (62nd)- Subtract 3 (since 1 is already subtracted, next is subtract 3): 364 -3=361 (61st)- Subtract 1+3=4: 364 -4=360 (60th)- Subtract 9: 364 -9=355 (59th)- Subtract 9 +1=10: 364 -10=354 (58th)But wait, is that the correct order? Because when you have multiple subsets, the ordering isn&#39;t necessarily just subtracting the smaller numbers. For example, after 364, the next largest number is 364 -1=363, then 364 -3=361, then 364 -1 -3=360, then 364 -9=355, then 364 -9 -1=354, then 364 -9 -3=352, then 364 -9 -3 -1=351, then 364 -27=337, etc. However, this approach may not capture the correct order because some numbers between 351 and 355 may be formed by other combinations. For example, 243 +81 +27 +3 +1=355, and the next one down would be 243 +81 +27 +3=354, then 243 +81 +27 +1=352, then 243 +81 +27=351, then 243 +81 +9 +3 +1=337? Wait, no. Wait, 243 +81 +9 +3 +1=243+81=324, 324+9=333, 333+3=336, 336+1=337. But 337 is less than 351, so actually, the order would require careful consideration.This suggests that the method of subtracting the smallest components may not work because the next largest number after 364 could be formed by omitting a different combination. For example, after 364 (all numbers included), the next largest is 364 -1=363 (excluding 1), then 364 -3=361 (excluding 3), then 364 -1 -3=360 (excluding 1 and 3), then 364 -9=355 (excluding 9), then 364 -9 -1=354 (excluding 9 and 1), then 364 -9 -3=352 (excluding 9 and 3), then 364 -9 -1 -3=351 (excluding 9,1,3), then 364 -27=337 (excluding 27), etc. However, between 351 and 355, there might be numbers formed by excluding 27 and including smaller numbers. Wait, but 243 +81 +9 +3 +1=337, which is less than 351. So no, actually, the numbers formed by excluding higher powers will be significantly smaller.Wait, perhaps the correct order after 364 is:364 (all)363 (without 1)361 (without 3)360 (without 1 and 3)355 (without 9)354 (without 9 and 1)352 (without 9 and 3)351 (without 9,1,3)337 (without 27)336 (without 27 and 1)334 (without 27 and 3)333 (without 27,1,3)325 (without 27 and 9)324 (without 27,9,1)322 (without 27,9,3)321 (without 27,9,1,3)... and so on.But this seems to be a pattern where each time we exclude the next higher power and include the smaller ones. However, this is getting complex. Alternatively, since each power of 3 is greater than the sum of all lower ones, the numbers can be ordered by the highest power they contain. So all numbers containing 243 come after all numbers without 243. Similarly, within the numbers containing 243, those containing 81 come after those without, etc.Therefore, to generate the numbers in ascending order:1. Start with subsets not containing 243.   a. These subsets are formed by 1,3,9,27,81. There are 31 such subsets (2^5 -1=31). Their sums range from 1 to 1+3+9+27+81=121.2. Then, the subsets containing 243.   a. These are formed by adding 243 to each of the subsets from the previous step. Therefore, the sums range from 243+1=244 up to 243+121=364. There are 32 such subsets (including 243 alone, which is 243).But wait, 2^5=32 subsets when including 243. Therefore, total subsets are 31 +32=63. However, the numbers are ordered first by the subsets without 243 (1 to 121) and then by subsets with 243 (244 to 364). Therefore, the first 31 numbers are 1 to 121, and the next 32 numbers are 244 to 364. Therefore, the 58th number is within the second group (subsets with 243). Specifically, 58 -31=27th number in the second group. So the 27th number after 243.But the second group goes from 244 (243+1) up to 364 (243+121). The numbers in the second group are exactly the numbers from the first group plus 243. Therefore, the ordering of the second group is the same as the ordering of the first group but shifted by 243. Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 243 plus the 27th number in the first group.Therefore, we need to find the 27th number in the first group (subsets without 243, sums from 1 to 121) and then add 243 to it to get the 58th number overall.Now, the first group consists of the subsets of {1,3,9,27,81}. Let&#39;s focus on generating the first 31 numbers here. Similarly, since each power is greater than the sum of the previous ones, the ordering within the first group is similar:1. Start with subsets not containing 81.   a. These are subsets of {1,3,9,27}. There are 15 subsets (2^4 -1=15). Their sums range from 1 to 1+3+9+27=40.2. Then, subsets containing 81.   a. These are subsets of {1,3,9,27} with 81 added. There are 16 subsets (including 81 alone). Their sums range from 81 to 81+40=121.Therefore, the first 15 numbers in the first group are from 1 to 40, and the next 16 numbers are from 81 to 121. Therefore, the 27th number in the first group is in the subsets containing 81. Specifically, 27 -15=12th number in the subsets containing 81. These subsets are the first group&#39;s subsets (1 to 40) plus 81. So the 12th number in this subset is 81 + the 12th number in the first subgroup (subsets of {1,3,9,27}).Now, we need to find the 12th number in the subsets of {1,3,9,27} (sums from 1 to 40). Let&#39;s break it down further.Subsets of {1,3,9,27}:1. Subsets not containing 27.   a. Subsets of {1,3,9}. There are 7 subsets (2^3 -1=7). Sums from 1 to 1+3+9=13.2. Subsets containing 27.   a. Subsets of {1,3,9} with 27 added. There are 8 subsets (including 27 alone). Sums from 27 to 27+13=40.Therefore, the first 7 numbers in the subsets of {1,3,9,27} are 1 to 13, and the next 8 are 27 to 40. The 12th number is in the subsets containing 27. Specifically, 12 -7=5th number in the subsets containing 27. These are 27 + subsets of {1,3,9}. The 5th number here is 27 + the 5th number in the subsets of {1,3,9}.Now, subsets of {1,3,9}:1. Subsets not containing 9.   a. Subsets of {1,3}. There are 3 subsets: 1,3,4 (1+3).2. Subsets containing 9.   a. Subsets of {1,3} with 9 added. There are 4 subsets: 9, 10 (1+9), 12 (3+9), 13 (1+3+9).Therefore, the subsets of {1,3,9} in order are:1: 12: 33: 44: 95: 106: 127: 13So the 5th number is 10. Therefore, the 5th number in the subsets containing 27 is 27 +10=37. Therefore, the 12th number in the subsets of {1,3,9,27} is 37. Therefore, the 12th number in the subsets containing 81 is 81 +37=118. Therefore, the 27th number in the first group (subsets without 243) is 118. Therefore, the 58th number overall is 243 +118=361.Wait, but let&#39;s verify this step by step:Original problem: Find the 58th number when arranging all subset sums of {1,3,9,27,81,243} in ascending order.Total numbers:63First 31 numbers: subsets without 243 (sums 1-121)Next 32 numbers: subsets with 243 (sums 244-364)58th number is in the second group, position 58 -31=27.Second group numbers: each is 243 + (sum from first group). So 27th number in second group is 243 + 27th number in first group.First group: subsets of {1,3,9,27,81} (sums 1-121). First 15 numbers: subsets without 81 (sums 1-40). Next 16 numbers: subsets with 81 (sums 81-121). 27th number in first group: 27 -15=12th number in subsets with 81.Subsets with 81: sums are 81 + subsets of {1,3,9,27}. The 12th number here is 81 + 12th number in subsets of {1,3,9,27}.Subsets of {1,3,9,27}:First 7 numbers: subsets without 27 (1-13). Next 8 numbers: subsets with 27 (27-40). 12th number in subsets of {1,3,9,27}: 12 -7=5th number in subsets with 27.Subsets with 27: sums are 27 + subsets of {1,3,9}. The 5th number here is 27 +5th number in subsets of {1,3,9}.Subsets of {1,3,9}:First 3 numbers: 1,3,4. Next 4 numbers:9,10,12,13. The 5th number is 10.Therefore, 27 +10=37. Therefore, subsets with 81 +37=118. Therefore, the 58th number is 243 +118=361.But wait, when we list the subsets with 243, the 27th number in that group would be 243 +118=361. However, according to the earlier subtraction method, the 61st number was 361. Which is conflicting.Wait, perhaps there was a miscalculation. Let&#39;s re-express:Total numbers:63First 31 numbers:1-121 (without 243)Next 32 numbers:244-364 (with 243)58th number is in the second group at position 58 -31=27.Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 243 + (27th number in first group).First group has 31 numbers. The first group&#39;s 27th number is found as follows:First group is subsets of {1,3,9,27,81}.First 15 numbers: subsets without 81 (sums 1-40)Next 16 numbers: subsets with 81 (sums 81-121)Therefore, 27th number in first group is in the subsets with 81: position 27 -15=12.Subsets with 81 are 81 + subsets of {1,3,9,27}. So 12th number here is 81 + 12th number in subsets of {1,3,9,27}.Subsets of {1,3,9,27}:First 7 numbers: subsets without 27 (sums 1-13)Next 8 numbers: subsets with 27 (sums 27-40)12th number in subsets of {1,3,9,27} is in subsets with 27: position 12 -7=5.Subsets with 27 are 27 + subsets of {1,3,9}. The 5th number here is 27 +5th number in subsets of {1,3,9}.Subsets of {1,3,9}:First 3 numbers:1,3,4Next 4 numbers:9,10,12,135th number is 10.Therefore, 27 +10=37.Then, 81 +37=118.Therefore, the 27th number in the first group is 118.Thus, the 58th number is 243 +118=361.But earlier, when I considered the reverse order, I thought the 58th number was 354. There&#39;s a discrepancy here. Which is correct?Let&#39;s cross-verify. If the 58th number is 361, which is 243 +118. What is 118 in the first group?In the first group (subsets without 243), 118 is the sum of 81 +27 +10=81+27+10=118. Wait, but 10 is 1+9. So 81+27+1+9=118. So the subset {1,9,27,81}. Yes, that sum is 1+9+27+81=118. Then adding 243 gives 361.But earlier, when I thought of the reverse order, I had:63:36462:36361:36160:36059:35558:354But according to the binary-like generation, the 58th number is 361. There&#39;s a conflict.This suggests that the approach of counting in reverse by subtracting the smallest components may not account for the correct ordering because higher components can be excluded, leading to larger drops in the sum. Whereas the method of breaking down the subsets systematically gives 361 as the 58th number.To resolve this, let&#39;s try to list the numbers in the second group (with 243) in ascending order:The second group consists of all subsets that include 243. Each such subset is 243 plus a subset of {1,3,9,27,81}. The subsets of {1,3,9,27,81} are ordered from 1 to 121, so adding 243 to each of these gives numbers from 244 to 364. Therefore, the numbers in the second group are exactly the numbers from the first group shifted by 243. Therefore, the order of the second group is the same as the order of the first group but with 243 added. Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 243 plus the 27th number in the first group.Since the first group&#39;s 27th number is 118, the 27th number in the second group is 243+118=361. Therefore, the 58th number overall is 361.However, when I tried to subtract components from 364, I thought the 58th number was 354, but that method was flawed because it assumes that subtracting the smallest components sequentially gives the correct order, which isn&#39;t the case. The correct method is to realize that the second group&#39;s order mirrors the first group&#39;s order plus 243.Therefore, the correct answer should be 361.But let&#39;s verify with a small example. Suppose we have a smaller set: {1,3,9}. The subsets are:1,3,4,9,10,12,13. Ordered:1,3,4,9,10,12,13.If we add 27 to each subset, we get:28,30,31,36,37,39,40. Ordered:28,30,31,36,37,39,40.So the combined list is:1,3,4,9,10,12,13,28,30,31,36,37,39,40.Here, the 8th number is 28, which is 27+1.Similarly, in the original problem, the second group&#39;s order is the same as the first group&#39;s order shifted by 243. Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 243 + the 27th number in the first group, which we found to be 118, so 243+118=361.To confirm, let&#39;s see what 118 is in the first group. 118 is the sum of 81+27+9+1=118. So the subset {1,9,27,81}. Adding 243 gives {1,9,27,81,243}, sum=361.But is there a number between 355 and 361 in the second group?For example, 243+81+27+3+1=355, 243+81+27+9=360, 243+81+27+9+1=361. Wait, no:Wait, 243+81+27+9+1=243+81=324, 324+27=351, 351+9=360, 360+1=361. So 361 is the sum of 243+81+27+9+1.But 243+81+27+3+1=243+81=324, 324+27=351, 351+3=354, 354+1=355.Then 243+81+27+9=360.Then 243+81+27+9+1=361.So between 355 and 361, there is 360. Therefore, the ordering after 355 would be 360, then 361. Therefore, if the 59th number is 355, the 60th is 360, and the 61st is 361. But according to our previous calculation, the 58th number is 361. This suggests inconsistency.Wait, but according to the systematic breakdown:First group (without 243):31 numbers, 1-121.Second group (with 243):32 numbers, 244-364.58-31=27. So the 27th number in the second group.The second group&#39;s numbers are ordered as 244, 246, 247, 252, 253, 255, 256, 270, 272, 273, 279, 280, 282, 283, 324, 325, 327, 328, 334, 335, 337, 338, 351, 352, 354, 355, 360, 361, 363, 364.Wait, this seems arbitrary. Let&#39;s try to list some numbers in the second group:Starting with the smallest:244 (243+1)246 (243+3)247 (243+1+3)252 (243+9)253 (243+1+9)255 (243+3+9)256 (243+1+3+9)270 (243+27)272 (243+1+27)273 (243+3+27)274 (243+1+3+27)279 (243+9+27)280 (243+1+9+27)282 (243+3+9+27)283 (243+1+3+9+27)324 (243+81)325 (243+1+81)327 (243+3+81)328 (243+1+3+81)334 (243+9+81)335 (243+1+9+81)337 (243+3+9+81)338 (243+1+3+9+81)351 (243+27+81)352 (243+1+27+81)354 (243+3+27+81)355 (243+1+3+27+81)360 (243+9+27+81)361 (243+1+9+27+81)363 (243+3+9+27+81)364 (243+1+3+9+27+81)Wait, this list shows the second group numbers in ascending order. Let&#39;s count them:1:2442:2463:2474:2525:2536:2557:2568:2709:27210:27311:27412:27913:28014:28215:28316:32417:32518:32719:32820:33421:33522:33723:33824:35125:35226:35427:35528:36029:36130:36331:364Wait, but according to this list, the 27th number in the second group is 355, and the 28th is 360, 29th is 361, 30th is 363, 31st is 364. But we have only 31 numbers in the second group? Wait, no, the second group should have 32 numbers because subsets of {1,3,9,27,81} include 32 subsets (2^5=32). Therefore, my listing above is missing some numbers. Let&#39;s recount.When we have subsets of {1,3,9,27,81}, there are 32 subsets including the empty set. But since we are considering non-empty subsets in the first group (31 numbers), the second group (subsets with 243) should also have 31 numbers (each non-empty subset of the first group plus 243). However, the problem states that there are 63 numbers in total, which is 31 (without 243) +32 (with 243) =63. Wait, that suggests that the subsets with 243 include the empty set plus 243. Therefore, 243 itself is included. Therefore, the second group has 32 numbers: 243 plus 31 subsets from the first group. Therefore, the second group starts with 243 (alone), then 243+1=244, 243+3=246, etc.Therefore, correcting the list:1:2432:2443:2464:2475:2526:2537:2558:2569:27010:27211:27312:27413:27914:28015:28216:28317:32418:32519:32720:32821:33422:33523:33724:33825:35126:35227:35428:35529:36030:36131:36332:364Now, in this corrected list, the second group (with 243) has 32 numbers. The first number is 243, then 244, etc.Therefore, the 58th number overall is the 27th number in the second group. Looking at the list above:1:243 (58-31=27th in second group is 27th entry here)But wait, the second group has 32 numbers, so the 27th number in the second group is:1:2432:2443:2464:2475:2526:2537:2558:2569:27010:27211:27312:27413:27914:28015:28216:28317:32418:32519:32720:32821:33422:33523:33724:33825:35126:35227:35428:35529:36030:36131:36332:364Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 354. Therefore, the 58th number overall is 354.But earlier, through the systematic breakdown, we arrived at 361. This discrepancy arises because the initial approach didn&#39;t account for the empty set. Wait, no. The total subsets excluding the empty set are 63. The second group includes all subsets that contain 243, which would be 32 subsets (including the subset that contains only 243). Therefore, when the second group is ordered, the numbers are as listed above, with 243 as the first number in the second group.Therefore, the 27th number in the second group is 354, which corresponds to the 58th number overall. Therefore, the correct answer is 354.To confirm, let&#39;s count:First group (1-121):31 numbers (1st to 31st)Second group (243-364):32 numbers (32nd to 63rd)58th number is the (58-31)=27th in the second group.Looking at the second group list:1:243 (32nd overall)2:244 (33rd)3:246 (34th)4:247 (35th)5:252 (36th)6:253 (37th)7:255 (38th)8:256 (39th)9:270 (40th)10:272 (41st)11:273 (42nd)12:274 (43rd)13:279 (44th)14:280 (45th)15:282 (46th)16:283 (47th)17:324 (48th)18:325 (49th)19:327 (50th)20:328 (51st)21:334 (52nd)22:335 (53rd)23:337 (54th)24:338 (55th)25:351 (56th)26:352 (57th)27:354 (58th)Therefore, the 58th number is 354.This matches the earlier reverse subtraction method where the 58th number was thought to be 354. The systematic approach initially had a flaw because it didn&#39;t consider that the second group includes the subset {243} alone as the first element, shifting all other numbers by one.Therefore, the correct answer is 354.But let&#39;s confirm this sum:243 +3 +27 +81=243+3=246, 246+27=273, 273+81=354. Yes, 243+3+27+81=354. This is the subset {3,27,81,243}.Therefore, the 58th number is 354, which is boxed as boxed{354}.Final Answerboxed{354}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of finding the 58th number in the sequence obtained by summing subsets of the numbers 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243, we need to consider the following steps:1. Understanding the Problem: The numbers given are 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. Each number can be used once in a subset sum. The total number of subsets (excluding the empty set) is (2^6 - 1 = 63). However, due to the duplicate 3, some sums will be duplicates. The problem states there are 63 unique sums, implying a possible typo where the numbers should be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 (powers of 3), ensuring all subset sums are unique.2. Correcting the Numbers: Assuming the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 (powers of 3), each subset sum is unique. The total number of subsets is 63, and the sums range from 1 to 364.3. Ordering the Subset Sums: The numbers are ordered by their sums. The largest sum is 364 (sum of all numbers). The numbers are divided into two groups: those without 243 (sums 1-121) and those with 243 (sums 244-364).4. Finding the 58th Number:   - The first 31 numbers (1-121) are sums without 243.   - The next 32 numbers (244-364) are sums with 243.   - The 58th number is the 27th number in the second group (since 58 - 31 = 27).5. Generating the Second Group:   - The second group numbers are 243 plus each subset sum of the first group.   - Listing the second group numbers in ascending order, the 27th number is 354 (243 + 3 + 27 + 81).Thus, the 58th number in the ascending order of subset sums is (boxed{354}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out the 58th number in the sequence when we can take either individual numbers or sums of different numbers from the original set {1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243}. Each number can only be used once in each sum, and apparently, this gives a total of 63 possible numbers. They are arranged in ascending order, starting with 1, 3, 4, 9, ..., and I need to find the 58th one. First, let me understand the problem correctly. We have six numbers, but two of them are the same (the two 3s). However, when taking sums, each number can be used only once. But wait, there&#39;s a catch here. If there are two 3s, does that mean we can use 3 twice in a sum? Wait, the problem says &quot;each number can only be taken once, which can result in a new number.&quot; Hmm. Maybe the two 3s are considered different numbers? But they are both 3. Wait, maybe the original set is {1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243}, so there are duplicates. But when forming sums, each number can be taken only once. But how does that work with duplicates? For example, can we take both 3s in a sum? If they are considered different, then maybe. But if they are considered the same, then we can&#39;t. Wait, the problem says &quot;each time, you can either take one of them, or take several different numbers to find their sum (each number can only be taken once, which can result in a new number).&quot; So the key here is &quot;different numbers&quot; and &quot;each number can only be taken once&quot;. So even though there are two 3s, since they are different numbers (but have the same value), can they be used together in a sum? For example, can I take both 3s and sum them to get 6? If that&#39;s allowed, then the presence of duplicates allows for certain sums that wouldn&#39;t be possible with a single instance. But if duplicates are considered the same number, then you can&#39;t. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.Wait, the original set is given as 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So there are two 3s. The rest are unique. When it says &quot;each number can only be taken once&quot;, does that mean each instance? So if there are two 3s, each is a separate number. Therefore, you can take both 3s in a sum, resulting in 6. However, if you take one 3, you can&#39;t take the other 3 in the same sum. Wait, no: each number is considered separate, so each 3 is a different element. Therefore, you can take both 3s in the same sum, so 3 + 3 = 6. But wait, since they are separate elements, even though they have the same value, you can combine them. So for example, the possible sums would include 1, 3, 3, 1+3=4, 1+3=4 (using the other 3), 3+3=6, 27, 1+27=28, 3+27=30, 3+27=30, 1+3+27=31, 1+3+27=31, 3+3+27=33, etc. But wait, but in set theory, sets don&#39;t have duplicate elements. However, in this problem, it&#39;s a multiset because there are two 3s. So maybe the problem is treating it as a multiset, allowing multiple instances of the same number. Therefore, when forming sums, you can use each element once, even if they have the same value. Therefore, the two 3s can be used separately or together.Therefore, for example, using both 3s would give 6, which is a unique number. So in that case, the possible sums include combinations where we can have two 3s. That changes things. So we can have sums like 3 + 3 = 6, 1 + 3 + 3 = 7, and so on. So the two 3s can be used as separate elements, so when constructing subsets, we can choose either 0, 1, or 2 of them, similar to other numbers but with limited quantity.Wait, but actually, in subset sums, even if there are duplicates, each element is considered unique. But in this case, since the problem presents them as separate numbers (i.e., the original numbers include two 3s), then they can be used as separate elements. Therefore, when forming sums, each 3 is a separate element, so you can include either one or both. Therefore, the total number of possible subsets is 2^6 = 64, but since we can&#39;t take the empty set, it&#39;s 63. Hence, 63 new numbers (including the original numbers). The problem says &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;, so that includes all possible non-empty subsets. So each non-empty subset corresponds to a sum, and these sums are arranged in ascending order. The 58th number is the one we need to find.However, the problem statement mentions that when arranged in ascending order, they start with 1, 3, 4, 9, ... So let&#39;s check: the smallest number is 1. Then 3. Then 4 (1+3). But there&#39;s another 3. So maybe the order is 1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 9, etc. Wait, but if the two 3s are considered separate, then the individual numbers would include two 3s, so the sorted list would have 1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 9, ... But the problem says &quot;arranged in ascending order, they are 1, 3, 4, 9, ...&quot;. So that suggests that duplicates are removed. Because otherwise, after 1, you would have two 3s. But the problem lists them as 1, 3, 4, 9, ..., so perhaps even though there are two 3s in the original set, when you form all possible sums, duplicates are considered only once. Therefore, each sum is unique. Therefore, even though you can create 3 in two different ways (either taking the first 3 or the second 3), the number 3 is only counted once in the list. Therefore, when they say 63 new numbers, they must mean 63 unique numbers. So the two 3s only contribute one instance of 3 to the list. Therefore, when forming the sums, even if there are multiple subsets that result in the same sum, we only count each sum once. Therefore, the problem is about the set of unique subset sums, ordered ascendingly, and we need to find the 58th element.So the total number of subsets is 2^6 = 64. Minus the empty set, so 63 subsets. But if some subsets have the same sum, then the number of unique sums would be less than 63. However, the problem states that &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;, which suggests that all subset sums are unique. Wait, but that&#39;s conflicting with the given example of 3 appearing twice. But maybe the two 3s are considered different, so when you take either one of them, it&#39;s considered different subsets but same sum, but the problem counts them as one number. Therefore, even though there are 63 subsets, some sums repeat, leading to fewer unique numbers. But the problem says &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe the original numbers are 6, each can be taken once, but when forming sums, you can take different numbers (so each number is used at most once in each sum). Therefore, the total number of possible sums is 63 (since each number is either included or not, except the empty set). But in this case, if there are duplicate numbers (the two 3s), some subsets will produce the same sum. Therefore, the number of unique sums would be less than 63. However, the problem says &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;, which must mean that all subset sums are unique. Therefore, maybe the two 3s are actually different numbers in the sense that they are different elements but with the same value, but when combined in subsets, the sums don&#39;t produce duplicates. Wait, but 3 is present twice, so taking one 3 or the other 3 would result in the same sum. So that would produce duplicate sums, hence reducing the total number of unique sums. But the problem says 63. Therefore, this suggests that all subset sums are unique. Therefore, perhaps the two 3s are not actually both 3. Maybe it&#39;s a typo? Wait, the original problem is in Chinese, perhaps the translation is off. Wait, no, the user provided the numbers as 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So two 3s. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is not considering the individual numbers as part of the &quot;new numbers&quot;, but only the sums. Wait, the problem says &quot;Each time, you can either take one of them, or take several different numbers to find their sum&quot;. So taking one of them is allowed, which would just be the number itself. Therefore, the numbers themselves are included in the 63 new numbers. Therefore, if two subsets result in the same sum, they are considered the same number. Therefore, even though there are 63 subsets, the number of unique sums is less. But the problem says &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;. Therefore, this is contradictory. Therefore, perhaps in the problem statement, the two 3s are actually different numbers. Wait, but how? Unless they are different numbers that just happen to have the same value. For example, if they are two distinct elements both with value 3. But in that case, when you take either of them, you get 3, but taking both gives 6. So the possible sums would include 3 (from either single 3), 6 (from both 3s), and other combinations. So if we count each sum only once, even if obtained from different subsets, then the total number of unique sums would be less than 63. However, the problem states 63, so maybe in this case, all subset sums are unique. But that&#39;s impossible, because taking either 3 alone gives the same sum. Therefore, there must be duplicates. Therefore, the problem statement must have a mistake, or perhaps the original numbers are different. Wait, maybe the two 3s are actually 3 and another number? Maybe a translation error. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are 1, 3, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4, 3^5, which would be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. But in the problem statement, it&#39;s written as 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So perhaps it&#39;s a typo, and the second 3 should be 9. Then the numbers would be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, which are all powers of 3. Then, the subset sums would be unique, and the total number is 63. However, the problem as stated includes two 3s. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts the two 3s as separate numbers, so even if they produce the same sum when taken individually, they are considered different. But that wouldn&#39;t make sense, because when arranging in ascending order, duplicates would be removed. The problem says &quot;they are arranged in ascending order, they are 1, 3, 4, 9, ...&quot;, so the list is strictly increasing. Therefore, duplicates must have been removed, and the problem counts unique sums. Therefore, the total number of unique sums is 63. Therefore, even with two 3s, all subset sums are unique. Wait, that&#39;s only possible if the two 3s can&#39;t be distinguished in the sums, but if they can be combined. Let&#39;s test this.Let me try to list some subset sums:First, the single numbers: 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. So in the unique sorted list, these would be 1, 3, 27, 81, 243. But the two 3s are duplicates. So that&#39;s 5 numbers. Then, sums of two numbers:1+3=4 (from first 3), 1+3=4 (from second 3), 1+27=28, 1+81=82, 1+243=244, 3+3=6, 3+27=30, 3+81=84, 3+243=246, 3+27=30 (from the second 3), 3+81=84 (second 3), 3+243=246 (second 3), 27+81=108, 27+243=270, 81+243=324.So here, the sums of two numbers would include duplicates: 4 appears twice, 30, 84, 246 each appear twice. Then 6, 28, 82, 244, 108, 270, 324. So unique sums here are 4, 6, 28, 30, 82, 84, 108, 244, 246, 270, 324. So 11 unique sums. Then, adding this to the single numbers: 1, 3, 27, 81, 243. Then, the two-element sums add 11 numbers. So total so far: 5 + 11 = 16.Then three-element sums. Let&#39;s see:1+3+3=7, 1+3+27=31, 1+3+81=85, 1+3+243=247, 1+3+27=31 (second 3), 1+3+81=85 (second 3), 1+3+243=247 (second 3), 1+27+81=109, 1+27+243=271, 1+81+243=325, 3+3+27=33, 3+3+81=87, 3+3+243=249, 3+27+81=111, 3+27+243=273, 3+81+243=327, 27+81+243=351.But again, duplicates here. For example, 31, 85, 247 each appear twice. So unique sums from three elements would be 7, 31, 33, 85, 87, 109, 111, 247, 249, 271, 273, 325, 327, 351. That&#39;s 14 unique sums. Adding to previous total: 16 + 14 = 30.Four-element sums:1+3+3+27=34, 1+3+3+81=88, 1+3+3+243=250, 1+3+27+81=112, 1+3+27+243=272, 1+3+81+243=328, 1+3+27+81=112 (second 3), 1+3+27+243=272 (second 3), 1+3+81+243=328 (second 3), 1+27+81+243=352, 3+3+27+81=114, 3+3+27+243=276, 3+3+81+243=330, 3+27+81+243=354, 27+81+243=351 (but already counted in three-element sums). Wait, 351 is already counted, so duplicates here. Let&#39;s see:Unique four-element sums: 34, 88, 250, 112, 272, 328, 352, 114, 276, 330, 354. That&#39;s 11 unique sums. Adding to total: 30 + 11 = 41.Five-element sums:1+3+3+27+81=115, 1+3+3+27+243=277, 1+3+3+81+243=331, 1+3+27+81+243=355, 1+3+27+81+243=355 (second 3), 3+3+27+81+243=357.So unique sums: 115, 277, 331, 355, 357. That&#39;s 5 unique sums. Total now: 41 + 5 = 46.Six-element sum:1+3+3+27+81+243=358. So one unique sum. Total: 46 + 1 = 47.Wait, but the problem says a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained. But according to my count here, even with duplicates removed, there are only 47 unique sums. That&#39;s a problem. Therefore, either my counting is wrong, or there&#39;s a misunderstanding in the problem statement.Wait, perhaps the two 3s are actually allowed to be used multiple times? But the problem says &quot;each number can only be taken once&quot;. If the two 3s are separate numbers, then using both is allowed. Wait, but when you take subsets, you can take each element at most once. So with two 3s, you can take 0, 1, or 2 of them. Therefore, the total number of subsets is 2^2 (for the 3s) * 2^4 (for the other numbers) = 4 * 16 = 64 subsets. So 63 non-empty subsets. Therefore, the total number of subset sums is 63, but with duplicates. However, the problem states &quot;a total of 63 new numbers can be obtained&quot;, which must mean that all subset sums are unique. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the two 3s are actually different numbers? Maybe in Chinese, the numbers are written differently? For example, one is 3 and the other is three, but they are different characters. But in the problem, they are both given as 3. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, and one of the 3s should be a 9. If that&#39;s the case, then the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, which are all distinct and each is 3^n. Then, the subset sums would all be unique, as each number is a different power of 3, so their sums would be unique due to the uniqueness of base-3 representations. In that case, the total number of non-empty subsets is 63, and each sum is unique, so the sorted list would have 63 elements. Then, the 58th number would be the 6th largest number, since in ascending order, the 63rd number is the sum of all numbers, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = let&#39;s calculate that: 1+3=4, 4+9=13, 13+27=40, 40+81=121, 121+243=364. So the largest number is 364. Then the 63rd number is 364. The 62nd would be 364 -1 = 363, but wait, that&#39;s not how it works. If all subset sums are unique, the numbers are arranged in ascending order, so the 58th number would be 364 minus the sum of the 5 smallest numbers. Wait, but maybe another approach.Alternatively, if the numbers are distinct and each is a power of 3, then each subset corresponds to a unique number in base 3, where each digit is 0 or 1. Therefore, the subset sums correspond to numbers from 1 to 3^6 - 1 in base 3, which are all unique. Therefore, the numbers would be 1, 3, 4 (1+3), 9, 10 (1+9), 12 (3+9), 13 (1+3+9), 27, etc. So in ascending order, each subsequent number is obtained by including the next higher power of 3. However, in this case, the numbers are 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, ..., up to 364.But in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that the numbers start as 1, 3, 4, 9, ..., which matches the beginning of this sequence. Therefore, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the numbers are actually 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 instead of two 3s. That would make sense because with powers of 3, all subset sums are unique, and there are 63 unique sums. Therefore, maybe the problem statement in Chinese had a misprint, and the second 3 is supposed to be a 9. If that&#39;s the case, then the problem becomes manageable.Assuming that the numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, each being a power of 3. Then, the subset sums correspond to numbers with base-3 digits 0 or 1. Therefore, each subset sum is a unique number, and their ascending order is straightforward. Each number can be represented as a combination of these powers of 3. Since each power of 3 is larger than the sum of all previous ones, each new power added will create new numbers that are larger than all previous sums.In this case, the numbers in ascending order would start as follows:1, 3, 1+3=4, 9, 1+9=10, 3+9=12, 1+3+9=13, 27, 1+27=28, 3+27=30, 1+3+27=31, 9+27=36, 1+9+27=37, 3+9+27=39, 1+3+9+27=40, 81, and so on.Following this pattern, each time a higher power of 3 is introduced, it&#39;s followed by all combinations with the lower powers. Since each new power is more than double the previous total sum, the numbers are ordered by the highest power included.Therefore, the numbers can be grouped by the highest power of 3 they contain:- Up to 3^0 (1): just 1.- Up to 3^1 (3): 1, 3, 4 (1+3).- Up to 3^2 (9): previous sums plus 9, 10 (1+9), 12 (3+9), 13 (1+3+9).- Up to 3^3 (27): previous sums plus 27, 28 (1+27), 30 (3+27), 31 (1+3+27), 36 (9+27), 37 (1+9+27), 39 (3+9+27), 40 (1+3+9+27).- Up to 3^4 (81): similarly, adding 81 to all previous sums.- Up to 3^5 (243): adding 243 to all previous sums.Since each new power of 3 is larger than the sum of all previous ones, the order will be all sums without the new power, followed by all sums with the new power. Therefore, the numbers can be partitioned into blocks:1. 1 (1 number)2. 3, 4 (2 numbers)3. 9, 10, 12, 13 (4 numbers)4. 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40 (8 numbers)5. 81, 82, 84, 85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 108, 109, 111, 112, 117, 118, 120, 121 (16 numbers)6. 243 + previous sums (32 numbers)Wait, each time we add a new power of 3, the number of new sums doubles. So for each power 3^k, the number of new sums is 2^k. Wait:- 3^0: 1 sum (1)- 3^1: 2 sums (3, 1+3=4)- 3^2: 4 sums (9, 1+9=10, 3+9=12, 1+3+9=13)- 3^3: 8 sums- 3^4: 16 sums- 3^5: 32 sumsTotal sums: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63. That matches the problem statement. Therefore, if the original numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, then the total unique subset sums are 63, arranged as above.In this case, the 58th number would be in the last block (the 243 block), since the first five blocks sum to 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 numbers. Then, the 243 block has 32 numbers, so numbers 32 to 63 (since 31 + 32 = 63). Therefore, the 58th number is the (58 - 31) = 27th number in the 243 block. But wait, the 243 block is constructed by adding 243 to each of the previous 32 sums (from the first five blocks). Since the previous sums are ordered ascendingly, adding 243 to each will also be ordered ascendingly. Therefore, the 243 block starts at 1+243=244, 3+243=246, 4+243=247, 9+243=252, 10+243=253, 12+243=255, 13+243=256, 27+243=270, ..., up to the sum of all numbers: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364.But the order within the 243 block is determined by the previous sums. Since each previous block is ordered, adding 243 to each will preserve the order. Therefore, the 243 block is ordered as:244 (1+243),246 (3+243),247 (4+243),252 (9+243),253 (10+243),255 (12+243),256 (13+243),270 (27+243),271 (28+243),273 (30+243),274 (31+243),279 (36+243),280 (37+243),282 (39+243),283 (40+243),324 (81+243),325 (82+243),327 (84+243),328 (85+243),333 (90+243),334 (91+243),336 (93+243),337 (94+243),351 (108+243),352 (109+243),354 (111+243),355 (112+243),360 (117+243),361 (118+243),363 (120+243),364 (121+243),364+... Wait, but the sum of all previous numbers plus 243 is 1+3+9+27+81+243=364. So there are 32 numbers in the 243 block, each being 243 + sum of a non-empty subset of the lower powers. Since the first five blocks have 31 numbers, the 243 block is numbers 32 to 63.Therefore, the 243 block starts at position 32: 244, 246, 247, 252, 253, 255, 256, 270, 271, 273, 274, 279, 280, 282, 283, 324, 325, 327, 328, 333, 334, 336, 337, 351, 352, 354, 355, 360, 361, 363, 364. Wait, but 32 numbers. Let me count:Starting from 244:1. 2442. 2463. 2474. 2525. 2536. 2557. 2568. 2709. 27110. 27311. 27412. 27913. 28014. 28215. 28316. 32417. 32518. 32719. 32820. 33321. 33422. 33623. 33724. 35125. 35226. 35427. 35528. 36029. 36130. 36331. 36432. ?Wait, hold on. If the previous blocks have 31 numbers, then the 243 block should have 32 numbers. But when I list them out, I only get 31 numbers. Wait, perhaps I missed one.Wait, let&#39;s recount:From the first five blocks (sums without 243):1 (1),3, 4 (2),9, 10, 12, 13 (4),27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40 (8),81, 82, 84, 85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 108, 109, 111, 112, 117, 118, 120, 121 (16).Total: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31. Then, adding 243 to each of these 31 subsets (excluding the empty set) gives 31 numbers. But the 243 block should have 32 numbers. Wait, no. The total number of non-empty subsets is 63. The first 31 numbers are the sums without 243, and the next 32 numbers are the sums with 243. Wait, but if we consider that including 243, the number of subsets that include 243 is 32, because the other five numbers (1, 3, 9, 27, 81) have 2^5 = 32 subsets (including the empty set). Therefore, the sums that include 243 are 243 + sum(S), where S is a subset of {1, 3, 9, 27, 81}. Since S can be empty, which would give 243, but the problem states that all subsets are non-empty. Wait, but 243 itself is a subset (just {243}), so if we consider all subsets that include 243, they are equivalent to 243 + subsets of the remaining numbers (including the empty subset). However, since the total subsets are non-empty, the subsets that include 243 can be either {243} alone (which is 243) or 243 plus a non-empty subset of the remaining numbers. Therefore, the number of subsets including 243 is 1 + 31 = 32. But in the problem statement, the original numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243. So {243} is a valid subset, sum is 243, which would be included. However, in our previous count, the first five blocks (without 243) have 31 numbers. Then, the 243 block (including 243 and 243 plus subsets of the first five numbers) would be 32 numbers. Therefore, 31 + 32 = 63, which matches.Therefore, the 243 block includes:- 243 (just {243}),- 243 + 1 = 244,- 243 + 3 = 246,- 243 + 1 + 3 = 247,- 243 + 9 = 252,- 243 + 1 + 9 = 253,- 243 + 3 + 9 = 255,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 256,- 243 + 27 = 270,- 243 + 1 + 27 = 271,- 243 + 3 + 27 = 273,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 27 = 274,- 243 + 9 + 27 = 279,- 243 + 1 + 9 + 27 = 280,- 243 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 282,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 283,- 243 + 81 = 324,- 243 + 1 + 81 = 325,- 243 + 3 + 81 = 327,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 81 = 328,- 243 + 9 + 81 = 333,- 243 + 1 + 9 + 81 = 334,- 243 + 3 + 9 + 81 = 336,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 81 = 337,- 243 + 27 + 81 = 351,- 243 + 1 + 27 + 81 = 352,- 243 + 3 + 27 + 81 = 354,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 27 + 81 = 355,- 243 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 360,- 243 + 1 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 361,- 243 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 363,- 243 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 364.Therefore, the 243 block has 32 numbers, starting from 243 (position 32) up to 364 (position 63). Therefore, the numbers in the 243 block are:32. 24333. 24434. 24635. 24736. 25237. 25338. 25539. 25640. 27041. 27142. 27343. 27444. 27945. 28046. 28247. 28348. 32449. 32550. 32751. 32852. 33353. 33454. 33655. 33756. 35157. 35258. 35459. 35560. 36061. 36162. 36363. 364Therefore, the 58th number is 354. Therefore, if the original numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, then the 58th number is 354.But the original problem states the numbers as 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243. Therefore, there&#39;s a discrepancy. If there are two 3s instead of a 9, the entire structure breaks down, as we saw earlier, leading to duplicate sums and fewer unique numbers. However, since the problem mentions 63 numbers, which matches the unique subset sums of six distinct numbers (each a power of 3), it&#39;s likely that there was a typo in the problem statement, and the second 3 should be a 9. Given that the user has presented the problem as is, with two 3s, but the answer expected is based on the powers of 3, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that it&#39;s a typo, and the second 3 is 9.Alternatively, if the two 3s are indeed correct, then the problem&#39;s assertion of 63 unique numbers is incorrect, which complicates things. But given that the problem statement includes the sequence starting with 1, 3, 4, 9, ..., which matches the powers of 3 subset sums, it&#39;s more plausible that the intended numbers are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, with all subset sums unique. Therefore, under this assumption, the 58th number is 354.Alternatively, to verify, let&#39;s see the progression:First block (1): 1 (1 number)Second block (3): 3, 4 (2 numbers)Third block (9): 9, 10, 12, 13 (4 numbers)Fourth block (27): 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40 (8 numbers)Fifth block (81): 81, 82, 84, 85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 108, 109, 111, 112, 117, 118, 120, 121 (16 numbers)Sixth block (243): 243, 244, 246, 247, 252, 253, 255, 256, 270, 271, 273, 274, 279, 280, 282, 283, 324, 325, 327, 328, 333, 334, 336, 337, 351, 352, 354, 355, 360, 361, 363, 364 (32 numbers)Therefore, the positions are:1: 12: 33: 44: 95: 106: 127: 138: 279: 2810: 3011: 3112: 3613: 3714: 3915: 4016: 8117: 8218: 8419: 8520: 9021: 9122: 9323: 9424: 10825: 10926: 11127: 11228: 11729: 11830: 12031: 12132: 24333: 24434: 24635: 24736: 25237: 25338: 25539: 25640: 27041: 27142: 27343: 27444: 27945: 28046: 28247: 28348: 32449: 32550: 32751: 32852: 33353: 33454: 33655: 33756: 35157: 35258: 354So yes, the 58th number is 354. Therefore, even though the problem statement mentions two 3s, likely there was a typo, and the correct numbers are the powers of 3. Hence, the answer is 354.Final Answerboxed{354}&lt;/think&gt;Given the problem of finding the 58th number in the ascending order of sums obtained from the numbers 1, 3, 3, 27, 81, 243, we need to consider the possibility of unique subset sums. However, due to the duplicate 3s, the problem might have a typo, and the correct numbers should be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 (all powers of 3). With these numbers, each subset sum is unique and can be represented in base 3. The numbers are grouped by the highest power of 3 they contain:1. Block 1 (1): 1 (1 number)2. Block 2 (3): 3, 4 (2 numbers)3. Block 3 (9): 9, 10, 12, 13 (4 numbers)4. Block 4 (27): 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40 (8 numbers)5. Block 5 (81): 81, 82, 84, 85, 90, 91, 93, 94, 108, 109, 111, 112, 117, 118, 120, 121 (16 numbers)6. Block 6 (243): 243, 244, 246, 247, 252, 253, 255, 256, 270, 271, 273, 274, 279, 280, 282, 283, 324, 325, 327, 328, 333, 334, 336, 337, 351, 352, 354, 355, 360, 361, 363, 364 (32 numbers)The 58th number falls in the 243 block, which starts at position 32.

It&#39;s given that a_6 = b_8, and then I have to figure out which of the options A to D is necessarily true regarding the relationship between a_3 + a_9 and b_9 + b_7.First, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a common ratio, so a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio. Since the terms are positive, both a_1 and r must be positive. An arithmetic sequence has each term obtained by adding a common difference, so b_n = b_1 + (n-1)d, where b_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.The key information here is that a_6 = b_8. Let me write expressions for these terms. For the geometric sequence: a_6 = a_1 * r^(5). For the arithmetic sequence: b_8 = b_1 + 7d. So, a_1 * r^5 = b_1 + 7d.Now, the question is about comparing a_3 + a_9 and b_9 + b_7. Let&#39;s express each of these in terms of a_1, r, b_1, and d.Starting with the geometric sequence terms:a_3 = a_1 * r^(2)a_9 = a_1 * r^(8)So, a_3 + a_9 = a_1 * r^2 + a_1 * r^8 = a_1 r^2 (1 + r^6)For the arithmetic sequence terms:b_9 = b_1 + 8db_7 = b_1 + 6dSo, b_9 + b_7 = (b_1 + 8d) + (b_1 + 6d) = 2b_1 + 14dWe need to compare a_1 r^2 (1 + r^6) and 2b_1 + 14d.But we know from the given condition that a_1 r^5 = b_1 + 7d. Let me denote that equation as (1): a_1 r^5 = b_1 + 7d.From equation (1), if I multiply both sides by 2, I get 2a_1 r^5 = 2b_1 + 14d. So, 2b_1 + 14d = 2a_1 r^5. Therefore, the sum b_9 + b_7 is equal to 2a_1 r^5.So now, the comparison becomes a_1 r^2 (1 + r^6) vs. 2a_1 r^5.Since all terms are positive (given that the geometric sequence has positive terms), we can divide both sides by a_1 r^2 without changing the inequality direction. So, we need to compare 1 + r^6 vs. 2r^3.So, the inequality in question is: Is 1 + r^6 ≥ 2r^3? Or ≤? Depending on that, we can determine which option is correct.Wait, let&#39;s write it out:We need to check whether a_3 + a_9 ≥ b_9 + b_7. Substituted expressions, this is equivalent to checking whether 1 + r^6 ≥ 2r^3.Similarly, if 1 + r^6 ≤ 2r^3, then the opposite would be true.But let&#39;s analyze the expression 1 + r^6 - 2r^3. Let&#39;s set x = r^3, so the expression becomes 1 + x^2 - 2x, which is x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2.Since (x - 1)^2 is always non-negative for real x, and since r is positive (because the geometric sequence has positive terms), x = r^3 is positive. Therefore, (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all positive x. Hence, 1 + r^6 - 2r^3 ≥ 0, which implies 1 + r^6 ≥ 2r^3. Therefore, a_3 + a_9 ≥ b_9 + b_7.But equality occurs when (x - 1)^2 = 0, i.e., x = 1, so r^3 = 1, which implies r = 1. If r = 1, then the geometric sequence is constant: all terms are equal to a_1. Then, from equation (1), a_1 = b_1 + 7d. But in that case, the arithmetic sequence would have terms that can be written as b_n = b_1 + (n - 1)d, so b_8 = b_1 + 7d = a_1. If r = 1, then all a_n = a_1, so a_3 + a_9 = a_1 + a_1 = 2a_1, and b_9 + b_7 = (b_1 + 8d) + (b_1 + 6d) = 2b_1 + 14d. But since a_1 = b_1 + 7d, substituting gives 2(b_1 + 7d) = 2a_1. Therefore, equality holds when r = 1.Therefore, in general, a_3 + a_9 ≥ b_9 + b_7, with equality if and only if r = 1. Therefore, the correct answer is B: a_3 + a_9 ≥ b_9 + b_7.Let me double-check to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes in substitutions or algebra.Starting from:a_3 + a_9 = a_1 r^2 + a_1 r^8 = a_1 r^2 (1 + r^6)b_9 + b_7 = 2b_1 + 14d = 2(b_1 + 7d) = 2a_1 r^5 (from equation (1))So comparing a_1 r^2 (1 + r^6) and 2a_1 r^5. Dividing both sides by a_1 r^2 (which is positive), gives 1 + r^6 vs. 2r^3. As I did before, set x = r^3, so 1 + x^2 vs. 2x. Then, 1 + x^2 - 2x = (x - 1)^2 ≥ 0. Hence, 1 + x^2 ≥ 2x, so 1 + r^6 ≥ 2r^3. Therefore, the inequality holds, so a_3 + a_9 ≥ b_9 + b_7. Therefore, option B is correct.Therefore, the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the sequence ({a_n}) is a geometric sequence with positive terms, and ({b_n}) is an arithmetic sequence, and (a_6 = b_8), we need to determine the relationship between (a_3 + a_9) and (b_9 + b_7).First, express the terms of the sequences:- For the geometric sequence: (a_6 = a_1 cdot r^5)- For the arithmetic sequence: (b_8 = b_1 + 7d)Given (a_6 = b_8), we have:[ a_1 cdot r^5 = b_1 + 7d ]Next, express (a_3 + a_9) and (b_9 + b_7):- For the geometric sequence:  [  a_3 = a_1 cdot r^2 quad text{and} quad a_9 = a_1 cdot r^8  ]  [  a_3 + a_9 = a_1 cdot r^2 + a_1 cdot r^8 = a_1 cdot r^2 (1 + r^6)  ]- For the arithmetic sequence:  [  b_9 = b_1 + 8d quad text{and} quad b_7 = b_1 + 6d  ]  [  b_9 + b_7 = (b_1 + 8d) + (b_1 + 6d) = 2b_1 + 14d  ]Using the given condition (a_1 cdot r^5 = b_1 + 7d), we can substitute (2b_1 + 14d) as:[ 2(b_1 + 7d) = 2a_1 cdot r^5 ]Thus, we need to compare:[ a_1 cdot r^2 (1 + r^6) quad text{and} quad 2a_1 cdot r^5 ]Dividing both sides by (a_1 cdot r^2) (positive terms):[ 1 + r^6 quad text{vs} quad 2r^3 ]Let (x = r^3). Then the inequality becomes:[ 1 + x^2 geq 2x ][ x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2 geq 0 ]Since ((x - 1)^2 geq 0) is always true, equality holds when (x = 1), i.e., (r = 1). Therefore, (1 + r^6 geq 2r^3), implying (a_3 + a_9 geq b_9 + b_7).Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{B}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a geometric sequence {a_n} with positive terms and an arithmetic sequence {b_n}. We know that a₆ = b₈. The question is asking which of the options A to D must be true regarding the relationship between a₃ + a₉ and b₉ + b₇. First, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). So, for the geometric sequence {a_n}, the nth term can be written as a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1), where a₁ is the first term and r is the common ratio. Since the terms are positive, both a₁ and r must be positive.In an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference (d) to the previous term. So, for the arithmetic sequence {b_n}, the nth term is b_n = b₁ + (n-1)*d, where b₁ is the first term and d is the common difference.Given that a₆ = b₈, let&#39;s write down those terms:For the geometric sequence:a₆ = a₁ * r^(6-1) = a₁ * r^5For the arithmetic sequence:b₈ = b₁ + (8-1)*d = b₁ + 7dSo, we have a₁ * r^5 = b₁ + 7d. Let&#39;s note this equation as equation (1).Now, we need to compare a₃ + a₉ with b₉ + b₇.Let&#39;s compute each term:First, for the geometric sequence {a_n}:a₃ = a₁ * r^(3-1) = a₁ * r²a₉ = a₁ * r^(9-1) = a₁ * r⁸So, a₃ + a₉ = a₁ * r² + a₁ * r⁸ = a₁ r² (1 + r⁶)For the arithmetic sequence {b_n}:b₉ = b₁ + (9-1)*d = b₁ + 8db₇ = b₁ + (7-1)*d = b₁ + 6dTherefore, b₉ + b₇ = (b₁ + 8d) + (b₁ + 6d) = 2b₁ + 14dSo, we need to compare a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) with 2b₁ + 14d.From equation (1), we know that a₁ r^5 = b₁ + 7d. Let&#39;s denote that term as something, say, let&#39;s set k = a₁ r^5 = b₁ + 7d. Then, 2b₁ + 14d = 2(b₁ + 7d) = 2k.So, the comparison becomes: a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) versus 2k, where k = a₁ r^5. Therefore, substituting k into the right side, we have 2k = 2a₁ r^5. So now, we need to compare a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) and 2a₁ r^5. Since all terms are positive (given that {a_n} has positive terms and r is positive), we can divide both sides by a₁ r² without changing the inequality direction. So, dividing both sides by a₁ r² gives:1 + r⁶ vs 2r³Therefore, the inequality reduces to whether 1 + r⁶ ≥ 2r³ or 1 + r⁶ ≤ 2r³.Wait, actually, 2a₁ r^5 divided by a₁ r² is 2r³. So, the comparison becomes:1 + r⁶ ≥ 2r³?Let me write that:Compare 1 + r⁶ and 2r³.Hmm. Let&#39;s consider the function f(r) = 1 + r⁶ - 2r³. We need to determine the sign of f(r) for r &gt; 0.Notice that r⁶ - 2r³ + 1 is a quadratic in terms of r³. Let&#39;s substitute y = r³. Then the expression becomes y² - 2y + 1 = (y - 1)^2. Which is always non-negative for all real y. Since r &gt; 0, y = r³ &gt; 0, so (y - 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all y &gt; 0. Therefore, 1 + r⁶ - 2r³ = (r³ - 1)^2 ≥ 0. Therefore, 1 + r⁶ ≥ 2r³ for all real numbers r, with equality if and only if r³ = 1, i.e., r = 1.So, this means that a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) ≥ 2a₁ r^5, which implies that a₃ + a₉ ≥ 2k = 2(b₁ + 7d) = b₉ + b₇. Wait, but hold on, from earlier steps, 2k = 2a₁ r^5 = 2*(b₁ +7d) = 2b₁ +14d = b₉ + b₇.So, we have a₃ + a₉ = a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) ≥ 2a₁ r^5 = 2k = b₉ + b₇. Therefore, a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₉ + b₇, with equality if and only if r = 1.But in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence with positive terms. There&#39;s no restriction on r, except r &gt; 0. So, unless r = 1, the inequality is strict. However, if r =1, then the geometric sequence becomes a constant sequence where aₙ = a₁ for all n. Similarly, the arithmetic sequence would have to have b₈ = a₁. Then, b₇ = a₁ - d and b₉ = a₁ + d, so b₇ + b₉ = 2a₁. On the other hand, a₃ + a₉ = a₁ + a₁ = 2a₁. So, in that case, equality holds. But since the problem states that {a_n} is a geometric sequence with positive terms. It doesn&#39;t specify that r ≠ 1. So, in general, it&#39;s possible that a₃ + a₉ = b₉ + b₇ if r =1, but otherwise, a₃ + a₉ &gt; b₉ + b₇.Looking at the answer choices:A: a₃ + a₉ ≤ b₉ + b₇B: a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₉ + b₇C: a₃ + a₉ &gt; b₉ + b₇D: a₃ + a₉  ^ b₉ + b₇ (assuming this is a typo, maybe supposed to be &#39;=&#39; or something else. But in the original problem statement, D is written as &quot;a_{3}+a_{9} ,^ b_{9}+b_{7}&quot; which might be a formatting error. Maybe in the original it&#39;s supposed to be &#39;≠&#39; or another symbol. But given the options, perhaps in the original it&#39;s a less common symbol, but since in the user&#39;s message it&#39;s written as ,^ maybe a caret? Not sure. However, given the options A to D, and the possible answers, likely C and B are the main contenders. But in the problem statement, the options are as given.But according to our analysis, a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₉ + b₇ is always true, with equality when r =1. Since the problem says &quot;it must be true that...&quot;, and since B says &quot;≥&quot;, which is always true regardless of r, whereas C says &quot;&gt;&quot;, which is not true when r=1, because then it&#39;s equal. However, the problem states that {a_n} is a geometric sequence with positive terms. If r=1 is allowed, then B is the correct answer. But is r=1 allowed?In a geometric sequence, the common ratio can be 1, which makes it a constant sequence. So yes, r=1 is allowed unless specified otherwise. Therefore, since in that case a₃ + a₉ = b₉ + b₇, the inequality is not strict. Therefore, the correct answer is B, because it&#39;s always true that a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₉ + b₇, with equality possible.But let&#39;s verify again to ensure there&#39;s no miscalculation.So, starting from:a₃ + a₉ = a₁ r² + a₁ r⁸ = a₁ r² (1 + r⁶)b₇ + b₉ = 2b₁ +14d = 2(b₁ +7d) = 2a₁ r^5 (since from equation (1): a₁ r^5 = b₁ +7d)Therefore, we have:a₃ + a₉ = a₁ r² (1 + r⁶)b₇ + b₉ = 2a₁ r^5Therefore, comparing a₁ r² (1 + r⁶) and 2a₁ r^5.Divide both sides by a₁ r² (since a₁ &gt;0 and r &gt;0, so division is allowed without changing inequality direction):1 + r⁶ vs 2r³As before, 1 + r⁶ - 2r³ = (r³ -1)^2 ≥0Therefore, 1 + r⁶ ≥ 2r³, so a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₇ + b₉.Equality holds when (r³ -1)^2 =0 =&gt; r³ =1 =&gt; r=1.Since r can be 1, so equality is possible, hence the correct answer is B: a₃ + a₉ ≥ b₉ + b₇.But let me check the answer options again. The user provided options:A: ≤B: ≥C: &gt;D: ,^ (unknown, perhaps a typo)But assuming that D is invalid or a typo, then between A, B, C. Since B is the correct one because it includes the equality case when r=1, and the problem states &quot;it must be true&quot;, so even if sometimes it&#39;s equal and sometimes greater, the &quot;must be true&quot; is the one that&#39;s always true. Since C is &quot;&gt;&quot;, which is not true when r=1, so C is not always true. Therefore, B is the answer.But just to ensure, let&#39;s take an example.Example 1: Let r=1. Then, the geometric sequence is constant: a_n = a₁ for all n. Then, a₆ = a₁. Then, since a₆ = b₈, so b₈ = a₁. The arithmetic sequence has b₈ = b₁ +7d =a₁. Therefore, b₁ = a₁ -7d. Then, compute b₇ + b₉:b₇ = b₁ +6d = (a₁ -7d) +6d =a₁ -db₉ = b₁ +8d = (a₁ -7d) +8d =a₁ +dThus, b₇ +b₉ = (a₁ -d) + (a₁ +d) =2a₁Meanwhile, a₃ +a₉ =a₁ +a₁ =2a₁. So equality holds. So, B is valid here.Example 2: Let r=2, which is greater than 1. Let&#39;s set a₁ such that a₆ =b₈.Compute a₆ =a₁ *2^5=32a₁.Set b₈ =32a₁. The arithmetic sequence has b₈ =b₁ +7d=32a₁. Let&#39;s choose a specific value for a₁. Let’s say a₁=1 for simplicity.Then, b₁ +7d=32.Let’s choose b₁=32 -7d. Let’s choose d=1 for simplicity. Then, b₁=32 -7=25.So, the arithmetic sequence is b_n=25 + (n-1)*1=24 +n.Compute b₇ +b₉: b₇=24+7=31; b₉=24 +9=33. So, sum is 31+33=64.Compute a₃ +a₉: a₃=1*2^(2)=4; a₉=1*2^8=256. Sum=4+256=260. Compare to 64. 260 &gt;64. So, here, C would be correct. But since when r=1, we have equality, so C is not always true, but B is.Example 3: Let r=1/2, which is less than 1. Then, a₆ =a₁*(1/2)^5= a₁/32. Let a₁=32, so a₆=1. Then, set b₈=1. Let the arithmetic sequence be b_n =b₁ + (n-1)d. Then, b₈ =b₁ +7d=1.Let’s choose b₁=1 -7d. Let&#39;s pick d=1/7. Then, b₁=1 -7*(1/7)=0. Therefore, b_n=0 + (n-1)*(1/7)=(n-1)/7.Compute b₇ +b₉: b₇=(7-1)/7=6/7; b₉=(9-1)/7=8/7. Sum=14/7=2.Compute a₃ +a₉: a₃=32*(1/2)^2=32*(1/4)=8; a₉=32*(1/2)^8=32*(1/256)=1/8. So, sum=8 +1/8=8.125. Compare to 2. 8.125 &gt;2. So again, a₃ +a₉ &gt;b₇ +b₉. But in the case r=1, it&#39;s equal. So, again, B is the correct answer since it&#39;s always ≥, but sometimes &gt;.Wait, but in these examples, even when r &lt;1 or r&gt;1, the sum a₃ +a₉ is greater than b₇ +b₉. But when r=1, it&#39;s equal. Therefore, the inequality is always ≥, but never ≤. Therefore, A is never true, B is always true, C is almost always true except when r=1. But the problem states &quot;it must be true that&quot;. So, since in some cases it&#39;s equal, and in others it&#39;s greater, but never less, the correct answer is B. The answer C would not hold when r=1, so it&#39;s not always true. Therefore, B is the correct choice.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the sequence ({a_n}) is a geometric sequence with positive terms, and ({b_n}) is an arithmetic sequence, and (a_6 = b_8), we need to determine the relationship between (a_3 + a_9) and (b_9 + b_7).1. Geometric Sequence Terms:   - (a_6 = a_1 cdot r^5)   - (a_3 = a_1 cdot r^2)   - (a_9 = a_1 cdot r^8)   - Sum: (a_3 + a_9 = a_1 cdot r^2 + a_1 cdot r^8 = a_1 cdot r^2 (1 + r^6))2. Arithmetic Sequence Terms:   - (b_8 = b_1 + 7d)   - (b_9 = b_1 + 8d)   - (b_7 = b_1 + 6d)   - Sum: (b_9 + b_7 = (b_1 + 8d) + (b_1 + 6d) = 2b_1 + 14d)3. Given Condition:   - (a_6 = b_8 implies a_1 cdot r^5 = b_1 + 7d)4. Comparison:   - Substitute (k = a_1 cdot r^5 = b_1 + 7d) into the arithmetic sequence sum: (2b_1 + 14d = 2k)   - Compare (a_1 cdot r^2 (1 + r^6)) and (2a_1 cdot r^5)   - Simplify by dividing both sides by (a_1 cdot r^2): (1 + r^6) vs (2r^3)5. Inequality Analysis:   - The expression (1 + r^6 - 2r^3) can be rewritten as ((r^3 - 1)^2), which is always non-negative.   - Therefore, (1 + r^6 geq 2r^3) for all positive (r), with equality if and only if (r = 1).6. Conclusion:   - Since (a_3 + a_9 geq b_9 + b_7) holds for all positive (r) (with equality when (r = 1)), the correct answer is (boxed{B}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-618a4ba7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-618a4ba7><span class="icon" data-v-618a4ba7>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis question examines the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences and the application of basic inequalities.

The options are given as A to D. Let me start by recalling some basics about polar coordinates and how to represent lines in them.First, in polar coordinates, a point is represented as (ρ, θ), where ρ is the distance from the origin (or pole) and θ is the angle measured from the polar axis (which is the positive x-axis in Cartesian coordinates). The point (1, π) would then be located 1 unit away from the origin at an angle of π radians, which is 180 degrees. So, in Cartesian coordinates, that would be (ρ cos θ, ρ sin θ) = (1*cos π, 1*sin π) = (-1, 0). So, point P is at (-1, 0) in Cartesian coordinates.Now, the problem says the line we need is perpendicular to the polar axis. The polar axis is the positive x-axis, so a line perpendicular to it would be a vertical line in Cartesian coordinates. A vertical line in Cartesian coordinates has the equation x = constant. Since the line passes through point P at (-1, 0), the equation of the vertical line would be x = -1.So, if I can convert the Cartesian equation x = -1 into polar coordinates, that should give me the correct answer. Let&#39;s recall the conversion formulas between Cartesian and polar coordinates:x = ρ cos θy = ρ sin θSo, substituting x = -1 into polar coordinates gives:ρ cos θ = -1Solving for ρ, we get:ρ = -1 / cos θHmm, that&#39;s option C: ρ = -1 / cos θ.But let me check the other options to be sure. Option A is ρ = 1, which in polar coordinates is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. That&#39;s not a vertical line, so A is out. Option B is ρ = cos θ. That&#39;s a standard polar equation for a circle as well, but shifted. Specifically, ρ = cos θ is a circle with diameter along the polar axis (x-axis) from (0,0) to (1,0). So that would be a circle tangent to the origin, but passing through (1,0). But we need a vertical line, so B is not right. Option D is ρ = 1 / cos θ. Let me think about that. If we rearrange ρ = 1 / cos θ, then multiplying both sides by cos θ gives ρ cos θ = 1, which in Cartesian is x = 1. That&#39;s a vertical line through (1,0), but our point P is at (-1,0), so x = -1. Therefore, D is x=1, which is not the line we want, whereas C is x=-1. So C is the correct equation.Wait a minute, but let me make sure that when we derived ρ = -1 / cos θ, that&#39;s equivalent to x = -1. Let me verify. Starting with ρ = -1 / cos θ, multiply both sides by cos θ:ρ cos θ = -1But ρ cos θ is x, so x = -1. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So in Cartesian, x = -1, which is a vertical line through (-1,0), which is point P, and perpendicular to the polar axis. Therefore, option C is correct.But hold on, sometimes polar equations can have different representations. Let me think if there&#39;s another way to write x = -1. For example, if we use ρ = -1 / cos θ, that&#39;s valid as long as cos θ ≠ 0. However, in polar coordinates, ρ is typically non-negative, so when we get ρ = -1 / cos θ, we have to consider if ρ can be negative. But in standard polar coordinates, ρ is allowed to be negative, which effectively adds π to the angle. So ρ = -1 / cos θ can also be written as ρ = 1 / cos(θ + π), but that might complicate things. However, the key point is that x = -1 in Cartesian coordinates translates directly to ρ cos θ = -1, which is equivalent to ρ = -1 / cos θ.Alternatively, if we consider the general equation of a line in polar coordinates. There&#39;s a formula for a line that is a certain distance from the pole and at a specific angle. The general equation for a line in polar coordinates is ρ = e / (cos(θ - α)), where e is the distance from the pole to the line, and α is the angle that the line makes with the polar axis. Wait, but our line is vertical, so that would correspond to α = π/2, but maybe that&#39;s not the right way. Let me recall.Alternatively, a vertical line in Cartesian coordinates x = a can be written in polar coordinates as ρ cos θ = a, so ρ = a / cos θ. Similarly, a horizontal line y = b would be ρ sin θ = b, so ρ = b / sin θ. Therefore, for x = -1, which is a vertical line, the equation is ρ cos θ = -1, so ρ = -1 / cos θ, which is exactly option C. Therefore, that&#39;s the answer.But just to make sure, let&#39;s check why option D is tempting. If someone forgets that the line is x = -1 and not x = 1, they might think that since the point is (1, π), which is (-1, 0), but perhaps confusing ρ with the x-coordinate. But ρ is the distance, so ρ is always positive. However, θ is π, so cos θ is -1, hence x = ρ cos θ = 1*(-1) = -1. So, yes, the line is x = -1. So converting back to polar coordinates, we get ρ cos θ = -1 =&gt; ρ = -1 / cos θ. Since ρ can be negative, but in polar coordinates, if ρ is negative, it&#39;s equivalent to adding π to the angle and making ρ positive. So, ρ = -1 / cos θ can also be represented as ρ = 1 / cos(θ + π), but that&#39;s not one of the options. The options have ρ = -1 / cos θ, which is acceptable because negative radii are allowed. So, that&#39;s valid. Therefore, the answer should be C.Therefore, the answer is C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the polar coordinates of point ( P ) are ((1, pi)), we need to find the equation of the line passing through point ( P ) and perpendicular to the polar axis.1. Convert Polar Coordinates to Cartesian Coordinates:   - The point ( P ) in polar coordinates ((1, pi)) converts to Cartesian coordinates ((-1, 0)) because:     [     x = rho cos theta = 1 cdot cos pi = -1     ]     [     y = rho sin theta = 1 cdot sin pi = 0     ]2. Determine the Equation of the Line:   - A line perpendicular to the polar axis (positive x-axis) is a vertical line. Since the line passes through ((-1, 0)), its Cartesian equation is ( x = -1 ).3. Convert the Cartesian Equation to Polar Coordinates:   - The vertical line ( x = -1 ) in Cartesian coordinates converts to polar coordinates using ( x = rho cos theta ):     [     rho cos theta = -1     ]     Solving for ( rho ):     [     rho = -frac{1}{cos theta}     ]4. Verify the Options:   - Option C is (rho = -frac{1}{cos theta}), which matches the derived equation. Other options are incorrect as they represent different lines or circles.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: Given that the polar coordinates of point P are (1, π), then the equation of the line passing through point P and perpendicular to the polar axis is which of the options A, B, C, or D. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall what polar coordinates are. A point in polar coordinates is given as (ρ, θ), where ρ is the distance from the origin (or pole), and θ is the angle measured from the polar axis, which is the positive x-axis in Cartesian coordinates. So, point P is at (1, π), which means it&#39;s 1 unit away from the origin and at an angle of π radians, which is 180 degrees. That places point P at (-1, 0) in Cartesian coordinates, right? Because if you go π radians from the positive x-axis, you&#39;re pointing directly to the left, and then 1 unit in that direction would be (-1, 0).Now, the question asks for the equation of the line that passes through point P and is perpendicular to the polar axis. The polar axis is the positive x-axis, so a line perpendicular to that would be a vertical line in Cartesian coordinates. Wait, is that correct? If the polar axis is the x-axis, then a line perpendicular to it would be vertical, yes. So, in Cartesian terms, a vertical line passing through (-1, 0) would be x = -1. So, I need to find the polar equation of the vertical line x = -1.Alternatively, maybe I can think directly in polar coordinates. Let me recall some standard polar equations. A vertical line in Cartesian coordinates x = a can be written in polar coordinates as ρ = a / cos θ, right? Because x = ρ cos θ, so if x = a, then ρ cos θ = a, so ρ = a / cos θ. Similarly, a horizontal line y = b would be ρ sin θ = b, so ρ = b / sin θ.But in this case, the vertical line is x = -1. So substituting a = -1 into the equation ρ = a / cos θ would give ρ = -1 / cos θ. That is, ρ = -1 / cos θ. Let me check that. If we take ρ cos θ = x = -1, so ρ cos θ = -1, which leads to ρ = -1 / cos θ. So, that seems to be the equation. Let me verify this with some angles.For example, when θ = 0, cos θ = 1, so ρ = -1. But θ = 0 is the positive x-axis, so ρ = -1 would mean going 1 unit in the opposite direction, which is to the left, so that&#39;s (-1, 0), which is on the line x = -1. Similarly, when θ = π/2, which is straight up along the y-axis, cos θ = 0, so ρ would approach infinity, which makes sense because a vertical line x = -1 doesn&#39;t intersect the y-axis. When θ = π, cos θ = -1, so ρ = -1 / (-1) = 1. So, at θ = π, ρ = 1, which is the point (1, π), which is again (-1, 0) in Cartesian coordinates. That checks out.Wait, but the problem states that the line passes through point P, which is (1, π). So when θ = π, ρ = 1. Plugging into the equation ρ = -1 / cos θ, let&#39;s see: cos π = -1, so -1 / (-1) = 1. So ρ = 1, which matches the coordinates of point P. So that seems correct.Looking at the options given:A: ρ = 1B: ρ = cos θC: ρ = -1 / cos θD: ρ = 1 / cos θSo, the equation I derived is ρ = -1 / cos θ, which is option C. Let me just check if any of the other options could also represent a vertical line through (-1, 0).Option A: ρ = 1. That&#39;s a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. So that&#39;s all points 1 unit from the origin, which is not a line. So A is a circle, not the line we want.Option B: ρ = cos θ. Let me recall that in polar coordinates, ρ = cos θ is a circle. Specifically, it&#39;s a circle with diameter along the polar axis from (0,0) to (1,0). So in Cartesian coordinates, that&#39;s the circle (x - 0.5)^2 + y^2 = (0.5)^2. This circle passes through the origin and (1,0). But we need a vertical line at x = -1, so this isn&#39;t it.Option C: ρ = -1 / cos θ. As we saw earlier, this is equivalent to x = -1 in Cartesian coordinates, which is the vertical line passing through (-1, 0), which includes point P. So that&#39;s correct.Option D: ρ = 1 / cos θ. That&#39;s equivalent to x = 1, because ρ cos θ = 1, so x = 1. That&#39;s the vertical line passing through (1, 0), which is not the point P given here. So D is incorrect.Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.But let me just double-check in case I made a mistake in the conversion. Let&#39;s start from the Cartesian equation. If the line is x = -1, then converting to polar coordinates:x = ρ cos θ = -1So, ρ cos θ = -1Therefore, solving for ρ, we get ρ = -1 / cos θ, which is exactly option C. So that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, I can think of other ways to represent vertical lines in polar coordinates. For example, in general, the polar equation for a vertical line x = a is ρ = a / cos θ. But if a is negative, then we have ρ = a / cos θ, which is the same as ρ = -|a| / cos θ. In our case, a = -1, so ρ = -1 / cos θ, which is option C. So that matches.Another way to test this is to plug in different θ values and see if they lie on x = -1.Take θ = π/3 (60 degrees). Then cos θ = 0.5, so ρ = -1 / 0.5 = -2. So ρ = -2 at θ = π/3. But in polar coordinates, a negative radius means you go in the opposite direction, so θ = π/3 + π = 4π/3. So the point would be (2, 4π/3). Let&#39;s convert that to Cartesian: x = 2 cos(4π/3) = 2*(-0.5) = -1, y = 2 sin(4π/3) = 2*(-√3/2) = -√3. So the point (-1, -√3) is on the line x = -1, which is correct. Similarly, another angle θ = π/2 (90 degrees). Then cos θ = 0, so ρ approaches infinity, which makes sense because the line x = -1 is vertical and doesn&#39;t intersect the y-axis. So as θ approaches π/2, ρ approaches infinity, which is consistent.Alternatively, take θ = π/4 (45 degrees). Then cos θ = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, so ρ = -1 / (√2/2) = -√2 ≈ -1.414. So ρ is negative, which means we add π to θ, giving θ = 5π/4. Converting to Cartesian: x = √2 cos(5π/4) = √2*(-√2/2) = -1, y = √2 sin(5π/4) = √2*(-√2/2) = -1. So the point (-1, -1) is on x = -1. Correct again.So all these test points confirm that option C gives the correct vertical line x = -1. Therefore, the answer should be C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the polar coordinates of point ( P ) are ((1, pi)), we need to find the equation of the line passing through point ( P ) and perpendicular to the polar axis.1. Convert Polar Coordinates to Cartesian Coordinates:   - The point ( P ) in polar coordinates ((1, pi)) corresponds to the Cartesian coordinates ((-1, 0)) because ( rho = 1 ) and ( theta = pi ) radians (180 degrees).2. Determine the Line Equation in Cartesian Coordinates:   - A line perpendicular to the polar axis (which is the x-axis) is a vertical line. The vertical line passing through ((-1, 0)) is ( x = -1 ).3. Convert the Cartesian Equation to Polar Coordinates:   - The Cartesian equation ( x = -1 ) can be converted to polar coordinates using ( x = rho cos theta ).   - Substituting ( x = -1 ) gives ( rho cos theta = -1 ).   - Solving for ( rho ) results in ( rho = -frac{1}{cos theta} ).4. Verify with Given Options:   - The derived equation ( rho = -frac{1}{cos theta} ) matches option C.5. Check Other Options:   - Option A (( rho = 1 )) is a circle, not a line.   - Option B (( rho = cos theta )) is a circle, not the correct vertical line.   - Option D (( rho = frac{1}{cos theta} )) represents the line ( x = 1 ), not ( x = -1 ).Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{C}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-618a4ba7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-618a4ba7><span class="icon" data-v-618a4ba7>🔑:</span>AnalysisThis question tests the conversion between polar coordinates and Cartesian coordinates.

The question is about a linear function y = kx + b not passing through the first quadrant. I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, D is correct. Hmm. Let me recall that the first quadrant is where both x and y are positive. So if the graph doesn&#39;t go through the first quadrant, that means there are no points (x, y) on the line where x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0. First, let me visualize the coordinate system. The first quadrant is the top-right section. So the line should never enter that area. To do that, the line must either stay entirely below the x-axis or to the left of the y-axis. But since it&#39;s a linear function (which is a straight line), unless it&#39;s horizontal or vertical. Wait, but linear functions have the form y = kx + b, so they can&#39;t be vertical. So vertical lines aren&#39;t functions. So the line must be horizontal or have some slope. If the line is horizontal, then it&#39;s y = b. If b is positive, then the entire line is in the first and second quadrants. If b is negative, it&#39;s in the third and fourth. So if it&#39;s horizontal with b &lt;= 0, it doesn&#39;t enter the first quadrant. But the problem isn&#39;t limited to horizontal lines. So maybe we need to consider both slope and y-intercept.For a line to not pass through the first quadrant, when x is positive, y must not be positive. So for all x &gt; 0, y &lt;= 0. Let&#39;s express that in terms of the equation. For x &gt; 0, kx + b &lt;= 0. So, we need kx + b &lt;= 0 for all x &gt; 0. Wait, but if k is positive, then as x increases, kx + b will increase without bound. So if k is positive, then as x approaches infinity, y approaches infinity, which would definitely enter the first quadrant. Therefore, if k &gt; 0, the line will eventually go into the first quadrant, regardless of b. So that means k cannot be positive. So k must be negative. That rules out options A and B because they have k &gt; 0. So now it&#39;s between C and D: k &lt; 0.Now, if k is negative, then the line is decreasing. So when x increases, y decreases. So to ensure that for all x &gt; 0, y &lt;= 0, we need that even at x = 0, y is &lt;= 0. Wait, but x = 0 is the y-intercept. So when x = 0, y = b. Therefore, if b &lt;= 0, then at x = 0, y is already not in the first quadrant. But since the line is decreasing (k &lt; 0), as x increases (x &gt; 0), y will decrease further, so y will become even more negative. Therefore, if b &lt;= 0 and k &lt; 0, then the line will never enter the first quadrant. But wait, what if b is positive? If k is negative and b is positive, then the line crosses the y-axis at a positive value (first quadrant), and then as x increases, y decreases. So at x = 0, it&#39;s in the first quadrant. But the question says the graph does not pass through the first quadrant. So even crossing the y-axis in the first quadrant would mean it passes through the first quadrant, right? Therefore, if b &gt; 0, even if the line is decreasing, it still starts in the first quadrant. Hence, to not pass through the first quadrant at all, the y-intercept b must be &lt;= 0. But in the options, C is k &lt; 0, b &gt; 0 and D is k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0. Wait, but if b = 0, then the line passes through the origin, which is on the boundary of the first quadrant. But the origin isn&#39;t in any quadrant. So if b = 0, the line is y = kx with k &lt; 0. Then for x &gt; 0, y is negative (since k &lt; 0), so the line is in the fourth quadrant for x &gt; 0 and second quadrant for x &lt; 0. So it doesn&#39;t enter the first quadrant. But the options don&#39;t include k &lt; 0, b &lt;= 0. The options have D as k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0. So in the case of b = 0, it&#39;s not covered by any option. But maybe the problem assumes that if the line passes through the origin, it&#39;s not considered as passing through the first quadrant. But technically, the origin isn&#39;t part of any quadrant. So maybe in this problem, if the line doesn&#39;t go through the first quadrant, even if it&#39;s on the axes, then b must be &lt;= 0 and k &lt; 0. But the options don&#39;t include an option with b &lt;= 0. Let&#39;s check the options again:A: k &gt; 0, b &gt; 0B: k &gt; 0, b &lt; 0C: k &lt; 0, b &gt; 0D: k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0So, if b = 0 is allowed, then none of the options include that. But since all options have strict inequalities (either &gt; or &lt;), not &lt;= or &gt;=, then perhaps the problem considers that even touching the axes is allowed. Wait, but if the line is on the x-axis (y=0), it&#39;s not passing through the first quadrant. Similarly, if it&#39;s on the y-axis (x=0), unless y is positive, but x=0, y=b. So if b is positive, then (0, b) is on the y-axis, which is between the first and second quadrants. The y-axis isn&#39;t part of any quadrant. So maybe the line is allowed to be on the axes but not in the open quadrants.So, in the problem statement, if the graph does not pass through the first quadrant, then it can touch the axes but can&#39;t have points where both x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0. So, if the line has a point where x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0, then it&#39;s in the first quadrant. To prevent that, we need for all x &gt; 0, y &lt;= 0.So, given y = kx + b, for x &gt; 0, kx + b &lt;= 0. Let&#39;s think of this as an inequality that must hold for all x &gt; 0.For the inequality kx + b &lt;= 0 to hold for all x &gt; 0, we need that as x approaches infinity, the left-hand side tends to either positive or negative infinity. If k is positive, as x approaches infinity, kx + b tends to infinity, which would not satisfy the inequality. Therefore, k must be negative. If k is negative, then as x increases, kx decreases, so kx + b will decrease. Therefore, the maximum value of y for x &gt; 0 occurs at the smallest x, which is x approaching 0 from the right. So, the limit as x approaches 0+ of y is b. Therefore, to ensure that even the maximum possible y for x &gt; 0 is &lt;= 0, we must have b &lt;= 0. Therefore, combining both conditions, k &lt; 0 and b &lt;= 0. But in the options given, D is k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, and C is k &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0. Since b &lt;= 0 includes b = 0 and b &lt; 0, but the options don&#39;t include equality. So if b = 0 is allowed, then technically the correct answer would be k &lt; 0 and b &lt;= 0, but since that&#39;s not an option, maybe the problem assumes that the line does not pass through the origin either. Wait, but the origin is not in the first quadrant, so even if the line passes through the origin, it&#39;s not in the first quadrant. So in that case, b = 0 would still satisfy the condition. But since the options don&#39;t include k &lt; 0 and b &lt;= 0, but D is k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, maybe the answer is D. Wait, but if b = 0, then the line is y = kx with k &lt; 0, which passes through the origin. But the origin is not in the first quadrant, so even with b = 0, the line doesn&#39;t pass through the first quadrant. However, the options are only D: k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0 and C: k &lt; 0, b &gt; 0. So if b = 0 is allowed, then technically the answer would require b &lt;= 0, but since D is only b &lt; 0, maybe the problem expects that. Wait, perhaps when they say the graph does not pass through the first quadrant, they mean it doesn&#39;t pass through any part of the first quadrant, including the axes. But that&#39;s conflicting because axes are not part of any quadrant. So I&#39;m a bit confused here.Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that if the line passes through the origin, then it&#39;s in the first quadrant because the origin is sometimes considered part of all quadrants, but actually, no, the origin is not part of any quadrant. So even if the line passes through the origin, it&#39;s not in the first quadrant. Therefore, the case b = 0 is allowed. However, since in the options, there is no option with k &lt; 0 and b &lt;= 0, but only k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, maybe the answer is D. Alternatively, maybe even with b = 0, the line y = kx with k &lt; 0 does pass through the first quadrant? Wait, when x is positive, y is negative. So for x &gt; 0, y = kx is negative because k is negative? Wait, no. If k is negative, then kx is negative when x is positive, so y is negative. Therefore, for all x &gt; 0, y is negative. Therefore, the line is in the fourth quadrant for x &gt; 0 and in the second quadrant for x &lt; 0. So it never enters the first quadrant. Therefore, even if b = 0, the line does not pass through the first quadrant. Therefore, if b &lt;= 0 and k &lt; 0, the line doesn&#39;t pass through the first quadrant. But since the options don&#39;t include b &lt;= 0, but only b &lt; 0, maybe the problem is considering that the line must not pass through the first quadrant OR the origin. But that&#39;s not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake. But assuming the options are as given, and we need to pick between C and D. If we take b &gt; 0 and k &lt; 0, then the line crosses the y-axis at a positive value, so when x = 0, y = b &gt; 0, which is in the second quadrant. Then, as x increases, y decreases. So the line will cross the x-axis at some point x = -b/k (since kx + b = 0 =&gt; x = -b/k). Since k is negative, -b/k is positive (because b is positive, so -b is negative, divided by k which is negative, gives positive). So the line crosses the x-axis at a positive x value. Therefore, between x = 0 and x = -b/k, the line is in the second quadrant (from x=0, y=b) to x = -b/k, y=0. Then, for x &gt; -b/k, y becomes negative, so in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the line passes through the second and fourth quadrants. But does it pass through the first quadrant? At x &gt; -b/k, y is negative, so no. Between x=0 and x = -b/k, the y-values are positive (since x is positive, but y starts at b and decreases to 0). Wait, x=0 to x=-b/k is x in (0, -b/k). But x is positive here, and y is from b to 0. So in that interval, x is positive and y is positive (from b down to 0). Therefore, the line does pass through the first quadrant in that interval. Therefore, if k &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0, then the line does pass through the first quadrant for x between 0 and -b/k. Therefore, option C is invalid because it allows the line to pass through the first quadrant. Therefore, if k &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0, the line does pass through the first quadrant. So C is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer must be D: k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0.Let me verify. If both k and b are negative, then the y-intercept is negative. So when x = 0, y = b &lt; 0, which is in the third or fourth quadrant. Then, since the slope is negative, as x increases, y decreases further. So for x positive, y becomes even more negative. Therefore, the line is in the fourth quadrant for x &gt; 0, and in the third quadrant for x &lt; 0. Therefore, it never enters the first or second quadrants. Hence, if k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, the graph does not pass through the first quadrant. Alternatively, if b is negative and k is negative, when x is negative, let&#39;s see. If x is negative, then kx is positive (since k is negative and x is negative). So y = kx + b = positive + negative. Depending on the magnitudes, it could be positive or negative. For example, if b = -2 and k = -1, then for x = -3, y = (-1)(-3) + (-2) = 3 - 2 = 1, which is positive. So at x = -3, y = 1, which is in the second quadrant. So the line passes through the second quadrant here. But the problem says the graph does not pass through the first quadrant. Passing through the second quadrant is allowed. So, in this case, with k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, the line passes through the second, third, and fourth quadrants, but not the first. Therefore, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the correct answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which conditions ensure that the graph of the linear function ( y = kx + b ) does not pass through the first quadrant, we need to analyze the slope ( k ) and y-intercept ( b ).1. Slope Analysis:   - If ( k &gt; 0 ), the line will eventually rise to positive infinity as ( x ) increases, which means it will enter the first quadrant. Therefore, ( k ) must be negative (( k &lt; 0 )).   2. Y-intercept Analysis:   - The y-intercept ( b ) determines where the line crosses the y-axis. If ( b &gt; 0 ), the line crosses the y-axis in the first quadrant. To avoid this, ( b ) must be non-positive. However, if ( b = 0 ), the line passes through the origin, which is not in any quadrant. For the line to avoid the first quadrant entirely, ( b ) must be negative (( b &lt; 0 )).3. Combining Conditions:   - With ( k &lt; 0 ) and ( b &lt; 0 ), the line will cross the y-axis in the fourth quadrant (since ( b &lt; 0 )) and will slope downwards (since ( k &lt; 0 )). This ensures that for all positive ( x ), ( y ) will be negative, and for negative ( x ), ( y ) might be positive but only in the second quadrant, not the first.Thus, the correct answer is (boxed{D}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, D is correct given that the graph of the linear function y = kx + b doesn&#39;t pass through the first quadrant. Let me start by recalling that a linear function is a straight line, and the first quadrant is where both x and y are positive. So, if the line doesn&#39;t pass through the first quadrant, that means there&#39;s no point (x, y) on the line where x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0. First, let&#39;s remember what the graph of y = kx + b looks like. The slope is k, which determines if the line is increasing or decreasing. If k is positive, the line goes up from left to right; if k is negative, it goes down. The y-intercept is b, which is where the line crosses the y-axis (when x=0). So, if b is positive, the line crosses the y-axis above the origin; if b is negative, it crosses below.Now, to not pass through the first quadrant, the line must never be in the region where both x and y are positive. Let&#39;s think about different possibilities.Case 1: If the slope k is positive. Then, as x increases, y increases. So, if the line has a positive slope, even if the y-intercept is negative, eventually, as x becomes large enough, y will become positive. That means the line will enter the first quadrant. So, if k is positive, no matter what b is, for large enough x, y will be positive. Therefore, if k &gt; 0, the line will eventually pass through the first quadrant, unless maybe if it&#39;s constrained somehow. Wait, but a line extends infinitely in both directions. So even if b is negative, with k positive, as x increases, y will become positive. So, for example, take k = 1, b = -1. The equation is y = x -1. When x &gt; 1, y becomes positive, so the line does pass through the first quadrant. Therefore, if k is positive, regardless of b, the line will pass through the first quadrant. Therefore, if the line does NOT pass through the first quadrant, k cannot be positive. Therefore, k must be negative. So that rules out options A and B, which have k &gt; 0. So we can narrow it down to options C and D, which have k &lt; 0.Now, between options C and D: C is k &lt; 0, b &gt; 0; D is k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0.Let me think. If k is negative, the line slopes downward from left to right. The y-intercept is b. If b is positive, then the line crosses the y-axis above the origin. Since it&#39;s sloping downward, as x increases, y decreases. So starting from the y-intercept (0, b), moving to the right (increasing x), y becomes smaller. So when x is positive, y starts at b (positive) and decreases. So, will it ever cross into the first quadrant?Wait, the line is already crossing the y-axis at (0, b) where b is positive. So the point (0, b) is on the line. Since (0, b) is on the y-axis, which is the boundary of the first quadrant. But actually, the first quadrant requires both x and y to be positive. So (0, b) is on the y-axis, not in the first quadrant. However, near that point, if we take x slightly positive, y would be slightly less than b. Since b is positive, then for small positive x, y is still positive. Therefore, the line would pass through the first quadrant in that region. For example, take k = -1, b = 2. Then the equation is y = -x + 2. When x is between 0 and 2, y is positive, so those points are in the first quadrant. Therefore, even if k is negative and b is positive, the line does pass through the first quadrant.Therefore, that would mean option C is not correct. Then, the only remaining option is D: k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0.Let&#39;s check that. If both k and b are negative, so the line is sloping downward and crosses the y-axis below the origin. Let&#39;s take an example: k = -2, b = -3. The equation is y = -2x -3. If we plot this, when x is 0, y is -3. As x increases, y becomes more negative. As x decreases (becomes more negative), y becomes positive. So the line is in the third and fourth quadrants. Wait, let me see:For x negative, y = -2x -3. If x is negative, say x = -1, then y = -2*(-1) -3 = 2 -3 = -1. Still negative. If x is more negative, like x = -2, then y = -2*(-2) -3 = 4 -3 = 1. So, when x = -2, y is positive. So the point (-2, 1) is in the second quadrant. Therefore, this line passes through the second and fourth quadrants? Wait, when x is positive, y is negative (since k is negative and x is positive, so kx is negative, plus b negative, so y is negative). When x is negative, depending on how negative, y can be positive or negative. When x is very negative, like x = -10, y = -2*(-10) -3 = 20 -3 = 17, which is positive. So in that case, the line passes through the second quadrant (negative x, positive y) and the fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y). Wait, but it never passes through the first quadrant (positive x, positive y) or the third quadrant (negative x, negative y). Wait, but when x is between 0 and negative numbers, but when x is -1.5, for example, y = -2*(-1.5) -3 = 3 -3 = 0. So the line crosses the x-axis at x = -1.5. So from x = -1.5 to more negative x, y is positive. So the line is in the second quadrant for x &lt; -1.5, and in the fourth quadrant for x &gt; -1.5. Wait, no, because when x is positive, y is negative (fourth quadrant). When x is between -1.5 and 0, y is negative (since for x = -1, y = -2*(-1) -3 = 2 -3 = -1), so that&#39;s third quadrant (negative x, negative y). So the line passes through the second, third, and fourth quadrants. Wait, but for x between -∞ to -1.5, it&#39;s in the second quadrant; from -1.5 to 0, third quadrant; from 0 to ∞, fourth quadrant. So it never enters the first quadrant. Therefore, if k &lt; 0 and b &lt; 0, the line does not pass through the first quadrant. Therefore, option D is correct.But let&#39;s confirm with another example. Let k = -1, b = -1. So y = -x -1. When x is positive, y is negative. When x is negative, y = -x -1. If x is -2, y = 2 -1 = 1, which is positive (second quadrant). If x is -0.5, y = 0.5 -1 = -0.5 (third quadrant). So again, the line is in second, third, and fourth quadrants. Never the first. Therefore, if k and b are both negative, the line doesn&#39;t pass through the first quadrant.Therefore, the answer should be D: k &lt; 0, b &lt; 0.But wait, let me check option C again. Option C is k &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0. Let&#39;s take k = -1, b = 1. So the equation is y = -x + 1. When x is 0, y is 1. When x is positive, y decreases. So when x = 0.5, y = -0.5 +1 = 0.5, which is positive. Therefore, the point (0.5, 0.5) is in the first quadrant. Hence, even with k &lt; 0 and b &gt; 0, the line passes through the first quadrant. Therefore, option C is incorrect. So indeed, only option D is correct.Hence, the answer is D.Final Answerboxed{D}&lt;/think&gt;To determine which option is correct given that the graph of the linear function ( y = kx + b ) does not pass through the first quadrant, we need to analyze the conditions on ( k ) and ( b ).1. Slope Analysis (k):   - If ( k &gt; 0 ), the line slopes upwards. For large positive ( x ), ( y ) will eventually be positive, entering the first quadrant regardless of ( b ). Hence, ( k ) cannot be positive.   - Therefore, ( k ) must be negative (( k &lt; 0 )), narrowing the options to C and D.2. Y-Intercept Analysis (b):   - If ( k &lt; 0 ) and ( b &gt; 0 ), the line crosses the y-axis above the origin. For small positive ( x ), ( y ) remains positive, entering the first quadrant. Hence, ( b ) cannot be positive.   - If ( k &lt; 0 ) and ( b &lt; 0 ), the line crosses the y-axis below the origin. For positive ( x ), ( y ) is negative (fourth quadrant). For negative ( x ), ( y ) can be positive (second quadrant) or negative (third quadrant). The line never enters the first quadrant.Thus, the correct answer is when both ( k ) and ( b ) are negative.[boxed{D}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-618a4ba7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-618a4ba7><span class="icon" data-v-618a4ba7>🔑:</span>Given that the graph of the linear function y = kx + b passes through the second, third, and fourth quadrants, and when k &lt; 0, the line must pass through the second and fourth quadrants.

On a plane, n points with distinct abscissas are marked. Through each pair of points, a parabola, the graph of a quadratic trinomial with a leading coefficient of one, is drawn.

What is the maximum number of good parabolas that could result?</div><div class="divider" data-v-618a4ba7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-618a4ba7><span class="icon" data-v-618a4ba7>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have n points on a plane with distinct abscissas, meaning each point has a unique x-coordinate. Then, through each pair of points, we draw a parabola that&#39;s a quadratic trinomial with a leading coefficient of 1. A parabola is called &quot;good&quot; if there are no marked points on it or above it, except for the two points it&#39;s drawn through. The question is asking for the maximum number of good parabolas possible.First, let me make sure I understand the setup. We have n points, all with different x-coordinates. For every pair of these points, we connect them with a parabola that&#39;s opening upwards (since the leading coefficient is 1). Then, a &quot;good&quot; parabola is one where, except for the two points it connects, there are no other marked points lying on or above the parabola. So, we need to arrange these n points in such a way that as many of these parabolas as possible meet this condition.Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that each parabola is determined by two points, and for it to be good, all other points must lie strictly below the parabola. Since all parabolas open upwards (because the leading coefficient is 1), their shape is a U-shaped curve. So, the vertex of each parabola is the minimum point of the curve, and as we move away from the vertex, the parabola increases towards infinity in both directions.Given that each parabola passes through two points, the rest of the points need to be below this parabola. So, perhaps arranging the points in a certain order where the parabolas formed by consecutive points are more likely to be &quot;good&quot;? Or maybe arranging them in some convex position?Wait, but since all parabolas open upwards, the part of the parabola between the two points might dip below other points, but after the two points, the parabola will rise again. However, since the x-coordinates are distinct, maybe we can arrange the points such that the other points lie either to the left or right of the two points defining the parabola. Then, if the parabola is such that between the two points, it doesn&#39;t go above any other points, but outside the two points, the parabola&#39;s arms go up, but since there are no points there, maybe that&#39;s okay?Wait, but the problem says &quot;no marked points on it or above it, except for the two points through which it is drawn&quot;. So, even if there&#39;s a point far to the right of the two points defining the parabola, if that point is above the parabola, then the parabola isn&#39;t good. So, even though the parabola might go up to infinity, any point with an x-coordinate beyond the two points defining the parabola would be above it once the parabola&#39;s value at that x is less than the point&#39;s y-coordinate. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose we have two points, say (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), with x1 &lt; x2. The parabola passing through them is y = (x - h)^2 + k, but since the leading coefficient is 1, it&#39;s y = x² + bx + c. Alternatively, since it passes through (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can write it as y = (x - x1)(x - x2) + something? Wait, no. The general form is y = x² + bx + c. If we have two points, we can set up two equations:y1 = x1² + b x1 + cy2 = x2² + b x2 + cSolving for b and c. Then, the parabola is determined uniquely.But regardless of that, the parabola is a U-shaped curve. So, between x1 and x2, the parabola will have its minimum (vertex) somewhere. If the two points are such that the parabola between them is below all other points, and outside of them, the parabola rises. But other points could be either to the left of x1, between x1 and x2, or to the right of x2. For the parabola to be good, all other points must lie strictly below the parabola.But if there&#39;s a point to the left of x1, then at that point&#39;s x-coordinate, the parabola&#39;s y-value would be higher (since the parabola is increasing as you go left from the vertex if the vertex is to the right). Wait, no. Wait, since the parabola opens upwards, the arms go up on both sides. The vertex is the minimum point. So, left of the vertex, the parabola is decreasing, and right of the vertex, it&#39;s increasing. Wait, no: For a parabola opening upwards, the vertex is the minimum. So, left of the vertex, as x decreases, y increases. Wait, no, actually, for a standard parabola y = x², the vertex is at (0,0). As x increases or decreases from 0, y increases. So, in general, for a parabola y = (x - h)^2 + k, it opens upwards, vertex at (h, k). For x &lt; h, the function is decreasing (as x increases towards h, y decreases), and for x &gt; h, it&#39;s increasing. So, actually, from left to right, the parabola decreases until the vertex, then increases.Therefore, if the two points on the parabola are on either side of the vertex, then between the two points, the parabola is below the line connecting them. Wait, but actually, the parabola is passing through both points. So, if you have two points on the parabola, one to the left of the vertex and one to the right, then between them, the parabola is dipping below the line segment connecting the two points. However, in our case, the parabola is determined by two points, so the vertex&#39;s position depends on the points.But perhaps it&#39;s better to think in terms of coordinates. Let me take two points, say (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The parabola passing through them is y = x² + bx + c. To find b and c, we have the equations:y1 = x1² + b x1 + cy2 = x2² + b x2 + cSubtracting these two equations, we get y2 - y1 = (x2² - x1²) + b(x2 - x1)So, y2 - y1 = (x2 - x1)(x2 + x1) + b(x2 - x1)Divide both sides by (x2 - x1) (which is non-zero because x1 ≠ x2):(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = x2 + x1 + bTherefore, b = [(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)] - (x2 + x1)Then, c can be found by plugging back into one of the equations:c = y1 - x1² - b x1So, once we have b and c, the parabola is determined. The vertex of the parabola is at x = -b/(2*1) = -b/2.So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/2. Let&#39;s substitute b from above:x_vertex = -[( (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) - x2 - x1 ) / 2 ]Simplify:x_vertex = [ (x2 + x1) - (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) ] / 2Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe it&#39;s manageable. The y-coordinate at the vertex is k = c - b²/4, but maybe we don&#39;t need that.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points such that their coordinates are arranged in a certain way. Since all x-coordinates are distinct, we can order them from left to right as x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn. Let&#39;s assume that the points are ordered by their x-coordinates, so P1 is (x1, y1), P2 is (x2, y2), ..., Pn is (xn, yn), with x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn.Now, for two points Pi and Pj with i &lt; j (so xi &lt; xj), the parabola through them will have its vertex somewhere. Depending on the y-coordinates of Pi and Pj, the vertex can be to the left, between, or to the right of xi and xj.But the key is that for the parabola to be good, all other points must lie strictly below it. So, for any other point Pk (k ≠ i, j), we must have yk &lt; (xk)^2 + b xk + c, where b and c are determined by Pi and Pj.Alternatively, perhaps it&#39;s easier to think in terms of the vertical distance between the points and the parabola. If all other points are below the parabola, then their y-coordinates are less than the value of the parabola at their x-coordinates.Now, the challenge is to arrange the n points such that as many pairs as possible have this property. So, how can we arrange points so that many parabolas don&#39;t have any points above them?This feels similar to problems in computational geometry where you want to maximize the number of edges in a graph such that no edge is crossed by another, or something like that. But here, it&#39;s about parabolas not having points above them.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s analogous to the concept of convex hulls. In convex hulls, for a set of points, the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all points. Points on the convex hull can &quot;see&quot; other points without obstruction. But here, instead of lines, we have parabolas, and instead of visibility, it&#39;s about being below the parabola.Alternatively, if we arrange the points in convex position, but considering parabolas instead of lines. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s consider small cases. Let&#39;s start with n=2. Then, there&#39;s only one parabola, which connects the two points. Since there are no other points, this parabola is automatically good. So, the number of good parabolas is 1.For n=3. We have three points, say P1, P2, P3 with x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3. Each pair forms a parabola. We need to check which of these three parabolas are good.Suppose we arrange the points such that all three lie on a parabola opening upwards. Then, the parabola passing through any two points would have the third point on it, so those parabolas wouldn&#39;t be good. But since the problem states that the points have distinct abscissas, but there&#39;s no restriction on the y-coordinates. However, arranging three points on a single parabola might not be allowed if the problem requires that through each pair of points, a parabola is drawn. But the problem says &quot;quadratic trinomial with leading coefficient of one&quot;. So, each pair defines a unique parabola with leading coefficient 1, so even if three points are colinear, but the parabola is still a quadratic. Wait, but three colinear points can&#39;t lie on a parabola with leading coefficient 1 unless they are arranged in a specific way.Wait, if three colinear points lie on a parabola with leading coefficient 1, then that parabola would have to be a straight line, which is impossible because a parabola with leading coefficient 1 is quadratic, not linear. So, three colinear points cannot lie on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1. Therefore, if we have three points arranged such that they are colinear, then each pair defines a parabola (which is actually a quadratic function) that passes through those two points but not the third. Therefore, in this case, each parabola might have the third point either above or below.Wait, let&#39;s take three points. Let&#39;s arrange them in a way that the middle point is high enough so that the parabolas through the outer two points dip below the middle point. Alternatively, if the middle point is low, the parabolas through the outer points might go above the middle point.Suppose we have three points: P1=(x1, y1), P2=(x2, y2), P3=(x3, y3), with x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3.If we set the middle point P2 very low, then the parabola through P1 and P3 might pass below P2, making that parabola not good because P2 is below it? Wait, no. Wait, a parabola is good if there are no marked points on it or above it, except the two points. So, if the parabola passes through P1 and P3, and P2 is below the parabola, then that&#39;s okay. Because the parabola is above P2. Wait, no: if P2 is below the parabola, then the parabola is above P2, which is allowed. The condition is that there are no marked points on or above the parabola, except the two points. So, if other points are below the parabola, then it&#39;s fine.Therefore, for the parabola through P1 and P3 to be good, P2 must lie below the parabola. Similarly, the parabola through P1 and P2 will have P3 either above or below, and similarly for the parabola through P2 and P3.Wait, so if we arrange the three points such that P2 is the lowest point, then the parabola through P1 and P3 would be above P2, hence acceptable. Then, the parabola through P1 and P2: let&#39;s see. If P3 is above that parabola, then the parabola through P1 and P2 is not good. Similarly, the parabola through P2 and P3: if P1 is above it, then it&#39;s not good.Therefore, if we arrange the three points in a &quot;V&quot; shape, with P2 at the bottom, then:- The parabola through P1 and P3 is above P2, so it&#39;s good.- The parabola through P1 and P2: what about P3? Let&#39;s compute.Let me take specific coordinates. Let’s set x1 = -1, x2 = 0, x3 = 1. Let’s set y1 and y3 to be some value, and y2 lower.Suppose y1 = y3 = 1, y2 = 0.So, P1=(-1,1), P2=(0,0), P3=(1,1).First, parabola through P1 and P3: Let&#39;s find its equation. The parabola is y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (-1,1):1 = 1 - b + c =&gt; -b + c = 0 =&gt; c = b.Plugging in (1,1):1 = 1 + b + c =&gt; b + c = 0.But c = b, so b + b = 0 =&gt; 2b = 0 =&gt; b = 0, c = 0.So the parabola through P1 and P3 is y = x². At x=0, it passes through (0,0), which is P2. Wait, but we set P2 at (0,0). Wait, so the parabola through P1 and P3 actually passes through P2 as well? But that&#39;s impossible, because three points cannot lie on the same parabola unless they satisfy certain conditions. Wait, but here, P1=(-1,1), P2=(0,0), P3=(1,1). The parabola y = x² does pass through all three points. But the problem states that through each pair of points, a parabola is drawn. But in this case, the parabola through P1 and P3 also passes through P2. So, that parabola would have three points on it, which violates the condition of being a &quot;good&quot; parabola, since a good parabola can only have the two points on it. Therefore, in this arrangement, the parabola through P1 and P3 is not good because it has P2 on it.But we wanted to set P2 below the parabola through P1 and P3. Hmm, perhaps my coordinate choice was bad. Let&#39;s choose different coordinates.Let’s try P1=(-1, 2), P2=(0,0), P3=(1, 2). Then, parabola through P1 and P3: let&#39;s compute.Using the same method: y = x² + bx + c.For P1: 2 = 1 - b + c =&gt; -b + c = 1.For P3: 2 = 1 + b + c =&gt; b + c = 1.Adding the two equations: (-b + c) + (b + c) = 1 + 1 =&gt; 2c = 2 =&gt; c = 1. Then, from b + c =1, we get b = 0.Therefore, the parabola is y = x² + 1. At x=0, y=1, which is above P2=(0,0). Therefore, P2 is below the parabola. So, the parabola through P1 and P3 is good because P2 is below it.Now, what about the parabola through P1 and P2: let&#39;s compute that.Equation: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1, 2): 2 = 1 - b + c.Plugging in (0,0): 0 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c = 0.Therefore, 2 = 1 - b =&gt; b = -1.So the equation is y = x² - x. Now, check if P3=(1,2) is above or below this parabola. At x=1, y = 1 -1 = 0. So the parabola at x=1 is 0, but P3 is at (1,2). Therefore, P3 is above this parabola. Hence, the parabola through P1 and P2 is not good.Similarly, the parabola through P2 and P3: compute equation.Plugging in (0,0) and (1,2):For (0,0): 0 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c=0.For (1,2): 2 = 1 + b + 0 =&gt; b=1.Thus, equation: y = x² + x.Check P1=(-1,2). At x=-1, y = 1 -1 = 0. So, the parabola at x=-1 is 0, but P1 is at 2. So, P1 is above the parabola. Hence, this parabola is also not good.Therefore, in this arrangement, only the parabola through P1 and P3 is good. The other two parabolas each have a point above them. So, with n=3, we can have at most 1 good parabola.But is there a way to arrange three points so that all three parabolas are good? Probably not, because each parabola is determined by two points, and the third point is either above or below. If we arrange all three parabolas to have the third point below, then we might have a problem. Wait, but for each parabola, the third point is a different one. For example, in the above example, the parabola through P1 and P3 is good because P2 is below. The parabola through P1 and P2 would need P3 to be below, but in our example, it&#39;s above. Similarly, the parabola through P2 and P3 would need P1 to be below. So, if we can arrange points such that for each pair, the third point is below the parabola, then all three parabolas would be good. Is that possible?Let me try. Let&#39;s set three points such that all are in convex position, but arranged in a way that each parabola through two points lies above the third point.Wait, how? Let&#39;s consider three points where each is the vertex of a parabola passing through the other two. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe we need specific coordinates.Suppose we have three points: P1=(-1,0), P2=(0, -1), P3=(1,0). So, arranged in a V shape, but inverted.Compute the parabola through P1 and P3: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1,0): 0 = 1 - b + c.Plugging in (1,0): 0 = 1 + b + c.Subtracting equations: 0 - 0 = (1 - b + c) - (1 + b + c) =&gt; 0 = -2b =&gt; b=0. Then, c= -1 from first equation.So, parabola is y = x² -1. The vertex is at (0, -1), which is P2. So, this parabola passes through all three points: at x=-1, y=0; x=0, y=-1; x=1, y=0. But that&#39;s impossible because a quadratic can only pass through three points if they are not colinear, but here, the three points are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, the points (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,0) are not colinear. Wait, the line through (-1,0) and (1,0) is horizontal, but (0,-1) is below that. However, the parabola y = x² -1 does pass through all three points. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So, three non-colinear points lying on a parabola. That&#39;s possible because a parabola is a quadratic curve. So, in this case, all three points lie on the same parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P3 also passes through P2, so it&#39;s not a good parabola. Similarly, the parabola through P1 and P2 would be another parabola, but let&#39;s check.Wait, if we take P1=(-1,0) and P2=(0,-1), the parabola through them is y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1,0): 0 = 1 - b + c.Plugging in (0,-1): -1 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c = -1.Then, first equation: 0 = 1 - b -1 =&gt; 0 = -b =&gt; b=0. So the parabola is y = x² -1, which again passes through P3=(1,0). Therefore, again, all three points lie on the same parabola. So, this is a problem. So, if three points lie on a single parabola with leading coefficient 1, then any parabola through two of them will pass through the third, making all parabolas not good. Therefore, to have three points where all parabolas are good, the three points must not lie on a single parabola. So, perhaps arranging them such that each pair&#39;s parabola does not pass through the third.Let me try different coordinates. Let’s set P1=(-2, 2), P2=(0,0), P3=(2, 2).Parabola through P1 and P3: Let&#39;s compute. y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-2, 2): 2 = 4 - 2b + c.Plugging in (2, 2): 2 = 4 + 2b + c.Subtract the two equations: 0 = 4b =&gt; b=0. Then, c=2 -4 = -2. So parabola is y = x² - 2. At x=0, y = -2, which is below P2=(0,0). So, the parabola through P1 and P3 is good.Now, parabola through P1 and P2: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-2,2): 2 = 4 - 2b + c.Plugging in (0,0): 0 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c=0.Thus, 2 = 4 - 2b =&gt; -2b = -2 =&gt; b=1.Equation: y = x² + x. At x=2 (P3), y = 4 + 2 = 6. P3 is at (2,2), which is below 6. So, P3 is below the parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P2 is good.Similarly, parabola through P2 and P3: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (0,0): c=0.Plugging in (2,2): 2 = 4 + 2b =&gt; 2b = -2 =&gt; b = -1.Equation: y = x² - x. At x=-2 (P1), y = 4 - (-2) = 6. P1 is at (-2,2), which is below 6. Therefore, this parabola is also good.So, in this case, all three parabolas are good. Wait, how? Because each parabola, when drawn through two points, has the third point below it. So, this seems possible. So, for n=3, it&#39;s possible to have all three parabolas good.Wait, so in my previous attempt, arranging the points symmetrically around the y-axis with the middle point lower allowed all three parabolas to be good. That&#39;s interesting. So, maybe in general, arranging the points in a convex position where each parabola through two points has all other points below it?But in this case, the three points are arranged such that they form a &quot;V&quot; shape with the bottom at the center. Then, each parabola through two outer points has the vertex at the center, dipping down, and the middle point is at the bottom. Wait, but in this case, the middle point is at the vertex of the parabola through the two outer points. So, in this case, the middle point is exactly at the vertex, which is the minimum of the parabola. Therefore, the parabola through the outer points has its vertex at the middle point. So, the middle point is on the parabola, but in this case, the middle point is part of the parabola. Wait, but in the coordinates I chose earlier, P2=(0,0) was on the parabola through P1=(-2,2) and P3=(2,2), which is y = x² - 2. Wait, but at x=0, y = -2, but P2 is at (0,0). So, that&#39;s different. Wait, no, in the previous example, the parabola through P1=(-2,2) and P3=(2,2) was y = x² - 2, which passes through (0, -2), not (0,0). But in that case, P2=(0,0) is above the parabola at x=0. Wait, no, hold on:Wait, no. If the parabola is y = x² - 2, then at x=0, y = -2. But P2 is (0,0), so the parabola is below P2. So, P2 is above the parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P3 has P2 above it, which would make it not good. But in the previous calculation, when I computed the parabola through P1 and P3, I thought it was y = x² - 2, but P2=(0,0) is above it. Therefore, that parabola is not good. Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. So, where did I go wrong?Wait, let me recast the coordinates. Let me take P1=(-2, 2), P2=(0,0), P3=(2,2). Compute the parabola through P1 and P3.We have two points: (-2,2) and (2,2). The parabola is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, it must be of the form y = x² + c. Plugging in x=2, y=2: 2 = 4 + c =&gt; c = -2. So, parabola is y = x² - 2. At x=0, y = -2. So, P2=(0,0) is above this parabola, which is not allowed. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P3 is not good because there&#39;s a point (P2) above it. Therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect. So, in that arrangement, the parabola through P1 and P3 is not good. Then, why did I think it was good?Wait, when I computed the other parabolas:Parabola through P1 and P2: y = x² + x. At x=2, y=6. P3=(2,2) is below that, so that parabola is good.Parabola through P2 and P3: y = x² - x. At x=-2, y=6. P1=(-2,2) is below that, so that parabola is good.But the parabola through P1 and P3 has P2 above it, so it&#39;s not good. Therefore, only two parabolas are good. So, for n=3, maximum number of good parabolas is 2.But earlier, when I thought all three were good, I was mistaken because I miscalculated the position of P2 relative to the parabola through P1 and P3.So, in this case, two parabolas are good. Is it possible to have all three? If not, then perhaps for n=3, maximum is 2.Wait, let&#39;s try another arrangement. Suppose we have three points arranged in a convex position where all are above each other&#39;s parabolas. Wait, but how? Let&#39;s suppose P1=(-1, 3), P2=(0,1), P3=(1,3). Let&#39;s check the parabolas.Parabola through P1 and P3: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1,3): 3 = 1 - b + c.Plugging in (1,3): 3 = 1 + b + c.Subtracting: 0 = 2b =&gt; b=0. Then, c=3 -1=2. So, parabola is y = x² + 2. At x=0, y=2. P2=(0,1) is below this, so parabola is good.Parabola through P1 and P2: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1,3): 3 = 1 - b + c.Plugging in (0,1): 1 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c=1.Then, 3 = 1 - b +1 =&gt; 3 = 2 - b =&gt; b = -1.Equation: y = x² - x +1. At x=1, y=1 -1 +1=1. P3=(1,3) is above this (since y=3 &gt;1), so parabola is not good.Parabola through P2 and P3: Similarly, equation y = x² + bx +c.Plugging in (0,1): 1=0 +0 +c =&gt; c=1.Plugging in (1,3): 3=1 + b +1 =&gt; b=1.Equation: y = x² + x +1. At x=-1, y=1 -1 +1=1. P1=(-1,3) is above this, so parabola is not good.Therefore, in this arrangement, only the parabola through P1 and P3 is good. So, only one good parabola. Worse than previous.Alternatively, suppose we arrange the three points in a straight line but not horizontal. Wait, but a straight line is not a parabola, so the parabola through two points would curve, and the third point might be above or below.Wait, let&#39;s take three colinear points. Let&#39;s say P1=(0,0), P2=(1,1), P3=(2,2). The parabola through P1 and P2: Let&#39;s compute.Equation y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (0,0): 0 =0 +0 +c =&gt; c=0.Plugging in (1,1):1 =1 +b +0 =&gt; b=0. So, parabola is y =x². At x=2, y=4. The point P3=(2,2) is below this, so the parabola through P1 and P2 is good.Parabola through P2 and P3: Similarly, equation y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (1,1):1 =1 +b +c.Plugging in (2,2):2 =4 +2b +c.Subtract first equation: (2=4 +2b +c) - (1=1 +b +c) =&gt;1=3 +b =&gt;b= -2. Then, from first equation:1=1 -2 +c =&gt;c=2.Equation: y =x² -2x +2. At x=0, y=0 -0 +2=2. P1=(0,0) is below, so parabola is good.Parabola through P1 and P3: y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (0,0):0=0 +0 +c =&gt;c=0.Plugging in (2,2):2=4 +2b +0 =&gt;2b= -2 =&gt;b= -1.Equation: y =x² -x. At x=1, y=1 -1=0. Point P2=(1,1) is above this, so parabola is not good.So, in this case, two parabolas are good, and one is not. So, similar to the previous case. So, it&#39;s two.So, in the case of three colinear points with a slope, two parabolas are good (those connecting consecutive points), and the third parabola (connecting the first and last points) is not good because the middle point is above it.Therefore, for n=3, maximum number of good parabolas is 2.But is there a way to get three? If three points are arranged such that all three parabolas are good, meaning that each parabola doesn&#39;t have the third point above it. For three points, each parabola must have the third point below it.So, for three points P1, P2, P3:- Parabola through P1 and P2 must have P3 below it.- Parabola through P1 and P3 must have P2 below it.- Parabola through P2 and P3 must have P1 below it.So, all three points must lie below each other&#39;s parabolas. Is that possible?Let me attempt coordinates. Let&#39;s take P1=(-1,0), P2=(0,-1), P3=(1,0). Then:Parabola through P1 and P2: y = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (-1,0):0 =1 -b +c.Plugging in (0,-1):-1=0 +0 +c =&gt;c=-1.Therefore, 0=1 -b -1 =&gt; -b=0 =&gt;b=0. So, parabola is y =x² -1. At x=1, y=0. P3=(1,0) is on the parabola. So, not good.Alternatively, let&#39;s try another arrangement. Let’s set P1=(-2,1), P2=(-1,0), P3=(0,1).Compute parabola through P1 and P3:Equation: y =x² + bx +c.Plugging in (-2,1):1 =4 -2b +c.Plugging in (0,1):1=0 +0 +c =&gt;c=1.Therefore, 1=4 -2b +1 =&gt; -2b= -4 =&gt;b=2. So, equation: y =x² +2x +1 = (x+1)^2. At x=-1 (P2), y=0. So, P2 is on the parabola. Not good.Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe it&#39;s impossible to have three points where all three parabolas are good. Because for each parabola, the third point has to be strictly below. But if you have three points, each one must be below the other two parabolas. It&#39;s a cyclic condition. Maybe it&#39;s not possible due to some geometric constraint.Alternatively, maybe arranging the three points in a triangular formation where each is below the others&#39; parabolas. But I can&#39;t seem to find such coordinates. Let&#39;s try.Let’s take P1=(0,0), P2=(1,1), P3=(2,0). So, similar to a V-shape.Parabola through P1 and P3: y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (0,0): c=0.Plugging in (2,0):0=4 +2b =&gt;b=-2. So, equation: y =x² -2x. The vertex is at x=1, y=1 -2= -1. At x=1, the parabola has y=-1. P2=(1,1) is above the parabola, so the parabola through P1 and P3 is not good.Parabola through P1 and P2: y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (0,0):c=0.Plugging in (1,1):1=1 +b =&gt;b=0. So, equation:y=x². At x=2, y=4. P3=(2,0) is below, so good.Parabola through P2 and P3:y=x² +bx +c.Plugging in (1,1):1=1 +b +c.Plugging in (2,0):0=4 +2b +c.Subtract: 0 -1 = (4 +2b +c) - (1 +b +c) =&gt; -1=3 +b =&gt;b=-4. Then c=1 -1 -(-4)=4.Equation:y =x² -4x +4 = (x-2)^2. At x=0, y=4. P1=(0,0) is below, so parabola is good.Thus, in this arrangement, two parabolas are good (P1-P2 and P2-P3), and one is not (P1-P3). So, again, two.Therefore, it seems for n=3, the maximum number of good parabolas is 2. Hence, conjecture: for n points arranged in order, the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1, similar to the convex hull. But let&#39;s check for n=4.Wait, for n=3, we get 2, which is n-1. For n=2, 1, which is also n-1. Maybe this pattern continues? Let&#39;s check for n=4.Suppose we have four points arranged in convex position, say in a convex quadrilateral. Let&#39;s assume they are arranged such that each consecutive pair forms a parabola that&#39;s good. Wait, but how?Alternatively, arrange the points in such a way that each parabola connecting consecutive points is good, and the others are not. For example, if you arrange four points in a convex &quot;zig-zag&quot; where each parabola through consecutive points is below the others.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we need a different approach. Let&#39;s consider that each good parabola corresponds to an edge on the upper convex hull. Wait, in computational geometry, the upper convex hull consists of the edges that are above all other points. But here, it&#39;s the opposite: the parabolas need to have all other points below them.Wait, actually, if we think of the upper convex hull as the set of edges that have all points below them, but here, the parabolas are curves. However, perhaps the maximum number of good parabolas corresponds to the number of edges on the upper convex hull or something similar.Alternatively, if we consider the points sorted by x-coordinate, then a parabola connecting two points Pi and Pj (i &lt; j) is good if all points between Pi and Pj are below the parabola. But since the parabola is a U-shaped curve opening upwards, the minimum is at its vertex. If the vertex is between Pi and Pj, then between Pi and Pj, the parabola dips below the line segment connecting them. However, if the points between Pi and Pj are below the parabola, then maybe it&#39;s similar to the concept of a convex hull, where the upper edges are those that are above all points.Wait, maybe we can model this as a convex hull problem but with respect to the parabolas. Let&#39;s imagine that the &quot;good&quot; parabolas are those that form the upper boundary of the set of points when viewed under the lens of quadratic functions. However, I&#39;m not sure if this directly translates.Alternatively, think of each parabola as a quadratic function. For two points Pi and Pj, the parabola is the quadratic function that passes through them. For this parabola to be good, all other points must lie below it. Thus, the quadratic function must be an upper boundary for all other points.This is similar to the concept of a convex hull, where edges are part of the convex hull if all other points lie below them. However, here, instead of straight lines, we have quadratic functions. So, the set of good parabolas would form a kind of &quot;quadratic convex hull&quot;.But since quadratic functions can curve, the number of such parabolas could be different. However, perhaps the maximum number of good parabolas corresponds to n-1, similar to the convex hull.Wait, but for n=3, we saw that two parabolas can be good, which is n-1. For n=4, would it be 3?Wait, let&#39;s try n=4. Let&#39;s arrange four points in a convex position, such that each consecutive pair forms a good parabola.Let’s take points in order of increasing x-coordinate: P1, P2, P3, P4.Assume they are arranged such that each parabola through Pi and Pi+1 has all other points below it.For this to happen, each consecutive pair must form a parabola that is above all other points.How can we arrange points to satisfy this? Let&#39;s take points in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; pattern where each peak is high enough so that the parabola through the two adjacent points stays above the others.Alternatively, arrange the points such that each consecutive pair&#39;s parabola is high enough to cover the other points.Alternatively, think of the points as lying on a higher parabola, such that each consecutive pair&#39;s parabola is a part of this higher structure.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s easier to consider a specific example.Let’s set four points: P1=(-3, 9), P2=(-1, 1), P3=(1, 1), P4=(3, 9). So, these points are symmetric about the y-axis. The parabola through P1 and P4 is y =x². Let&#39;s check other points.Wait, compute the parabola through P1=(-3,9) and P4=(3,9). The equation is y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-3,9):9=9 -3b +c.Plugging in (3,9):9=9 +3b +c.Subtract equations: 0=6b =&gt; b=0. Then, c=9 -9 +0=0. So, parabola is y=x². The points P2=(-1,1) and P3=(1,1) are on this parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P4 is not good because it contains P2 and P3.So, bad example.Alternatively, let&#39;s take points similar to the n=3 case. Let’s take P1=(-3, a), P2=(-1, b), P3=(1, b), P4=(3, a). Arrange a and b such that the parabolas through consecutive points are above the others.Compute the parabola through P1 and P2: y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-3,a): a =9 -3b +c.Plugging in (-1,b): b =1 -b +c.From the second equation: b =1 -b +c =&gt; 2b -c =1.From first equation: a =9 -3b +c.Let’s set a=10 for high value. Then, from first equation:10=9 -3b +c =&gt; c=1 +3b.From second equation:2b - (1 +3b)=1 =&gt; -b -1=1 =&gt; -b=2 =&gt;b=-2. Then, c=1 +3*(-2)=1 -6=-5.So, the parabola through P1=(-3,10) and P2=(-1,-2) is y=x² -2x -5.Check other points:At x=1 (P3), y=1 -2 -5=-6. P3=(1,b). If we set P3=(1,-2), then y=-6 &lt; -2, so P3 is above the parabola. Wait, no. The parabola at x=1 is -6, and P3 is at (1,-2). So, P3 is above the parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P2 is not good.Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps if we arrange the points in increasing order and each consecutive pair&#39;s parabola is above the next point. Wait, let&#39;s take four points with x-coordinates 1,2,3,4.Let’s define y-coordinates such that each consecutive pair&#39;s parabola is above the other points.Start with P1=(1, y1), P2=(2, y2), P3=(3, y3), P4=(4, y4).We need:- Parabola through P1 and P2 is above P3 and P4.- Parabola through P2 and P3 is above P1 and P4.- Parabola through P3 and P4 is above P1 and P2.Additionally, maybe the parabolas through P1 and P3, P1 and P4, P2 and P4 are not good, but we just need to maximize the number of good ones.But this approach might get complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern here.Alternatively, think recursively. If for n points, the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1, then adding a new point can add one more good parabola. But need to verify.Wait, for n=2, 1; n=3, 2; n=4, 3; so the pattern would be n-1.But how to confirm this?Suppose we have n points arranged in such a way that their y-coordinates are strictly decreasing as we move away from the center. For example, suppose n is even, and we have points symmetric around the y-axis, with the innermost points having the highest y-coordinates, and the outer points having lower y-coordinates. Then, the parabola through each pair of symmetric points might be good.Wait, but this is vague. Alternatively, arrange the points in a convex position where each consecutive pair forms a parabola that&#39;s above all other points. This would be similar to the upper convex hull, but using parabolas.Wait, in the upper convex hull, each edge is part of the convex hull and has all points below it. If we can model the &quot;good&quot; parabolas as analogous to the upper convex hull edges, then the number of good parabolas would be equal to the number of edges on the upper convex hull, which for points in general position is n-1. However, since we&#39;re using parabolas instead of lines, the upper convex hull concept might not directly apply.Wait, but in the example with n=3, we saw that two parabolas can be good, which is n-1. If we can generalize this, then perhaps for n points, the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.Alternatively, another angle: For each good parabola, there are two points. To maximize the number of good parabolas, we need as many pairs as possible where the parabola through them is above all other points. This is similar to the concept of dominance in geometry, where a pair (Pi, Pj) dominates all other points if they lie below the parabola through Pi and Pj.In the plane, for dominance with respect to a parabola, the maximum number of such pairs would be related to the number of pairs that can be arranged such that their parabolas form an upper envelope.In computational geometry, the upper envelope of a set of functions is the function that is the pointwise maximum of all the functions. For quadratic functions, the upper envelope can have complexity O(n), but each pair of functions can intersect at most twice. However, in our case, we&#39;re dealing with parabolas through two points each, so perhaps the upper envelope would have O(n) complexity, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, if we arrange all points in a convex position where each consecutive pair forms a parabola that is part of the upper envelope, then the number of such parabolas would be linear in n.But perhaps a more combinatorial approach is needed. Suppose we arrange the points in such a way that each parabola corresponds to an edge in a convex polygon, but adjusted for parabolas.Wait, another idea: For points sorted by x-coordinate, if we arrange their y-coordinates in a strictly convex function, such as y = f(x) where f is convex, then the parabolas through consecutive points would be below the function, hence the points would lie above the parabolas. But we need the opposite: the parabolas should be above the other points. So, maybe if we arrange the points such that their y-coordinates form a concave function, then the parabolas through consecutive points might lie above the other points.Wait, let&#39;s suppose we have points arranged with x-coordinates x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn and y-coordinates forming a concave function, like y = -x². Then, the parabolas through consecutive points might have other points below them. Let&#39;s test with four points.Take four points: P1=(-2, -4), P2=(-1, -1), P3=(1, -1), P4=(2, -4). So, they form a concave shape.Parabola through P1 and P2: y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-2, -4): -4 =4 -2b +c.Plugging in (-1, -1): -1 =1 -b +c.Subtract the second equation from the first: -3 =3 -b =&gt; -6 = -b =&gt;b=6.Then, from second equation: -1 =1 -6 +c =&gt;c=4.Equation:y =x² +6x +4. This is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at x=-3, y= -5. Let&#39;s check other points:At x=1, y=1 +6 +4=11. P3=(1, -1) is below. At x=2, y=4 +12 +4=20. P4=(2, -4) is below. So, the parabola through P1 and P2 is good.Similarly, parabola through P2 and P3:Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-1, -1): -1 =1 -b +c.Plugging in (1, -1): -1 =1 +b +c.Subtract equations: 0 =2 +2b =&gt;b=-1.Then, from first equation: -1 =1 -(-1) +c =&gt; -1 =2 +c =&gt;c=-3.Equation:y =x² -x -3. Vertex at x=0.5, y= -3.25.Check other points:At x=-2, y=4 +2 -3=3. P1=(-2, -4) is below.At x=2, y=4 -2 -3=-1. P4=(2, -4) is below. So, parabola through P2 and P3 is good.Parabola through P3 and P4:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (1, -1): -1 =1 +b +c.Plugging in (2, -4): -4 =4 +2b +c.Subtract equations: -3 =3 +b =&gt;b=-6.Then, from first equation: -1 =1 -6 +c =&gt;c=4.Equation:y =x² -6x +4. Vertex at x=3, y= -5.Check other points:At x=-2, y=4 +12 +4=20. P1=(-2, -4) is below.At x=-1, y=1 +6 +4=11. P2=(-1, -1) is below. So, parabola is good.Now, the parabola through P1 and P3:Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-2, -4): -4 =4 -2b +c.Plugging in (1, -1): -1 =1 +b +c.Subtract equations: 3 = -3b =&gt;b=-1.Then, from second equation: -1 =1 -1 +c =&gt;c=-1.Equation:y =x² -x -1. At x=2, y=4 -2 -1=1. P4=(2, -4) is below. But also check x=-1: y=1 +1 -1=1. P2=(-1, -1) is below. So, this parabola is also good.Wait, but this contradicts our previous assumption. How come the parabola through P1 and P3 is also good? Because all other points are below it.But according to this arrangement, multiple non-consecutive parabolas can be good. Wait, this suggests that maybe the maximum number is more than n-1.Wait, in this case, we have four points arranged concavely, and all six parabolas are good? Because:- Parabola through P1 and P2: good.- Parabola through P1 and P3: good.- Parabola through P1 and P4: Let&#39;s compute.Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-2, -4): -4 =4 -2b +c.Plugging in (2, -4): -4 =4 +2b +c.Subtract equations: 0 =4b =&gt;b=0. Then, c=-8.Equation:y =x² -8. At x=-1, y=1 -8=-9 &lt; -1 (P2). At x=1, y=1 -8=-7 &lt; -1 (P3). So, parabola is good.Similarly, parabola through P2 and P4:Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-1, -1): -1 =1 -b +c.Plugging in (2, -4): -4 =4 +2b +c.Subtract: -3 =3 +3b =&gt;-6=3b =&gt;b=-2. Then, c=-1 -1 +2=0.Equation:y =x² -2x. At x=1, y=1 -2=-1, which is P3=(1, -1). So, parabola passes through P3, which is not allowed. Hence, this parabola is not good.Similarly, parabola through P2 and P4 has P3 on it, so it&#39;s not good.Parabola through P3 and P4 is already good.Parabola through P2 and P4 is not good.Parabola through P1 and P3 is good.Parabola through P1 and P4 is good.Parabola through P2 and P3 is good.Wait, so in total, how many good parabolas are there?Total pairs: C(4,2)=6.- P1-P2: good- P1-P3: good- P1-P4: good- P2-P3: good- P2-P4: bad (passes through P3)- P3-P4: goodSo, total of 5 good parabolas out of 6. That&#39;s more than n-1=3. Hmm, this contradicts the previous assumption.But wait, in this specific arrangement, almost all parabolas are good except the ones that skip a point in the concave chain. So, parabola through P2 and P4 passes through P3, hence not good. Similarly, parabola through P1 and P3 skips P2 and P4, but in this case, P2 and P4 are below.Wait, parabola through P1 and P3 was computed as y =x² -x -1. At x=-1 (P2&#39;s x), y=1 +1 -1=1, which is above P2=(-1, -1). At x=2, y=4 -2 -1=1, which is above P4=(2, -4). Therefore, the parabola through P1 and P3 is good because P2 and P4 are below it. Similarly, parabola through P1 and P4 is y =x² -8, which at x=-1 is -7 &lt; -1 (P2), and at x=1 is -7 &lt; -1 (P3). So, good.Similarly, parabola through P2 and P3 is good.Parabola through P3 and P4 is good.So, in this arrangement, five out of six parabolas are good. The only bad one is P2-P4, which passes through P3.Therefore, for n=4, we can have 5 good parabolas. But 5 is equal to C(4,2) -1=5. Hmm, but how?Wait, but how does this scale? If we can have C(n,2) - (number of bad parabolas), and if the number of bad parabolas is small, maybe the maximum number is C(n,2) - O(n). But in the example for n=4, only one bad parabola. So, perhaps the maximum number is C(n,2) - (n-2). But this is just a guess.Wait, for n=4, C(4,2)=6. If we have one bad parabola, then 6 -1=5.For n=3, C(3,2)=3. If we have one bad parabola, then 3 -1=2, which matches our previous result.For n=2, C(2,2)=1, 1 -0=1.So, perhaps the number of bad parabolas is (n-2). Therefore, the maximum number of good parabolas is C(n,2) - (n-2) = [n(n-1)/2] - (n-2) = (n² -n -2n +4)/2 = (n² -3n +4)/2.Wait, for n=4, that gives (16 -12 +4)/2=8/2=4, but in our example, we have 5 good parabolas. So, that formula is invalid.Alternatively, maybe the number of bad parabolas is something else. In the n=4 example, only one bad parabola. For n=3, one bad parabola. For n=2, zero. So, maybe the number of bad parabolas is C(n-2,1). Not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the example with four points. The only bad parabola was the one connecting P2 and P4, which passed through P3. In general, if we arrange the points in a concave chain, then the parabolas connecting non-consecutive points might pass through other points, making them bad. But in our example, most parabolas were good.Wait, actually, in the concave arrangement, the parabolas through non-consecutive points are still good because the other points are below them. The only bad parabola was the one that connected P2 and P4, which had P3 lying on it. But in reality, if three points are colinear on a parabola, but since the parabola is determined by two points with leading coefficient 1, having a third point on it requires specific conditions.Wait, but in our example, P2=(-1, -1), P3=(1, -1), P4=(2, -4). The parabola through P2 and P4 is y =x² -2x, which passes through (1, -1). So, in this case, three points lie on the same parabola. But how is that possible? Because a quadratic is defined by three coefficients, so three points can define a unique quadratic. However, in our problem, each parabola is defined with a leading coefficient of 1. So, given two points, we can solve for the remaining coefficients. If a third point lies on it, that&#39;s a special case.Therefore, if we arrange three points such that they lie on a parabola with leading coefficient 1, then the parabola through any two of them will include the third. But in our concave example, we inadvertently placed P2, P3, P4 on the parabola y =x² -2x. Therefore, to avoid this, we need to ensure that no three points lie on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1.Therefore, if we can arrange the points such that no three are on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1, then each parabola through two points will not contain any other points, and as long as all other points are below the parabola, it will be good.Therefore, the maximum number of good parabolas would be C(n,2), provided that all parabolas are good. But this is only possible if all other points are below each parabola, which is highly unlikely unless the points are arranged in a very specific way.But in our n=4 example, five out of six parabolas were good. The only bad one was due to three points lying on the same parabola. If we adjust the points slightly to prevent this, maybe all six parabolas can be good.Let me try modifying the previous example slightly. Let’s take P1=(-2, -4), P2=(-1, -1), P3=(1, -1.1), P4=(2, -4). So, P3 is slightly lower than before.Now, check the parabola through P2 and P4.Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-1, -1): -1=1 -b +c.Plugging in (2, -4): -4=4 +2b +c.Subtract equations: -3=3 +3b =&gt; -6=3b =&gt;b=-2. Then, c=-1 -1 +2=0.Equation:y =x² -2x.At x=1, y=1 -2=-1.1. Wait, P3 is at (1, -1.1). So, the parabola at x=1 is y=-1, which is above P3. Therefore, P3 is below the parabola. Therefore, the parabola through P2 and P4 is good.Thus, in this modified arrangement, all six parabolas are good.Wait, really?Let&#39;s verify:1. Parabola through P1 and P2: y =x² +6x +4. At x=1: 1 +6 +4=11 &gt; -1.1; at x=2:4 +12 +4=20 &gt; -4. Good.2. Parabola through P1 and P3: Compute.P1=(-2, -4), P3=(1, -1.1).Equation:y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in (-2, -4):-4=4 -2b +c.Plugging in (1, -1.1):-1.1=1 +b +c.Subtract: -4 -(-1.1) = (4 -2b +c) - (1 +b +c) =&gt; -2.9=3 -3b =&gt; -5.9=-3b =&gt;b≈1.9667.Then, c≈-1.1 -1 -1.9667≈-4.0667.Equation:y≈x² +1.9667x -4.0667.Check other points:At x=-1 (P2): y≈1 -1.9667 -4.0667≈-5.0334 &lt; -1. Good.At x=2 (P4): y≈4 +3.9334 -4.0667≈3.8667 &gt; -4. Good.So, parabola through P1 and P3 is good.3. Parabola through P1 and P4: y=x² -8. At x=-1:1 -8=-7 &lt; -1; at x=1:1 -8=-7 &lt; -1.1. Good.4. Parabola through P2 and P3:y=x² -x -3. At x=-2:4 +2 -3=3 &gt; -4; at x=2:4 -2 -3=-1 &gt; -4. Good.5. Parabola through P2 and P4:y=x² -2x. At x=1:1 -2=-1 &gt; -1.1. Good.6. Parabola through P3 and P4:y=x² -6x +4. At x=-2:4 +12 +4=20 &gt; -4; at x=-1:1 +6 +4=11 &gt; -1. Good.Thus, all six parabolas are good. Therefore, for n=4, it&#39;s possible to have all C(4,2)=6 parabolas good.But this contradicts the previous idea that the maximum is n-1. So, what&#39;s going on here?The key difference is in the arrangement of the points. If we can arrange the points in such a way that every parabola through any two points lies above all other points, then all parabolas are good. But how is this possible?In this specific case, the points are arranged in a concave manner, with the y-values dipping in the middle and rising at the ends. By adjusting the y-coordinates appropriately, we can ensure that every parabola through any two points is above the other points. This seems counterintuitive, but the example shows it&#39;s possible.Therefore, the maximum number of good parabolas could potentially be C(n,2), which is the total number of parabolas. However, this requires a very specific arrangement of points.But is this always possible for any n? Can we arrange n points with distinct x-coordinates such that every parabola through any two points lies above all other points?This seems challenging. For example, consider five points. If we try to extend the previous concave arrangement, adding another point further out with a lower y-coordinate, we might run into issues where parabolas through non-consecutive points dip below other points.Alternatively, perhaps by making the points&#39; y-coordinates decrease rapidly enough as we move away from the center, we can ensure that all parabolas stay above other points.Let’s attempt a general approach. Suppose we have points P1, P2, ..., Pn with x-coordinates x1 &lt; x2 &lt; ... &lt; xn and y-coordinates y1, y2, ..., yn. We want for every i &lt; j, the parabola through Pi and Pj has yk &lt; parabola(xk) for all k ≠ i, j.To achieve this, the y-coordinates of the points must be chosen such that for any i &lt; j, the quadratic function determined by Pi and Pj is greater than yk at xk for all k ≠ i, j.How can we choose such y-coordinates?Let’s consider the following approach: assign to each point Pi a very negative y-coordinate, except for two points which have higher y-coordinates. However, this might not work because the parabola through two points with high y-coordinates might dip below other points with very negative y-coordinates.Alternatively, assign y-coordinates such that for any two points Pi and Pj, the parabola through them is minimized at some x outside the range of all x-coordinates of the other points. Since parabolas open upwards, their minimum is at the vertex. If the vertex is far to the left or right of all other points, then the parabola would be increasing or decreasing over the range of the other points.Wait, but the vertex of the parabola through Pi and Pj is at x = -b/2, where b is the linear coefficient. Since the parabola is determined by Pi and Pj, the position of the vertex depends on their coordinates.Alternatively, if we can arrange that for any two points Pi and Pj, the parabola through them has its vertex far away from the other points, such that over the x-coordinates of the other points, the parabola is sufficiently high.This is similar to arranging points such that the parabolas through any two have a high enough curvature to stay above other points.But I&#39;m not sure how to formalize this. Maybe using a function where the y-coordinates decay exponentially or quadratically as we move away from a central point.Alternatively, consider setting the y-coordinate of each point to be sufficiently low such that any parabola through two points is above the others. For example, set each y-coordinate as y_i = -x_i² - M, where M is a large positive number. Then, the parabola through any two points Pi and Pj would be y =x² +bx +c. Since y_i = -x_i² - M, plugging into the parabola:-y_i =x_i² +bx_i +c =&gt; -(-x_i² - M) =x_i² +bx_i +c =&gt; x_i² + M =x_i² +bx_i +c =&gt; M =bx_i +c.Similarly for j: M =bx_j +c.Therefore, solving these two equations:bx_i +c = Mbx_j +c = MSubtracting: b(x_i -x_j)=0 =&gt;b=0 (since x_i ≠x_j). Then c=M.Therefore, the parabola is y =x² + M.At any other x_k, y_k = -x_k² - M. The parabola at x_k is x_k² + M. Since x_k² + M &gt; -x_k² - M for all M &gt; -x_k² - x_k² /2. Wait, but if M is large, then x_k² + M is large positive, while y_k is -x_k² - M, which is large negative. Therefore, x_k² + M &gt; y_k for any M. Thus, the parabola y=x² + M is always above all other points. Therefore, if we set y_i = -x_i² - M for all i, then the parabola through any two points is y =x² + M, which is above all other points.But in this case, all parabolas through any two points are the same parabola y=x² + M. But wait, each pair of points defines a unique parabola. However, if we set y_i = -x_i² - M, then the system of equations for each pair leads to the same parabola y=x² + M. Therefore, all parabolas are the same, which is impossible unless all points lie on this parabola. But we set y_i = -x_i² - M, which is different from y=x² + M. Therefore, this is only possible if for each pair of points, the resulting parabola is y=x² + M, which would require that for any two points (x_i, -x_i² - M) and (x_j, -x_j² - M), the parabola y=x² + M passes through them. But:For the parabola y=x² + M to pass through (x_i, -x_i² - M), we must have:-x_i² - M =x_i² + M =&gt; -2x_i² - 2M =0, which implies x_i=0 and M=0. But this contradicts the distinct x-coordinates and M being large.Therefore, this approach is invalid.Alternative idea: Choose y-coordinates such that for any two points, the parabola through them is sufficiently &quot;steep&quot; or &quot;curved&quot; to stay above other points.But parabolas have fixed leading coefficient 1, so their curvature is fixed. The shape depends on the linear and constant terms.Wait, since the leading coefficient is 1, all parabolas open upwards with the same width. Therefore, the only variation is in their vertex positions.To ensure that the parabola through Pi and Pj has all other points below it, we need that for every other point Pk, y_k &lt; x_k² + b x_k + c, where b and c are determined by Pi and Pj.But how can we ensure this for all pairs?Perhaps by choosing the y-coordinates such that for each point Pk, y_k is significantly lower than the minimum possible value of any parabola through two other points at x_k.The minimum value of a parabola y=x² +bx +c is at x = -b/2, and the minimum y-value is c - b²/4.If we can ensure that for any pair Pi and Pj, the minimum value of their parabola is greater than the y-coordinate of every other point at their respective x-coordinates.But this is a bit vague. Let&#39;s try with specific y-coordinates.Let’s define y_i = -K for all i, where K is a large positive constant. Then, any parabola through two points (x_i, -K) and (x_j, -K) would have equation y =x² +bx +c.Plugging in the two points:-K =x_i² +b x_i +c-K =x_j² +b x_j +cSubtract: 0 = (x_j² -x_i²) +b(x_j -x_i)0 = (x_j -x_i)(x_j +x_i +b)Since x_j ≠x_i, we have x_j +x_i +b=0 =&gt;b= - (x_i +x_j)Then, substitute back to find c:-K =x_i² - (x_i +x_j)x_i +c =&gt; -K =x_i² -x_i² -x_i x_j +c =&gt; c= -K +x_i x_j.Therefore, the parabola is y =x² - (x_i +x_j)x + (x_i x_j - K).This simplifies to y =x² - (x_i +x_j)x +x_i x_j - K = (x -x_i)(x -x_j) - K.So, at any other x_k, the value is (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) - K.Since (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) is the product of differences. Depending on whether x_k is between x_i and x_j or outside, this product can be positive or negative.But if K is very large, then (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) - K would be negative, hence y_k = -K &lt; (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) - K. Wait, no. Wait, if y_k is set to -K, then we need:y_k &lt; parabola(x_k) =&gt; -K &lt; (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) - K =&gt; 0 &lt; (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j).But (x_k -x_i)(x_k -x_j) is positive if x_k is outside the interval [x_i,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. So, we have n points on a plane, each with distinct x-coordinates. For each pair of points, we draw a parabola that&#39;s a quadratic trinomial with leading coefficient 1. A parabola is &quot;good&quot; if there are no other marked points on it or above it, except for the two points it&#39;s drawn through. We need to find the maximum number of good parabolas possible.First, let me make sure I understand the setup. We have n points, all with different x-coordinates. So, no two points share the same x-value. Then, between every pair of points, we draw a parabola (which opens upwards because the leading coefficient is 1). A &quot;good&quot; parabola is one where, aside from the two points it passes through, there are no other points from our set lying on or above the parabola.So, the question is asking for the maximum possible number of these good parabolas. That is, what&#39;s the largest number of such parabolas we can have where each parabola doesn&#39;t have any points above it or on it, except the two it&#39;s defined by. And we need to figure out what the maximum number is, given n points with distinct x-coordinates.Hmm. Let me start by considering small values of n and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture.Let&#39;s start with n=2. If there are only two points, then there&#39;s just one parabola connecting them. Since there are no other points, this parabola is automatically good. So for n=2, the answer is 1.Now, n=3. We have three points, each with distinct x-coordinates. Let&#39;s call them A, B, C, ordered from left to right by their x-coordinates. So, A is the leftmost, B is in the middle, C is the rightmost.Each pair of points defines a parabola. So, we have three parabolas: AB, AC, and BC. We need to determine which of these can be good.First, let&#39;s consider the parabola AB. Since it connects A and B, we need to check if point C is on or above this parabola. Similarly, for parabola BC, check if point A is on or above it. For parabola AC, check if point B is on or above it.But since all parabolas open upwards, the shape is U-shaped. So, the parabola connecting A and B will have its vertex somewhere between A and B (assuming they are not vertically aligned, which they can&#39;t be since all x-coordinates are distinct). The same goes for BC. The parabola AC connects the leftmost and rightmost points.Now, for parabola AC. Since it&#39;s connecting the two outermost points, the vertex of this parabola will be somewhere between A and C. Depending on the y-coordinates of the points, the vertex could be lower or higher. But point B is in between A and C in terms of x-coordinate. So, if the parabola AC is such that point B is below it, then parabola AC is good. If point B is on or above parabola AC, then AC is not good.Similarly, for parabola AB, we need to check if point C is above or on it. Since parabola AB is defined by points A and B, which are to the left of C, and since the parabola opens upwards, the right side of the parabola (to the right of B) will increase. So, depending on the position of C relative to AB, point C could be above or below the parabola AB.Same logic applies to parabola BC and point A.So, for n=3, depending on the configuration of points, some parabolas can be good. But the maximum number of good parabolas would depend on how we arrange the points.Wait, but the problem is asking for the maximum number of good parabolas that could result. So, we need to arrange the n points (with distinct x-coordinates) such that as many parabolas as possible are good. So, we can choose the positions of the points (as long as their x-coordinates are distinct) to maximize the number of good parabolas.Therefore, for n=3, perhaps we can arrange the three points such that all three parabolas are good? Let&#39;s see.Suppose we arrange the points such that each middle point is high enough so that when we draw a parabola between two adjacent points, the third point is not above it. Wait, but if we make the middle point very high, then the parabola connecting the two outer points might dip below the middle point. Hmm.Alternatively, if we arrange the points in a convex position? Wait, but these are parabolas, not lines.Wait, let&#39;s think with coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C. Let me set A at (x1, y1), B at (x2, y2), and C at (x3, y3), with x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3.Suppose we set A at (0,0), B at (1, b), and C at (2,0). Then, the parabola AC is y = (x - 0)(x - 2) + 0, but wait, the leading coefficient is 1. So, the general form is y = x² + bx + c. To pass through A(0,0) and C(2,0), we have:At x=0: 0 = 0 + 0 + c =&gt; c=0.At x=2: 0 = 4 + 2b + 0 =&gt; 2b = -4 =&gt; b = -2.So the parabola AC is y = x² - 2x. Now, let&#39;s check the value at x=1 (point B). y = 1 - 2 = -1. So, if point B is at (1, b), then to be above the parabola AC, b must be greater than -1. If we set B at (1, 0), then the parabola AB is another parabola. Wait, but if B is at (1,0), then parabola AB is passing through (0,0) and (1,0). So, parabola AB is y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (1,0): 0 = 1 + b =&gt; b = -1. So parabola AB is y = x² - x. Similarly, parabola BC is y = x² - 3x + 2. Let&#39;s check if these parabolas are good.For parabola AB: y = x² - x. The other points are B and C. But point C is (2,0). Let&#39;s check if C is above or on parabola AB. At x=2, y_AB = 4 - 2 = 2. So point C is at (2,0), which is below the parabola AB (which is at y=2 there). So parabola AB has point C below it. Therefore, parabola AB is good because there are no points above it except A and B.Similarly, parabola BC: y = x² - 3x + 2. At x=0 (point A), y_BC = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2. Point A is at (0,0), which is below the parabola BC. So parabola BC is also good.Parabola AC: y = x² - 2x. At x=1 (point B), y_AC = 1 - 2 = -1. But point B is at (1,0), which is above the parabola AC. Therefore, parabola AC is not good because there&#39;s a point (B) above it. So in this configuration, only two parabolas are good: AB and BC.Alternatively, if we set point B lower. Suppose point B is at (1, -1). Then parabola AC is still y = x² - 2x. At x=1, parabola AC is at y=-1, which is the same as point B. Then, point B is on the parabola AC, so parabola AC is not good. Parabola AB would be y = x² - 2x (since passing through (0,0) and (1,-1)). Let&#39;s check: at x=0, y=0. At x=1, y=1 + b + c = -1. Since leading coefficient is 1, equation is y = x² + bx + c. Plugging (0,0): c=0. Then (1, -1): 1 + b = -1 =&gt; b = -2. So parabola AB is y = x² - 2x. Then at x=2, this parabola would be y=4 - 4 = 0, which is point C. So parabola AB actually passes through C as well? Wait, but we have only three points: A, B, C. But parabola AB is passing through A and B, but if in this case it also passes through C, that would mean all three points lie on the same parabola, but the problem states that the points have distinct abscissas (x-coordinates) but says nothing about the y-coordinates. Wait, but if three points lie on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1, then that&#39;s possible, but in this case, points A(0,0), B(1,-1), C(2,0) lie on parabola y = x² - 2x. Therefore, in this case, all three parabolas AB, BC, and AC coincide with the same parabola? Wait, no. Wait, parabola AB is the same as parabola AC in this case? Wait, no. Wait, if all three points lie on the same parabola, then any pair of them would define the same parabola. So in this case, all three parabolas AB, BC, AC are actually the same parabola. But the problem says through each pair of points, a parabola is drawn. So if three points are colinear on a parabola, then each pair would just give the same parabola. But in this case, since all three points are on the same parabola, then all the three parabolas (for each pair) are the same. However, the problem says &quot;through each pair of points, a parabola [...] is drawn&quot;. So maybe each pair is considered, even if multiple pairs lie on the same parabola. But in this case, since all three pairs lie on the same parabola, then there is only one unique parabola, but three pairs. But since the parabola is drawn through each pair, but all three pairs result in the same parabola. So in this case, how many parabolas are there? There&#39;s just one parabola, but it&#39;s drawn three times? But maybe in the problem&#39;s context, each pair corresponds to a parabola, even if they are the same. But the problem is about counting the number of good parabolas. So if a single parabola is drawn through three pairs, but since all those pairs are on the same parabola, but the problem counts each pair&#39;s parabola separately. Wait, the problem says &quot;through each pair of points, a parabola [...] is drawn&quot;. So each pair corresponds to a parabola. But if multiple pairs lie on the same parabola, then those would be different parabolas? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says &quot;a parabola, the graph of a quadratic trinomial with a leading coefficient of one, is drawn&quot;. So each pair defines a unique parabola, since given two points, there is exactly one quadratic trinomial with leading coefficient 1 passing through those two points. Because a quadratic trinomial is determined by three coefficients, but we fix the leading coefficient to 1, so we have two remaining coefficients. Given two points, we can set up two equations to solve for the remaining coefficients. Therefore, each pair of points defines exactly one parabola (since the leading coefficient is fixed), so each pair gives a unique parabola, even if three points lie on the same parabola.Wait, actually, three points can lie on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1. For example, the points (0,0), (1,-1), (2,0) lie on y = x² - 2x. So in that case, the parabola through (0,0) and (1,-1) is the same as the parabola through (1,-1) and (2,0), and same for (0,0) and (2,0). So in this case, all three pairs result in the same parabola. Therefore, the number of parabolas drawn is not necessarily C(n,2), because different pairs could result in the same parabola. However, the problem says &quot;through each pair of points, a parabola [...] is drawn&quot;. So it seems that even if multiple pairs result in the same parabola, each pair is still associated with that parabola. But when considering the number of good parabolas, are we counting the number of pairs for which the corresponding parabola is good, or the number of distinct parabolas that are good?Wait, the problem says &quot;a parabola is called good if there are no marked points on it or above it, except for the two points through which it is drawn&quot;. So the definition is per parabola, not per pair. So if the same parabola is drawn through multiple pairs, and if that parabola is good, then all those pairs would correspond to a good parabola. However, if a parabola has more than two points on it, then it cannot be good, because the definition requires that only the two points through which it is drawn are on or above it. Wait, actually, the problem says &quot;no marked points on it or above it, except for the two points through which it is drawn&quot;. So if a parabola has three points on it, then even though those three points are on the parabola, for any pair, the parabola would have a third point on it, which violates the &quot;good&quot; condition. Therefore, in order for a parabola to be good, it must pass through exactly two points, and no other points can lie on or above it.Therefore, if three points lie on the same parabola, then any parabola drawn through a pair of those points would actually have the third point on it, making it not good. Therefore, in such a case, none of the parabolas would be good, which is bad for maximizing the number of good parabolas.Therefore, to maximize the number of good parabolas, we need to ensure that no three points lie on the same parabola with leading coefficient 1. Because otherwise, those parabolas would have an extra point on them, making them not good.Therefore, to avoid this, we need our set of points to be in general position with respect to parabolas with leading coefficient 1, meaning no three points lie on the same such parabola. That way, each parabola drawn through a pair of points only contains those two points, and we just have to ensure that no other points lie above them.So, given that, for n=3, if we arrange three points such that none of them lie on the same parabola (with leading coefficient 1) as another pair, then each parabola is defined by exactly two points, and we need to check if the third point is above or below each parabola.In the previous example where points were A(0,0), B(1,0), C(2,0), all on the x-axis, the parabolas would have to pass through these points. Let&#39;s see:Parabola through A(0,0) and B(1,0): leading coefficient 1, so y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (1,0): 1 + b = 0 =&gt; b = -1. So parabola is y = x² - x. Now, check where point C(2,0) is relative to this parabola. At x=2, parabola is y=4 - 2 = 2. So point C is at y=0, which is below the parabola. Therefore, parabola AB is good.Similarly, parabola BC: through B(1,0) and C(2,0). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in B: 1 + b + c = 0. Plugging in C: 4 + 2b + c = 0. Subtract equations: 3 + b = 0 =&gt; b = -3. Then c = -1 - b = -1 - (-3) = 2. So parabola BC is y = x² - 3x + 2. At x=0 (point A), y=0 - 0 + 2 = 2, which is above point A(0,0). Therefore, parabola BC is good because point A is below it.Parabola AC: through A(0,0) and C(2,0). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in A: c=0. Plugging in C: 4 + 2b = 0 =&gt; b = -2. So parabola AC is y = x² - 2x. At x=1 (point B), y=1 - 2 = -1. Since point B is at (1,0), which is above the parabola AC. Therefore, parabola AC is not good.Therefore, in this configuration, two parabolas are good. If we instead arrange the points such that all three parabolas are good, is that possible?Suppose we place the three points in such a way that each parabola doesn&#39;t have the third point above it. Let&#39;s try.Let me take points A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,0). So similar to the first example, but with B raised up.Compute parabola AB: leading coefficient 1. So y = x² + bx + c. Through (0,0): c=0. Through (1,1): 1 + b = 1 =&gt; b=0. So parabola AB is y = x². At point C(2,0), y=4, which is above point C. Wait, but parabola AB is y=x², so at x=2, y=4. Point C is at (2,0), which is below. Therefore, parabola AB is good.Parabola BC: through (1,1) and (2,0). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (1,1): 1 + b + c = 1. Plugging in (2,0): 4 + 2b + c = 0. Subtract the first equation from the second: 3 + b = -1 =&gt; b = -4. Then c = 1 -1 - b = 0 - (-4) = 4? Wait:Wait, first equation: 1 + b + c = 1 =&gt; b + c = 0.Second equation: 4 + 2b + c = 0.Subtract first equation from second: (4 + 2b + c) - (1 + b + c) = 3 + b = -1 =&gt; b = -4.Then from b + c = 0 =&gt; c = 4.So parabola BC is y = x² -4x +4 = (x - 2)^2. At x=0 (point A), y = 4, which is above point A(0,0). So parabola BC is good.Parabola AC: through (0,0) and (2,0). As before, y = x² - 2x. At x=1, y= -1. Point B is at (1,1), which is above the parabola AC. Therefore, parabola AC is not good.So again, only two parabolas are good. Is there a way to arrange three points so that all three parabolas are good?Suppose we try to place the middle point very low. Let&#39;s say A(0,0), B(1,-1), C(2,0).Parabola AB: through (0,0) and (1,-1). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (1,-1): 1 + b = -1 =&gt; b = -2. So parabola AB is y = x² - 2x. At x=2, y = 4 - 4 = 0, which is point C. So parabola AB passes through C as well. Therefore, parabola AB has three points on it: A, B, and C. Therefore, parabola AB is not good because when considering parabola AB (drawn through A and B), point C is on it. Similarly, parabola BC (drawn through B and C) also passes through A, and parabola AC (drawn through A and C) also passes through B. So all three parabolas are the same parabola, which has all three points on it. Therefore, none of the parabolas are good because each has a third point on it. So that&#39;s worse.Alternatively, what if we arrange the three points such that each parabola&#39;s vertex is below the other point? Wait, but with parabolas opening upwards, the vertex is the minimum point. So if the third point is above the vertex, but maybe not above the entire parabola.Wait, for parabola AB connecting points A and B, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Since leading coefficient is 1, vertex is at x = -b/2. From the equation y = x² + bx + c. If we know the parabola passes through A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2), we can find the vertex.But this might be getting too algebraic. Maybe a geometric approach is better.Alternatively, let&#39;s think in terms of convex hulls. Since all parabolas open upwards, the region above a parabola is convex. So, if we arrange the points in a &quot;convex&quot; position with respect to these parabolas, maybe we can maximize the number of good parabolas.Wait, but convex hull for parabolas is not the same as for lines. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe arranging the points in such a way that each subsequent point is sufficiently high above the previous parabolas. Wait, but how?Alternatively, maybe arranging all the points in a way that they form a convex function. If the points are arranged such that their y-values form a convex function (i.e., the second difference is positive), then maybe the parabolas connecting adjacent points lie below the other points.Wait, let&#39;s think. Suppose the points are arranged in a convex upward fashion, like a V-shape. For example, points go up, then down. Wait, but a convex function would be U-shaped.Wait, for a function to be convex, the line segment between any two points lies above the function. But here, we have parabolas, which are themselves convex functions. So if our set of points is such that the piecewise linear curve connecting them is convex, then perhaps the parabolas between adjacent points lie below the other points.But I&#39;m not sure. Let me take an example.Suppose we have four points arranged in a convex position: leftmost low, next higher, next higher, rightmost low. Like a smile shape. Then, connecting the leftmost and rightmost points with a parabola would create a U-shape, and the middle points are above it. But if we connect adjacent points, their parabolas might lie below the other points.Alternatively, if the points are arranged in a convex upward curve, such that each parabola connecting two adjacent points is below the rest.Wait, this is getting a bit vague. Let&#39;s try with n=3 again.Suppose we have three points forming a convex upward curve: left point, higher middle point, right point lower than the middle but higher than the left. Wait, but with three points, a convex function would have the middle point lower than the line connecting the two outer points. Wait, no. For a convex function, the line segment between any two points lies above the function. So if you have three points, the middle point must lie below the line segment connecting the outer two points. But we&#39;re dealing with parabolas, not lines.But in our case, the parabolas are themselves convex (opening upwards). So if we arrange the three points such that the middle point is above the parabola connecting the outer two points, then that parabola is not good. Conversely, if the middle point is below the parabola connecting the outer two points, then that parabola is good.But to have all three parabolas good, each parabola must have the third point below it.Wait, let&#39;s see. For three points A, B, C, with x1 &lt; x2 &lt; x3.Parabola AB: the third point is C. We need C to be below parabola AB.Parabola BC: the third point is A. We need A to be below parabola BC.Parabola AC: the third point is B. We need B to be below parabola AC.Is it possible to arrange three points such that all three conditions are satisfied?Let me try to assign coordinates.Let’s set A at (0,0), C at (2,0), and B at (1, y). We need to choose y such that:1. B is below parabola AC.Parabola AC is y = x² - 2x (as before). At x=1, this parabola is at y=1 - 2 = -1. So, to have B below parabola AC, we need y &lt; -1.2. C is below parabola AB.Parabola AB passes through (0,0) and (1,y). Equation: y_AB = x² + bx + c.Plugging in (0,0): c=0.Plugging in (1,y): 1 + b = y =&gt; b = y - 1.Thus, parabola AB is y = x² + (y - 1)x.At x=2 (point C), y_AB = 4 + 2(y - 1) = 4 + 2y - 2 = 2 + 2y. Since point C is (2,0), we need 0 &lt; 2 + 2y =&gt; 2 + 2y &gt; 0 =&gt; y &gt; -1.But from condition 1, we need y &lt; -1. Contradiction. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible to have both conditions 1 and 2 satisfied. So in this case, if we set y &lt; -1 to satisfy B below parabola AC, then parabola AB at x=2 would be 2 + 2y, which would be less than 0 since y &lt; -1, which would imply point C is above parabola AB. Therefore, violating the requirement for parabola AB to be good.Similarly, if we set y &gt; -1 to satisfy parabola AB being below point C, then parabola AC would have point B above it, making parabola AC not good.Therefore, for n=3, it&#39;s impossible to have all three parabolas good. The maximum number of good parabolas is 2, as in the earlier examples.Therefore, for n=3, the answer is 2.Moving on to n=4. Let&#39;s see if we can find a pattern.Suppose we have four points with distinct x-coordinates: A, B, C, D from left to right. To maximize the number of good parabolas, we need to arrange the points such that as many parabolas as possible don&#39;t have other points above them.From the n=3 case, we saw that arranging the middle points high allows the adjacent parabolas to be good, but the parabola connecting the outer points is not good because the middle point is above it. Alternatively, arranging the middle points low might cause other issues.Wait, maybe if we arrange the points in a &quot;zig-zag&quot; pattern, alternating high and low, such that each parabola connecting two points doesn&#39;t have other points above it.Alternatively, arrange the points in such a way that all parabolas connecting adjacent points are good, and also some parabolas connecting non-adjacent points.Wait, in the n=3 case, the two good parabolas were the adjacent ones (AB and BC), and the non-adjacent one (AC) was not good. Maybe for n=4, the maximum number of good parabolas is 3? Or perhaps more?Alternatively, if we arrange the four points such that each pair of adjacent points forms a good parabola, and also the parabolas connecting every other point (like AC and BD) are also good. But is that possible?Let&#39;s try to construct such an arrangement.Let me attempt to place four points in a &quot;convex&quot; position with respect to parabolas.Let’s denote the points as A, B, C, D from left to right. Let&#39;s try to set their y-coordinates such that:- The parabola AB is below C and D.- The parabola BC is below A and D.Wait, but since parabolas open upwards, the further away you go from the vertex, the higher the parabola. So, for parabola AB, which connects A and B, the vertex is between A and B. Points to the right of B (C and D) will be to the right of the parabola&#39;s vertex. Since the parabola opens upwards, the further right you go, the higher the parabola. Therefore, if points C and D are placed sufficiently low, they might be below parabola AB. But parabola AB, after point B, is increasing. So, if point C is to the right of B, its y-coordinate must be above the parabola AB at x=C.x, otherwise it&#39;s below. But if we place C very low, maybe it can be below parabola AB.Wait, but parabola AB is determined by points A and B. Let&#39;s assign coordinates.Let’s set A at (0,0), B at (1,0). Then, the parabola AB is y = x² - x (as before). At x=2, this parabola is y=4 - 2 = 2. So, if we place point C at (2,0), it&#39;s below parabola AB. Then parabola BC would connect (1,0) and (2,0). Its equation is y = x² - 3x + 2. At x=0, this parabola is at y=2, which is above point A(0,0). So parabola BC is good. Similarly, parabola AC is y = x² - 2x. At x=1, y=-1, so point B(1,0) is above it, making parabola AC not good.But in this case, parabolas AB and BC are good. What about other parabolas? Parabola BD connects B(1,0) and D(3,0). Wait, but we only have four points: A, B, C, D. Let me correct. Let&#39;s set four points: A(0,0), B(1,0), C(2,0), D(3,0). All on the x-axis. Then, any parabola connecting two points will have the other points below it. Wait, let&#39;s check.Take parabola AB: y = x² - x. At x=2, y=4 - 2 = 2. Points C(2,0) and D(3,0) are below it. So parabola AB is good.Parabola AC: connects A(0,0) and C(2,0). Equation y = x² - 2x. At x=1, y=-1. Point B(1,0) is above it, so parabola AC is not good.Parabola AD: connects A(0,0) and D(3,0). Equation y = x² - 3x. At x=1, y=1 - 3 = -2. Points B and C are above it (they are at y=0). So parabola AD has points B and C above it, so it&#39;s not good.Similarly, parabola BC: connects B(1,0) and C(2,0). Equation y = x² - 3x + 2. At x=0, y=2. Point A(0,0) is below it. At x=3, y=9 - 9 + 2 = 2. Point D(3,0) is below it. So parabola BC is good.Parabola BD: connects B(1,0) and D(3,0). Equation y = x² -4x + 3. At x=2, y=4 -8 + 3 = -1. Point C(2,0) is above it, so parabola BD is not good.Parabola CD: connects C(2,0) and D(3,0). Equation y = x² -5x + 6. At x=1, y=1 -5 +6 = 2. Points A and B are below it. So parabola CD is good.Therefore, in this configuration, the good parabolas are AB, BC, CD (the adjacent ones), and also BD is not good, AC is not good, AD is not good. Wait, BD is not good because of point C. So in this case, only three good parabolas: AB, BC, CD.But wait, let me check parabola BD: connects B(1,0) and D(3,0). At x=2, the parabola BD is at y=-1, which is below point C(2,0). Wait, point C is at (2,0), which is above the parabola BD at x=2. Therefore, parabola BD is not good because there&#39;s a point (C) above it. So in this case, only the adjacent parabolas are good. So three good parabolas for n=4.But maybe there&#39;s a way to arrange four points such that more parabolas are good.Suppose we arrange the four points in a &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern, alternating high and low. For example, A(0,0), B(1,h), C(2,0), D(3,h), with h &gt; 0. Let&#39;s see.First, parabola AB: connects (0,0) and (1,h). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (1,h): 1 + b = h =&gt; b = h -1. So parabola AB is y = x² + (h -1)x.Now, check other points:At x=2 (point C), y = 4 + 2(h -1) = 4 + 2h - 2 = 2 + 2h. Since point C is (2,0), we need 0 &lt; 2 + 2h, which is always true since h &gt; 0. So point C is below parabola AB. Similarly, at x=3 (point D), y = 9 + 3(h -1) = 9 + 3h - 3 = 6 + 3h. Point D is at (3,h). So we need h &lt; 6 + 3h =&gt; 0 &lt; 6 + 2h, which is true. Therefore, parabola AB is good.Parabola BC: connects (1,h) and (2,0). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (1,h): 1 + b + c = h. Plugging in (2,0): 4 + 2b + c = 0. Subtracting first equation from second: 3 + b = -h =&gt; b = -h -3. Then from first equation: c = h -1 -b = h -1 - (-h -3) = h -1 + h +3 = 2h + 2. So parabola BC is y = x² + (-h -3)x + 2h + 2.Now, check points A(0,0) and D(3,h):At x=0: y = 0 + 0 + 2h + 2 = 2h + 2. Point A is at (0,0), which is below the parabola BC if 0 &lt; 2h + 2, which is true since h &gt; 0. So parabola BC is good with respect to point A.At x=3: y = 9 + (-h -3)*3 + 2h + 2 = 9 -3h -9 + 2h + 2 = (-h) + 2. Point D is at (3,h). So we need h &lt; (-h) + 2 =&gt; 2h &lt; 2 =&gt; h &lt; 1.Therefore, if h &lt; 1, then parabola BC is good (point D is below it). If h &gt;=1, then parabola BC is not good.Similarly, parabola CD: connects (2,0) and (3,h). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (2,0): 4 + 2b + c = 0. Plugging in (3,h): 9 + 3b + c = h. Subtract first equation from second: 5 + b = h =&gt; b = h -5. Then from first equation: c = -4 -2b = -4 -2(h -5) = -4 -2h +10 = 6 -2h. So parabola CD is y = x² + (h -5)x + 6 -2h.Check other points:At x=1 (point B): y = 1 + (h -5) + 6 -2h = 1 + h -5 +6 -2h = (1 -5 +6) + (h -2h) = 2 - h. Point B is at (1,h). So we need h &lt; 2 - h =&gt; 2h &lt; 2 =&gt; h &lt; 1.At x=0 (point A): y = 0 + 0 + 6 -2h = 6 -2h. Point A is at (0,0). So 0 &lt; 6 -2h =&gt; h &lt; 3.Therefore, parabola CD is good with respect to point A if h &lt; 3, and good with respect to point B if h &lt; 1.Parabola AD: connects (0,0) and (3,h). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (3,h): 9 + 3b = h =&gt; b = (h -9)/3. So parabola AD is y = x² + ((h -9)/3)x.Check other points:At x=1 (point B): y = 1 + (h -9)/3 = (3 + h -9)/3 = (h -6)/3. Point B is at (1,h). So we need h &lt; (h -6)/3 =&gt; 3h &lt; h -6 =&gt; 2h &lt; -6 =&gt; h &lt; -3. But h &gt; 0, so impossible. Therefore, parabola AD is not good because point B is above it.At x=2 (point C): y = 4 + ((h -9)/3)*2 = 4 + (2h -18)/3 = 4 + (2h/3 -6) = (2h/3 -2). Point C is at (2,0). So 0 &lt; 2h/3 -2 =&gt; 2h/3 &gt; 2 =&gt; h &gt;3. But if h &lt;1 for parabola BC and CD to be good, then this is not possible. So parabola AD is not good in this range.Parabola AC: connects (0,0) and (2,0). Equation y = x² -2x. At x=1, y = -1. Point B is at (1,h). Since h &gt;0, point B is above parabola AC. So parabola AC is not good.Parabola BD: connects (1,h) and (3,h). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (1,h): 1 + b + c = h. Plugging in (3,h): 9 + 3b + c = h. Subtract first equation from second: 8 + 2b = 0 =&gt; b = -4. Then c = h -1 -b = h -1 +4 = h +3. So parabola BD is y = x² -4x + h +3.Check other points:At x=0 (point A): y = 0 -0 + h +3 = h +3. Point A is at (0,0), which is below.At x=2 (point C): y =4 -8 + h +3 = h -1. Point C is at (2,0). So we need 0 &lt; h -1 =&gt; h &gt;1. But earlier, for parabolas BC and CD to be good, we needed h &lt;1. Therefore, if h &gt;1, parabola BD is good with respect to point C, but then parabolas BC and CD are not good. If h &lt;1, parabola BD is not good because point C is above it.Therefore, in this configuration, if we choose h &lt;1, then parabolas AB, BC, CD are good, and parabola BD is not. Also, parabola BD could be good if h &gt;1, but then other parabolas fail. So with h &lt;1, we have three good parabolas: AB, BC, CD.But maybe there are other parabolas that can be good. For example, parabola BD might be good if h is chosen appropriately. Wait, but with h &lt;1, parabola BD at x=2 is h -1, which is negative, so point C(2,0) is above it. So parabola BD is not good. Parabola AC is not good. Parabola AD is not good. So total three good parabolas.Is there a way to have more than three good parabolas for n=4?Suppose we arrange the four points in a convex-up position, such that each non-adjacent parabola lies below the other points. For example, place points A, B, C, D in a U-shape, with A and D at the bottom, B and C higher up. Let&#39;s see.Let’s assign coordinates: A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,1), D(3,0). So it&#39;s a U-shape.Parabola AB: connects (0,0) and (1,1). Equation y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in (0,0): c=0. Plugging in (1,1): 1 + b =1 =&gt; b=0. So parabola AB is y = x². At x=2, y=4. Point C(2,1) is below it. At x=3, y=9. Point D(3,0) is below it. So parabola AB is good.Parabola BC: connects (1,1) and (2,1). Since they have the same y-coordinate, the parabola would be y = x² + bx + c. Plugging in both points:At x=1: 1 + b + c =1 =&gt; b + c =0.At x=2:4 + 2b + c =1 =&gt; 2b + c = -3.Subtract first equation: 2b + c - (b + c) = -3 -0 =&gt; b = -3.Then c =3.So parabola BC is y =x² -3x +3. At x=0: y=0 -0 +3=3. Point A(0,0) is below. At x=3: y=9 -9 +3=3. Point D(3,0) is below. So parabola BC is good.Parabola CD: connects (2,1) and (3,0). Equation y =x² + bx + c. Plugging in (2,1):4 +2b +c=1. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract first equation:5 +b= -1 =&gt; b= -6. Then c=1 -4 -2b=1 -4 -2*(-6)=1 -4 +12=9. So parabola CD is y=x² -6x +9 = (x-3)^2. At x=1: y=1 -6 +9=4. Point B(1,1) is below. At x=0: y=9. Point A is below. So parabola CD is good.Parabola AD: connects (0,0) and (3,0). Equation y=x² -3x. At x=1: y=1 -3= -2. Point B(1,1) is above it. So parabola AD is not good.Parabola AC: connects (0,0) and (2,1). Equation y=x² + bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (2,1):4 +2b=1 =&gt; 2b= -3 =&gt;b= -3/2. So parabola AC is y=x² - (3/2)x. At x=1: y=1 - 3/2= -1/2. Point B(1,1) is above. So parabola AC is not good.Parabola BD: connects (1,1) and (3,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,1):1 +b +c=1 =&gt;b +c=0. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract: 8 +2b= -1 =&gt;2b= -9 =&gt;b= -9/2. Then c=9/2. So parabola BD is y=x² - (9/2)x +9/2. At x=0: y=9/2. Point A(0,0) is below. At x=2:4 -9 +9/2=4 -9 +4.5= -0.5. Point C(2,1) is above. So parabola BD is not good.Therefore, in this U-shaped arrangement, we have three good parabolas: AB, BC, CD. Same as before.Is there a way to get more?Suppose we try to make some non-adjacent parabolas good. For example, in the previous U-shape, parabola BD is not good because of point C. What if we raise point C higher?Let me try with A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,2), D(3,0). So a steeper U-shape.Parabola AB: y =x² (same as before). At x=2, y=4, which is above point C(2,2). So parabola AB is good (no points above except A,B).Parabola BC: connects (1,1) and (2,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,1):1 +b +c=1 =&gt;b +c=0. Plugging in (2,2):4 +2b +c=2 =&gt;2b +c= -2. Subtract equations: b= -2. Then c=2. So parabola BC is y=x² -2x +2. At x=0: y=2. Point A is below. At x=3:y=9 -6 +2=5. Point D is below. So parabola BC is good.Parabola CD: connects (2,2) and (3,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (2,2):4 +2b +c=2. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract:5 +b= -2 =&gt;b= -7. Then c=2 -4 -2b=2 -4 -2*(-7)=2 -4 +14=12. So parabola CD is y=x² -7x +12. At x=1: y=1 -7 +12=6. Point B is below. At x=0: y=12. Point A is below. So parabola CD is good.Parabola AD: connects (0,0) and (3,0). Equation y=x² -3x. At x=1: y=1 -3= -2. Point B is above. Not good.Parabola AC: connects (0,0) and (2,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (2,2):4 +2b=2 =&gt;2b= -2 =&gt;b= -1. So parabola AC is y=x² -x. At x=1: y=0. Point B(1,1) is above. Not good.Parabola BD: connects (1,1) and (3,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,1):1 +b +c=1 =&gt;b +c=0. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract:8 +2b= -1 =&gt;2b= -9 =&gt;b= -4.5. Then c=4.5. So parabola BD is y=x² -4.5x +4.5. At x=2: y=4 -9 +4.5= -0.5. Point C(2,2) is above. So parabola BD is not good.So even with a steeper U-shape, we still have three good parabolas. The non-adjacent ones are not good.Alternatively, maybe arranging the points in a different pattern. Let&#39;s try a W-shape: A(0,0), B(1,2), C(2,0), D(3,2).Parabola AB: connects (0,0) and (1,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (1,2):1 +b =2 =&gt;b=1. So parabola AB is y=x² +x. At x=2:y=4 +2=6. Point C(2,0) is below. At x=3:y=9 +3=12. Point D(3,2) is below. So parabola AB is good.Parabola BC: connects (1,2) and (2,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,2):1 +b +c=2. Plugging in (2,0):4 +2b +c=0. Subtract:3 +b= -2 =&gt;b= -5. Then c=2 -1 -b=2 -1 -(-5)=6. So parabola BC is y=x² -5x +6. At x=0:y=6. Point A(0,0) is below. At x=3:y=9 -15 +6=0. Point D(3,2) is above. So parabola BC is not good because point D is above it.Parabola CD: connects (2,0) and (3,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (2,0):4 +2b +c=0. Plugging in (3,2):9 +3b +c=2. Subtract:5 +b=2 =&gt;b= -3. Then c=0 -4 -2b=0 -4 -2*(-3)=0 -4 +6=2. So parabola CD is y=x² -3x +2. At x=1:y=1 -3 +2=0. Point B(1,2) is above. Not good.Parabola AD: connects (0,0) and (3,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (3,2):9 +3b=2 =&gt;3b= -7 =&gt;b= -7/3. So parabola AD is y=x² - (7/3)x. At x=1:y=1 -7/3= -4/3. Point B(1,2) is above. Not good.Parabola AC: connects (0,0) and (2,0). Equation y=x² -2x. At x=1:y= -1. Point B(1,2) is above. Not good.Parabola BD: connects (1,2) and (3,2). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,2):1 +b +c=2 =&gt;b +c=1. Plugging in (3,2):9 +3b +c=2 =&gt;3b +c= -7. Subtract:2b= -8 =&gt;b= -4. Then c=1 -b=5. So parabola BD is y=x² -4x +5. At x=0:y=5. Point A(0,0) is below. At x=2:y=4 -8 +5=1. Point C(2,0) is above. So parabola BD is not good.Therefore, in this W-shape, only parabola AB is good. That&#39;s worse than the U-shape.So maybe the U-shape is better. Let&#39;s try another configuration. Suppose we place the four points in a concave shape: A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,1), D(3,0). Wait, that&#39;s the same as the earlier U-shape. It gave three good parabolas.Alternatively, let&#39;s try placing two inner points low and two outer points high. A(0,3), B(1,0), C(2,0), D(3,3). Let&#39;s check.Parabola AB: connects (0,3) and (1,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,3):c=3. Plugging in (1,0):1 +b +3=0 =&gt;b= -4. So parabola AB is y=x² -4x +3. At x=2:y=4 -8 +3= -1. Point C(2,0) is above. So parabola AB is not good.This might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe arranging the inner points very low.Wait, if I arrange the inner points very low, then parabolas connecting outer points might pass over them, but parabolas connecting adjacent points might be good.Wait, suppose A(0,0), B(1,-h), C(2,-h), D(3,0), with h&gt;0.Parabola AB: connects (0,0) and (1,-h). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (1,-h):1 +b = -h =&gt;b= -h -1. So parabola AB is y=x² - (h +1)x. At x=2:y=4 -2(h +1). Point C(2,-h) must be below this, so -h &lt;4 -2h -2 =&gt; -h &lt;2 -2h =&gt; h &lt;2.At x=3:y=9 -3(h +1). Point D(3,0) must be below this: 0 &lt;9 -3h -3 =&gt;0 &lt;6 -3h =&gt;h &lt;2.So if h &lt;2, points C and D are below parabola AB. So parabola AB is good.Similarly, parabola BC: connects (1,-h) and (2,-h). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,-h):1 +b +c= -h. Plugging in (2,-h):4 +2b +c= -h. Subtract:3 +b=0 =&gt;b= -3. Then c= -h -1 -b= -h -1 +3=2 -h. So parabola BC is y=x² -3x +2 -h.At x=0:y=0 -0 +2 -h=2 -h. Point A(0,0) is below if 0 &lt;2 -h =&gt;h &lt;2. Which holds.At x=3:y=9 -9 +2 -h=2 -h. Point D(3,0) is below if 0 &lt;2 -h =&gt;h &lt;2.So parabola BC is good if h &lt;2.Parabola CD: connects (2,-h) and (3,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (2,-h):4 +2b +c= -h. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract:5 +b= h. Then c= -h -4 -2b= -h -4 -2(h -5)= -h -4 -2h +10= -3h +6. So parabola CD is y=x² + (h -5)x + (-3h +6).Check at x=1:y=1 + (h -5) + (-3h +6)=1 +h -5 -3h +6= (1 -5 +6) + (h -3h)=2 -2h. Point B(1,-h) is below if -h &lt;2 -2h =&gt; -h -2 &lt; -2h =&gt; -2 &lt; -h =&gt;h &lt;2. Which is true.At x=0:y=0 +0 + (-3h +6)=6 -3h. Point A(0,0) is below if 0 &lt;6 -3h =&gt;h &lt;2. True.So parabola CD is good if h &lt;2.Parabola AD: connects (0,0) and (3,0). Equation y=x² -3x. At x=1:y=1 -3= -2. Point B(1,-h) is below if -h &lt; -2 =&gt;h &gt;2. But h &lt;2 in our case, so point B is above the parabola AD. Therefore, parabola AD is not good.Parabola AC: connects (0,0) and (2,-h). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (0,0):c=0. Plugging in (2,-h):4 +2b= -h =&gt;2b= -h -4 =&gt;b= (-h -4)/2. So parabola AC is y=x² + [(-h -4)/2]x.At x=1:y=1 + [(-h -4)/2]*1=1 - (h +4)/2= (2 -h -4)/2= (-h -2)/2. Point B(1,-h) is at y=-h. So we need -h &lt; (-h -2)/2 =&gt; Multiply both sides by 2: -2h &lt; -h -2 =&gt; -2h +h &lt; -2 =&gt; -h &lt; -2 =&gt;h &gt;2. But h &lt;2, so this is false. Therefore, parabola AC has point B above it.Parabola BD: connects (1,-h) and (3,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in (1,-h):1 +b +c= -h. Plugging in (3,0):9 +3b +c=0. Subtract:8 +2b= h. Then c= -h -1 -b= -h -1 - (h -8)/2= (-2h -2 -h +8)/2= (-3h +6)/2. So parabola BD is y=x² + [(h -8)/2]x + (-3h +6)/2.At x=2:y=4 + (h -8) + (-3h +6)/2=4 + h -8 + (-3h/2 +3)= (4 -8 +3) + (h -3h/2)= (-1) + (-h/2). Point C(2,-h) is at y=-h. So we need -h &lt; -1 -h/2 =&gt; -h +h/2 &lt; -1 =&gt; -h/2 &lt; -1 =&gt;h/2 &gt;1 =&gt;h&gt;2. But h &lt;2, so this is false. Therefore, parabola BD is not good.Therefore, in this configuration, with h &lt;2, we have three good parabolas: AB, BC, CD. The same as previous cases.So, regardless of how we arrange four points, the maximum number of good parabolas seems to be three. But wait, in the first example where all four points were on the x-axis, we also had three good parabolas. So, for n=4, the maximum is 3?But wait, that would suggest a pattern of n-1. For n=2, 1; n=3, 2; n=4, 3. So the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1. Is this the case?Wait, let&#39;s check for n=5. If the pattern continues, the maximum number would be 4.But before jumping to conclusions, let&#39;s think.If we can arrange n points in a &quot;chain&quot; where each consecutive pair is connected by a good parabola, and no other points are above these parabolas, then the number of good parabolas would be n-1. For example, in the case where all points are on the x-axis, the parabolas connecting consecutive points are good, and the parabolas connecting non-consecutive points have other points above them.Similarly, in the U-shaped or convex arrangements, the adjacent parabolas are good, and the others are not.Therefore, if this pattern holds, the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.But wait, let&#39;s consider n=4 again. We saw that arranging the four points on the x-axis gave three good parabolas (n-1). Similarly, arranging them in a U-shape also gave three good parabolas. So for n=4, it&#39;s 3. So, if this continues, then the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.But we need to confirm this for another value, say n=5.Suppose we have five points on the x-axis at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). Let&#39;s see which parabolas are good.For any two consecutive points, the parabola connecting them will be good. For example, parabola connecting (0,0) and (1,0) is y =x² -x. At x=2, y=4 -2=2, which is above point (2,0). Wait, but point (2,0) is to the right of the parabola&#39;s vertex. Wait, the parabola connecting (0,0) and (1,0) is y =x² -x. Its vertex is at x=0.5, y=-0.25. Then, as x increases beyond 1, the parabola increases. So at x=2, y=2, which is above point (2,0). So the parabola connecting (0,0) and (1,0) is good, because points (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) are below it.Similarly, the parabola connecting (1,0) and (2,0) is y =x² -3x +2. At x=0, y=2; at x=3, y=2. So points (0,0) and (3,0) are below it.Similarly, the parabola connecting (2,0) and (3,0) is y =x² -5x +6. At x=1, y=2; at x=4, y=2. So points (1,0) and (4,0) are below.The parabola connecting (3,0) and (4,0) is y =x² -7x +12. At x=2, y=2; at x=5, y=2. But we only have five points, so other points are below.Therefore, each consecutive parabola is good. The non-consecutive parabolas, however, will have points above them.For example, parabola connecting (0,0) and (2,0): y =x² -2x. At x=1, y= -1. Point (1,0) is above it.Similarly, parabola connecting (0,0) and (3,0): y =x² -3x. At x=1, y= -2; at x=2, y= -2. Points (1,0) and (2,0) are above.Therefore, in this configuration, we have four good parabolas (n-1=5-1=4). Similarly, for n points on the x-axis, we would have n-1 good parabolas.But is there a configuration where more than n-1 good parabolas are possible?Suppose we arrange the points in a convex-up position (U-shape) such that all consecutive parabolas are good and some non-consecutive ones are also good.For example, take five points in a U-shape: A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,2), D(3,1), E(4,0). Let&#39;s check if any non-consecutive parabolas are good.Parabola AC: connects A(0,0) and C(2,2). Equation y =x² +bx +c. Plugging in A: c=0. Plugging in C:4 +2b =2 =&gt;2b =-2 =&gt;b=-1. So parabola AC is y=x² -x. At x=1:y=0. Point B(1,1) is above. So parabola AC is not good.Parabola BD: connects B(1,1) and D(3,1). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in B:1 +b +c=1 =&gt;b +c=0. Plugging in D:9 +3b +c=1 =&gt;3b +c=-8. Subtract equations:2b= -8 =&gt;b= -4. Then c=4. So parabola BD is y=x² -4x +4. At x=2:y=4 -8 +4=0. Point C(2,2) is above. Not good.Parabola CE: connects C(2,2) and E(4,0). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in C:4 +2b +c=2. Plugging in E:16 +4b +c=0. Subtract:12 +2b= -2 =&gt;2b= -14 =&gt;b= -7. Then c=2 -4 -2b=2 -4 -2*(-7)=2 -4 +14=12. So parabola CE is y=x² -7x +12. At x=3:y=9 -21 +12=0. Point D(3,1) is above. Not good.Similarly, other non-consecutive parabolas will have points above them. Therefore, even in this U-shape, only the consecutive parabolas are good, resulting in n-1 good parabolas.Therefore, it seems that the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.But let&#39;s check another configuration for n=4 where maybe a non-consecutive parabola is good.Suppose we have four points arranged as follows: A(0,3), B(1,1), C(2,1), D(3,3). This is a convex-up shape.Parabola AB: connects (0,3) and (1,1). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in A: c=3. Plugging in B:1 +b +3=1 =&gt;b= -3. So parabola AB is y=x² -3x +3. At x=2:y=4 -6 +3=1. Point C(2,1) is on the parabola. Therefore, parabola AB is not good.Parabola BC: connects (1,1) and (2,1). Equation y=x² +bx +c. Plugging in B:1 +b +c=1 =&gt;b +c=0. Plugging in C:4 +2b +c=1 =&gt;2b +c= -3. Subtract: b= -3. Then c=3. So parabola BC is y=x² -3x +3. At x=0:y=3. Point A(0,3) is on the parabola. Not good.This isn&#39;t helpful. Maybe another arrangement.Suppose we have four points where two parabolas are good in addition to the three adjacent ones. Wait, but how?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that each good parabola corresponds to an edge in a convex polygon. In a convex polygon, the edges are the ones that &quot;see&quot; the outside, and the diagonals are inside. But with parabolas, which are U-shaped, it&#39;s a different story.Alternatively, maybe the maximum number of good parabolas is equivalent to the number of edges in a convex polygon, which is n. But we saw for n=3, it&#39;s 2, which is less than n. So maybe not.Alternatively, think of the problem as similar to the convex hull. In the plane, the convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon containing all the points. The edges of the convex hull are those segments that have all other points on one side. But again, with parabolas, the situation is different.But in our case, a good parabola is one where all other points are below it. So, it&#39;s similar to the concept of a convex hull, but with parabolas instead of lines.In computational geometry, the concept of a convex hull with respect to a parabola might exist, but I&#39;m not familiar with it. However, it&#39;s possible that the maximum number of such parabolas is n-1, similar to the number of edges in a convex polygon.Given that in all examples we tried, the maximum number of good parabolas was n-1, and that arranging points in a convex-up or straight line configuration achieved this, I conjecture that the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.But to verify, let&#39;s think for n=5. If we place five points on a straight line with distinct x-coordinates, say at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), then each consecutive pair defines a good parabola, and the other parabolas are not good. So we would have 4 good parabolas, which is n-1=5-1=4.Similarly, if we arrange them in a U-shape, we still get n-1 good parabolas. Therefore, the pattern holds.Therefore, the maximum number of good parabolas is n-1.But wait, let&#39;s think again. Suppose we have n points arranged such that all consecutive parabolas are good, and some non-consecutive ones as well. For example, in a convex-up arrangement where some non-consecutive parabolas also lie below all other points.But based on earlier examples, it&#39;s difficult to have non-consecutive parabolas be good because the points in between tend to be above or on the parabola. For example, connecting point A and point C with a parabola will have point B in between, which could be above or below depending on the arrangement.But in the straight line case, the parabola connecting A and C would have vertex between A and C, and since it&#39;s a U-shape, points to the right of C would be below the parabola. However, point B is between A and C, and since the parabola opens upward, the minimum is at the vertex. If the y-coordinate of the parabola at B&#39;s x-coordinate is lower than B&#39;s y-coordinate (which is zero in the straight line case), then point B is above the parabola.Therefore, in the straight line case, all non-consecutive parabolas will have points above them, making them not good. Hence, only the consecutive ones are good.Therefore, the maximum number of good parabolas is indeed n-1.Thus, the answer should be boxed{n-1}.Final AnswerThe maximum number of good parabolas is boxed{n-1}.&lt;/think&gt;Given ( n ) points with distinct abscissas (x-coordinates), we need to determine the maximum number of good parabolas. A parabola is called good if there are no marked points on it or above it, except for the two points through which it is drawn. Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Understanding Good Parabolas: A parabola is good if no other points lie on or above it except the two points defining it. Since parabolas open upwards (leading coefficient 1), the region above a parabola is convex.2. Small Values Analysis:   - For ( n = 2 ), there is only one parabola, which is trivially good.   - For ( n = 3 ), arranging points such that the third point is below the parabola connecting the other two results in 2 good parabolas.   - For ( n = 4 ), arranging points in a convex shape (e.g., U-shape) or on a straight line results in 3 good parabolas.3. General Pattern:   - When points are arranged in a convex shape or on a straight line, each consecutive pair of points forms a good parabola.   - Non-consecutive parabolas tend to have other points above them due to the convex nature of parabolas opening upwards.4. Conclusion:   - For ( n ) points, arranging them such that each consecutive pair forms a good parabola results in ( n - 1 ) good parabolas. This is because each consecutive parabola is below the other points, and non-consecutive parabolas will have points above them. Final Answer:The maximum number of good parabolas that could result is (boxed{n-1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-618a4ba7></div><p class="review-content" data-v-618a4ba7><span class="icon" data-v-618a4ba7>🔑:</span>Answer: n-1 parabolas. Example: parabolas passing through n points on the X-axis. Evaluation: connect two marked points with an edge if the parabola passing through them is good. Suppose that two good parabolas pass through a given point A. To the right of point A, one of the parabolas lies above the other, so it cannot be the case that the second marked points on each of the two parabolas are to the right of A. Therefore, from each point, there can be at most two edges - one to the right, and one (for similar reasons) to the left. Moreover, from the leftmost and rightmost points, there can be at most one edge. Therefore, there are no more than n-1 edges, i.e., no more than n-1 good parabolas.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-00f939b7><span data-v-00f939b7>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
