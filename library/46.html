Let me start by writing down the equations to make sure I understand them correctly.The problem states:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1]and[frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1]Then, we have to determine which of the options (A) through (D) is correct.First, let me parse these equations. The second equation seems straightforward. If (frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1), then taking reciprocals on both sides gives:[x + y + z = 1]So, the sum of x, y, and z is 1. That&#39;s helpful.Now, the first equation is the sum of reciprocals of x, y, and z equaling 1:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1]So, we have two equations:1. (x + y + z = 1)2. (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1)The question is asking about the possible values of x, y, z. The options are about whether at least one equals 1, all equal 1, none equal 1, or none of the above.Let me consider each option step by step.Option A says &quot;x, y, z at least one equals 1.&quot; So, this would mean that among the three variables, at least one of them is 1. Let&#39;s see if this must be true.Option B claims all three equal 1. If that&#39;s the case, then check the equations:If x = y = z = 1, then x + y + z = 3, but we have x + y + z = 1 from the second equation. So, that&#39;s already a contradiction. Therefore, option B is impossible. So, B is out.Option C states &quot;x, y, z none equal 1.&quot; So, none of them is 1. The question is, can we have solutions where none of x, y, z is 1, or is it necessary that at least one is 1?Option D says none of the above conclusions are correct. So, if neither A, B, nor C is necessarily true, then D is the answer.Since B is already invalid because if all were 1, their sum would be 3, not 1. So B is wrong.So, between A, C, D.We need to check if it&#39;s possible to have all variables not equal to 1 (which would make C possible) or if at least one must be 1 (A). If there exist solutions where none is 1 and solutions where at least one is 1, then D would be correct. But if all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 1, then A is correct. If all solutions must have none equal to 1, then C is correct.So, need to explore possible solutions.Let me start by trying to find possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy both equations. Let me consider variables such that x + y + z = 1 and 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1.First, let me see if there&#39;s a case where none of x, y, z is 1. Let&#39;s suppose that all variables are different from 1. Let&#39;s try some numbers.Alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate the equations.We have x + y + z = 1.Also, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1.Let me denote S = x + y + z = 1.Let me denote H = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1.Let me consider the harmonic mean aspect here. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other algebraic identity, but since we have specific values, maybe manipulating equations would be better.Alternatively, cross-multiplying.Let me see. Let&#39;s consider that:1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1Multiply both sides by xyz:yz + xz + xy = xyzSo, we have:xy + yz + zx = xyzAnd we also have x + y + z = 1.So, the two equations are:1. x + y + z = 12. xy + yz + zx = xyzLet me see if I can manipulate these equations.From equation 2: xy + yz + zx = xyzLet me divide both sides by xyz (assuming x, y, z ≠ 0, which they can&#39;t be because we have reciprocals in the original equation):(1/z) + (1/x) + (1/y) = 1Wait, that&#39;s the original equation. Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps express one variable in terms of others from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.Let me suppose that z = 1 - x - y.Then, substitute z into equation 2: xy + y(1 - x - y) + x(1 - x - y) = xy(1 - x - y)Let me compute each term:First term: xySecond term: y(1 - x - y) = y - xy - y²Third term: x(1 - x - y) = x - x² - xySumming these up:xy + (y - xy - y²) + (x - x² - xy) =xy + y - xy - y² + x - x² - xy =Combine like terms:xy - xy - xy = -xyy + x-y² - x²So, total expression:x + y - xy - x² - y²On the right side, equation 2 is equal to xyz. Substituting z = 1 - x - y:Right side: xy(1 - x - y) = xy - x²y - xy²Therefore, equation becomes:Left side: x + y - xy - x² - y² = Right side: xy - x²y - xy²Bring all terms to left:x + y - xy - x² - y² - xy + x²y + xy² = 0Simplify:x + y - 2xy - x² - y² + x²y + xy² = 0Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s assume symmetry. Maybe there&#39;s a symmetric solution where x = y = z.If x = y = z, then from x + y + z = 1, we have 3x = 1 =&gt; x = 1/3.Then, check if 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1. Since all are 1/3, their reciprocals are 3 each. So 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 ≠ 1. Therefore, this is not a solution. So symmetric solution does not work.Therefore, perhaps variables are not all equal.Alternatively, suppose that one variable is 1. Let&#39;s test option A by assuming one variable is 1.Let me suppose x = 1. Then, from x + y + z = 1, we have 1 + y + z = 1 =&gt; y + z = 0. But since variables are in denominators, they can&#39;t be zero. So y + z = 0 would require y = -z, but then 1/y and 1/z would be -1/z and 1/z, which would sum to zero. Then 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1 + 0 = 1, which satisfies the first equation. But wait, if y + z = 0, then y = -z, so z = -y. Then 1/y + 1/z = 1/y - 1/y = 0. Therefore, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1 + 0 = 1, which works. But y and z would have to be non-zero, but their sum is zero. So, for example, if x = 1, y = 2, z = -1. Then x + y + z = 1 + 2 + (-1) = 2, which is not 1. Wait, no. Wait, if x = 1, then y + z = 0. So y and z are negatives of each other.Wait, but then if y and z are negatives, but let&#39;s take concrete numbers. Suppose x=1, y=2, z=-2. Then x + y + z =1 +2 -2=1, which satisfies the second equation. Then check the first equation: 1/1 +1/2 +1/(-2)=1 +0.5 -0.5=1. So, yes, that works.But here, z is -2, which is allowed? Wait, the problem didn&#39;t specify that x, y, z have to be positive. Hmmm. If they can be negative, then yes, such a solution exists. But if they have to be positive, then y and z would have to be positive numbers summing to zero, which is impossible. Therefore, if we allow negative numbers, such a solution exists where x=1, y and z are negative reciprocals. But if we assume x, y, z must be positive, then y + z =0 would require y=z=0, which is not allowed.But the problem didn&#39;t specify that x, y, z are positive. So, depending on the problem&#39;s constraints, the variables could be negative. Wait, but in the original equations, we have 1/x, 1/y, 1/z. So, x, y, z cannot be zero, but they can be negative unless otherwise specified.So, assuming that negative numbers are allowed, such a solution exists where one variable is 1, and the other two are negatives summing to zero. For example, x=1, y=2, z=-1. Then, x+y+z=1+2-1=2. Wait, that&#39;s not 1. Wait, hold on.Wait, if x=1, then y + z must be 0. So, if y=1, z=-1, then x+y+z=1+1-1=1, which works. Then 1/x +1/y +1/z=1 +1 +(-1)=1, which works. So, in this case, x=1, y=1, z=-1. Then, z=-1. So, variables can be negative, so this is a valid solution. Here, x=1, y=1, z=-1. So, in this case, two variables are 1, one is -1. So, according to option A, &quot;at least one equals 1&quot;, which is true here. So this is a valid solution where at least one variable is 1.But, is there a solution where none of the variables is 1?Let me try to find such a solution. Suppose none of x, y, z is 1. Let&#39;s try some numbers.Let me suppose x=2. Then, from x + y + z =1, y + z = -1. Then, 1/x +1/y +1/z=1/2 +1/y +1/z=1. So, 1/y +1/z=1 -1/2=1/2. But y + z =-1.So, let me set y + z = -1 and 1/y +1/z=1/2.Let me denote y + z = S = -1, and y z = P.Then, 1/y +1/z= (y + z)/(y z) = S/P = (-1)/P =1/2. Therefore, (-1)/P=1/2 =&gt; P= -2.So, we have y and z such that y + z = -1 and y z = -2.This is a quadratic equation: t^2 - S t + P =0 =&gt; t^2 + t -2=0.Solutions: t = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +8)]/2 = [-1 ±3]/2. Therefore, t=1 or t=-2.Thus, y=1, z=-2 or y=-2, z=1.So, if x=2, y=1, z=-2, then x+y+z=2 +1 -2=1, which works. Then 1/x +1/y +1/z=1/2 +1 + (-1/2)=1/2 +1 -1/2=1, which also works.But in this case, y=1. So, even though I tried to set x=2, y turned out to be 1. So, at least one variable is 1.Alternatively, suppose x=3. Then y + z=1 -3= -2. Then, 1/x +1/y +1/z=1/3 +1/y +1/z=1, so 1/y +1/z=2/3.Then, with y + z=-2, and 1/y +1/z=2/3.Again, S = y + z =-2, and 1/y +1/z= (y + z)/(y z)= S/P= -2/P=2/3. Therefore, -2/P=2/3 =&gt; P= -3.Thus, y and z satisfy t^2 - S t + P=0 =&gt; t^2 +2t -3=0. Solutions: t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +12)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(16)]/2 = [-2 ±4]/2 =&gt; t=1 or t=-3.Therefore, y=1, z=-3 or vice versa.Again, one of the variables is 1. So, this seems to be a pattern. Whenever I fix x to some value, and solve for y and z, one of them turns out to be 1. So, maybe in any solution, at least one variable must be 1? If that&#39;s the case, then Option A is correct. But wait, is there a solution where none is 1?Alternatively, let me suppose that two variables are equal. Let&#39;s say x = y. Then, from x + y + z =1, we have 2x + z =1 =&gt; z=1 -2x.From the first equation, 1/x +1/x +1/z=1 =&gt; 2/x +1/z=1.Substitute z=1 -2x:2/x +1/(1 -2x)=1.Let me solve this equation for x.Multiply both sides by x(1 -2x):2(1 -2x) +x = x(1 -2x)Expand left side:2 -4x +x = 2 -3xRight side: x -2x²So:2 -3x =x -2x²Bring all terms to left:2 -3x -x +2x²=0 =&gt; 2x² -4x +2=0Divide by 2:x² -2x +1=0 =&gt; (x -1)^2=0 =&gt; x=1.Therefore, x=1, then z=1 -2x=1 -2= -1.Thus, x=y=1, z=-1. So, even in this case, two variables are 1. So again, variables can be 1.But perhaps there&#39;s another approach where none are 1. Let me see.Wait, perhaps if we take variables different from 1 but with one variable being 1 in another solution.But in the previous trials, when I set x to some number, the variables y and z turned out to have one of them being 1. So maybe in all solutions, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, Option A would be correct.But wait, is that necessarily true? Let me try to find a solution where none of the variables is 1.Suppose x=2, y=3. Then z=1 -2 -3= -4. Then check the sum of reciprocals:1/2 +1/3 +1/(-4)=0.5 +0.333... -0.25≈0.5 +0.333 -0.25≈0.583. That&#39;s less than 1. So, not equal to 1. So, this does not satisfy the first equation.Alternatively, let me try x= -1. Then y + z=1 -(-1)=2. Let me set y=2, z=0. But z=0 is invalid. So, not allowed. y=3, z=-1. Then 1/x +1/y +1/z=1/(-1) +1/3 +1/(-1)= -1 +1/3 -1= -1.666..., which is not 1.Alternatively, take x= -0.5. Then y + z=1 -(-0.5)=1.5. Let me set y=2, z=-0.5. Then check the reciprocals: 1/(-0.5) +1/2 +1/(-0.5)= -2 +0.5 -2= -3.5≠1. Nope.Alternatively, perhaps x=1/2. Then y + z=1 -1/2=1/2. Let me set y=1/3, then z=1/2 -1/3=1/6. Then check reciprocals: 1/(1/2) +1/(1/3) +1/(1/6)=2 +3 +6=11≠1. Not working.Alternatively, maybe fractions with negatives. Let me try x=1/2, y=1/3, z=1 -1/2 -1/3=1 -5/6=1/6. Then, reciprocals: 2 +3 +6=11≠1. Nope.Alternatively, set x=2, y=-1, z=0. But z=0 invalid.Alternatively, take x=3, y=-1, z= -1. Then x+y+z=3 -1 -1=1. Then reciprocals: 1/3 + (-1) + (-1)=1/3 -2≈-1.666≠1.Alternatively, x=4, y=-1, z=-2. Then x+y+z=4-1-2=1. Then reciprocals: 1/4 + (-1) + (-1/2)=1/4 -1.5= -1.25≠1.This approach isn&#39;t working. Maybe another method.Wait, let&#39;s suppose that none of x, y, z is 1. Let me suppose that variables are such that all are different from 1.But in all the trials above, when I set two variables, one of them ends up being 1. So, is there a mathematical reason why at least one variable must be 1?Let me look back at the equations:We have x + y + z =1 and xy + yz + zx =xyz.Let me rearrange the second equation:xy + yz + zx -xyz=0Factor:xy(1 - z) + z(x + y)=0But since x + y =1 - z (from first equation), substitute:xy(1 - z) + z(1 - z)=0Factor out (1 - z):(1 - z)(xy + z)=0Therefore, either 1 - z=0 =&gt; z=1, or xy + z=0.Similarly, if we factor for x or y, we get similar equations.Therefore, from equation 2: (1 - z)(xy + z)=0. So, either z=1 or xy + z=0.Similarly, if we had factored by x or y, we would get similar conditions.Therefore, either one of the variables is 1, or for each variable, the product of the other two plus that variable equals zero.So, for variable x: either x=1 or y z +x=0.Similarly for y: either y=1 or x z +y=0.And for z: either z=1 or x y +z=0.Therefore, either one of the variables is 1, or for each variable, x y +z=0, etc.So, if none of the variables is 1, then we must have:xy + z =0,xz + y =0,yz + x =0.So, three equations:1. xy + z =0,2. xz + y =0,3. yz + x =0.Let me see if such a system has a solution.From equation 1: z = -xyFrom equation 2: xz + y=0. Substitute z from equation 1: x*(-xy) + y=0 =&gt; -x² y + y=0 =&gt; y(-x² +1)=0.Similarly, from equation 3: yz +x=0. Substitute z=-xy: y*(-xy) +x=0 =&gt; -x y² +x=0 =&gt; x(-y² +1)=0.So, from equation 2: y(-x² +1)=0. So either y=0 or x²=1.But variables can&#39;t be 0. So, x²=1 =&gt; x=1 or x=-1.Similarly, from equation 3: x(-y² +1)=0 =&gt; same reasoning, either x=0 (invalid) or y²=1 =&gt; y=1 or y=-1.But if we are assuming that none of x, y, z is 1, then x and y must be -1.So, x=-1, y=-1.Then from equation 1: z = -x y = -(-1)(-1) = -1.So, z=-1.Check if x + y + z =1: (-1) + (-1) + (-1) =-3 ≠1. So, this does not satisfy the first equation. Therefore, contradiction.Therefore, the system has no solution where none of the variables is 1. Therefore, the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 1.Therefore, Option A is correct.But wait, let me check this conclusion.If we assume none of the variables is 1, then we end up with x=-1, y=-1, z=-1, which doesn&#39;t satisfy x + y + z=1, so no solution in that case. Therefore, in all solutions, at least one variable must be 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But earlier, when I took x=1, y=1, z=-1, that was a valid solution with two variables equal to 1. Also, x=1, y=2, z=-2, that was a solution where only x=1, and others different. Similarly, x=1, y=3, z=-3, etc. So, these solutions have at least one variable equal to 1.But, hold on, in the case where we had x=1, y=1, z=-1, then two variables are 1, which is allowed under Option A (at least one). So, that&#39;s fine.But earlier, when I tried to set x=2, then y or z had to be 1. So, seems like in any case, at least one variable must be 1.Hence, Option A is correct.But wait, the original problem includes option D: None of the above. So, need to check if the reasoning is solid.But according to the equations, if none of the variables can be non-1 (as we saw that assuming none leads to a contradiction with x + y + z=1), then all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But wait, another thought. Suppose we have two variables equal to 1. For example, x=1, y=1, z=-1. Then, this is a valid solution. So, in this case, two variables are 1. Similarly, x=1, y=2, z=-2. So, only x=1. So, in all cases, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But hold on, the problem says &quot;at least one equals 1&quot;. So, does that mean that in every possible solution, at least one of x, y, z must be 1? If that&#39;s the case, then A is correct. If there exists a solution where none is 1, then A is incorrect.But from the earlier analysis, such a solution cannot exist because assuming all variables ≠1 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Option A is correct.But wait, the problem&#39;s options are:(A) x, y, z at least one equals 1(B) all equal 1(C) none equal 1(D) None of the above.But if A is correct, then D is incorrect. However, the problem is in Chinese, and the translation might be tricky. Wait, the original problem is:&quot;5. Oar: (frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}+frac{1}{z}=frac{1}{x+y+z}=1), then ( ). (A ) (x, y, z) at least one equals 1 ( B ) (x, y, z) all equal 1 . ( C ) (x, y, z) none equal 1 . (D) None of the above conclusions are correct.&quot;So, the question is: given the two equations, which of the conclusions A, B, C, D must be true.We have already found that in all solutions, at least one variable must be 1 (so A must be true), but the example x=1, y=1, z=-1 is a solution where two variables are 1, and another example x=1, y=2, z=-2 is a solution where only one variable is 1. Also, there are no solutions where none are 1. So, in all cases, at least one is 1. Therefore, A must be true.But wait, let&#39;s check if in all solutions, at least one variable is 1. Suppose there&#39;s a solution where none is 1. If that&#39;s possible, then A is false. But according to the equations, if none is 1, then variables must satisfy xy + z=0, xz + y=0, yz + x=0, which leads to x=y=z=-1, but then x+y+z=-3≠1. Therefore, no solution exists where none are 1. Therefore, in every solution, at least one variable must be 1. Therefore, A is correct.But let me check another example. Suppose x=1, y=0.5, z=-0.5. Then x+y+z=1+0.5-0.5=1. Then reciprocals:1 +2 +(-2)=1. Yes, that works. Here, x=1, y=0.5, z=-0.5. So, x=1, others are not 1.Another example: x=1, y=3, z=-3. Then x+y+z=1+3-3=1. Reciprocals:1 +1/3 -1/3=1. That works.But if I assume x, y, z are positive, then in such a case, y + z=0, which would require y=z=0, which is invalid. Therefore, if the problem restricts variables to positive numbers, then y + z=0 is impossible. Therefore, if variables must be positive, then the previous solutions are invalid. Wait, but the problem didn&#39;t specify positivity. If variables can be negative, then such solutions exist.But in Chinese math problems, unless specified, variables are often considered to be real numbers unless otherwise stated. So, allowing negative numbers, solutions exist where one variable is 1, others are not. But if restricted to positive numbers, we need to check.Wait, if variables must be positive, then x + y + z =1 and all variables positive. Then, x, y, z are positive numbers summing to 1. Then, 1/x +1/y +1/z=1.But in this case, if all variables are positive and less than or equal to 1, their reciprocals would be greater or equal to 1. For example, if x=0.5, then 1/x=2. So, if all variables are less than 1, their reciprocals would add up to more than 3. If variables are greater than 1, their reciprocals are less than 1. But since their sum is 1, which is positive, variables can be a mix of positive and negative, but with at least one positive to sum to 1. However, this complicates things.But perhaps the problem allows negative numbers. If variables can be negative, then solutions where one variable is 1 exist. If variables must be positive, then perhaps no solutions exist? Wait, let&#39;s check.If variables are restricted to positive numbers, then x + y + z=1, and all x, y, z&gt;0.Then, 1/x +1/y +1/z=1.But using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (x + y + z)(1/x +1/y +1/z) ≥ (1 +1 +1)^2=9.But here, x + y + z=1, so 1 * (1/x +1/y +1/z) ≥9, which implies that 1/x +1/y +1/z ≥9&gt;1. Therefore, if variables are positive, then 1/x +1/y +1/z ≥9, which contradicts the given equation 1/x +1/y +1/z=1. Therefore, no solution exists with positive variables.Therefore, if the problem assumes variables are positive, then no solutions exist. But in that case, the equations are impossible. However, the problem presents the equations as given, so presumably, they have solutions, which must involve negative numbers.Therefore, going back, the variables can be negative, and in such cases, at least one variable must be 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But the problem is presented in Chinese, possibly from an exam, and in some exams, variables are assumed to be positive unless stated otherwise. However, since the problem includes 1/(x + y + z)=1, and x + y + z=1, if variables are positive, then 1/x +1/y +1/z would have to be at least 9, which contradicts the given equation. Therefore, the problem must allow negative variables.Therefore, given that, the conclusion is that in all solutions, at least one variable equals 1. Hence, Option A is correct.Wait, but earlier when we thought that variables can be negative, but the equations lead to the necessity of at least one variable being 1, so regardless of positivity, as long as variables are real numbers (excluding zero), then in any solution, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But wait, let me confirm with another example where perhaps two variables are reciprocals or something else. Wait, but according to the earlier algebra, if none of the variables is 1, then we end up with x=y=z=-1, which doesn&#39;t satisfy x + y + z=1. Therefore, there&#39;s no solution where none is 1. Therefore, in every solution, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.But the answer options are given as (A) through (D). However, in the original problem statement, the equations are:(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1)and(frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1)which implies x + y + z=1.But according to the analysis, if variables can be negative, then at least one variable must be 1, hence Option A is correct.But the answer might be different. Wait, let me check again.Wait, in our previous example, x=1, y=1, z=-1. Then x=1, y=1, z=-1. So, here, two variables are 1, but according to the problem, the options are:(A) At least one equals 1.(B) All equal 1.(C) None equal 1.(D) None of the above.Given that in this example, two variables are 1, which satisfies Option A. Since there exists a solution where two are 1, but there are also solutions where only one is 1, so A is correct. B is incorrect because in this example, not all are 1 (z=-1). C is incorrect because in all solutions, at least one is 1. Therefore, the correct answer is A.However, wait, another perspective: The problem is a Chinese problem, and in Chinese math problems, sometimes specific conditions are assumed, like variables being positive integers unless stated otherwise. However, in this problem, there&#39;s no such restriction. Therefore, given the analysis, the answer should be A.But wait, let me check once more. Suppose x=1, y=2, z=-2. Then, x + y + z=1+2-2=1, and 1/x +1/y +1/z=1 +0.5 -0.5=1. So, this is a valid solution with x=1, y and z not 1. So, in this solution, only x is 1. So, at least one is 1. So, A is satisfied.Is there a solution where, say, x=2, y= something, z= something, such that none are 1? According to previous trials, when I tried to set x=2, then solving led to y or z=1. So, such a solution does not exist where none are 1.Therefore, the answer is A.But the given options are:(A) At least one equals 1.(B) All equal 1.(C) None equal 1.(D) None of the above.Given that A is always true, so the answer is A.However, in some sources, the answer might be D. Wait, let me verify again.Wait, the problem says &quot;then ( ). (A ) x, y, z at least one equals 1 ( B ) x, y, z all equal 1 . ( C ) x, y, z none equal 1 . (D) None of the above conclusions are correct.&quot;If the answer is A, then the conclusion is A. But maybe the question is a trick question. Let me check again.In the example where x=1, y=1, z=-1, this is a solution where two variables are 1, but not all. So, at least one is 1. Therefore, A holds. Another example, x=1, y=2, z=-2: only x=1. So, A holds.But what if there is a solution where none are 1? If such a solution exists, then A is false. But according to the algebra, such a solution does not exist. Therefore, A must be true. Hence, the answer is A.But in the problem statement, is there any restriction on the variables? If variables are allowed to be negative, then A is correct. If variables are restricted to positive numbers, then no solutions exist. However, given that 1/(x + y + z)=1 implies x + y + z=1, which is possible with positive variables, but as per the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the reciprocals would be too large. Thus, no solution with positive variables exists.Therefore, variables must be allowed to be negative, in which case solutions exist where at least one variable is 1. Therefore, A is correct.Thus, the answer should be A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1]and[frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1]we start by noting that the second equation simplifies to (x + y + z = 1).We need to determine the validity of the given options. 1. Option B: If (x = y = z = 1), then (x + y + z = 3), which contradicts (x + y + z = 1). Hence, B is incorrect.2. Option C: We need to check if there exists a solution where none of (x, y, z) is 1. Through algebraic manipulation and substitution, we find that assuming none of the variables is 1 leads to a contradiction. For example, solving the system of equations derived from (xy + z = 0), (xz + y = 0), and (yz + x = 0) results in (x = y = z = -1), which does not satisfy (x + y + z = 1). Therefore, C is incorrect.3. Option A: We check if at least one variable must be 1. By solving the equations and testing various values, we find that in any valid solution, at least one variable must be 1. For example, setting (x = 1) leads to valid solutions such as (x = 1, y = 1, z = -1) or (x = 1, y = 2, z = -2). These solutions satisfy both equations and show that at least one variable is 1. Since we have shown that in all valid solutions, at least one variable must be 1, Option A is correct. Thus, the final answer is:[boxed{A}],&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to tackle this problem. So, we have the equation (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1) and also (frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1). The question is asking which of the options A, B, C, or D is correct based on these equations. Let me break it down step by step.First, let&#39;s parse the given equations. The second equation is (frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1), which implies that (x + y + z = 1). So the sum of x, y, z is 1. Then the first equation is the sum of their reciprocals equal to 1 as well: (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1). We need to find out whether at least one of x, y, z equals 1 (option A), all of them equal 1 (option B), none equal 1 (option C), or none of these conclusions are correct (option D).Let me first check if option B is possible. If all x, y, z equal 1, then their sum would be 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, but from the second equation, we know x + y + z must be 1. So that&#39;s a contradiction. Therefore, option B is not possible. So we can eliminate option B.Next, let&#39;s check option A: at least one of x, y, z equals 1. Suppose one of them is 1, say x = 1. Then the equations become:(frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1) which simplifies to (1 + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1), so (frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 0). But since reciprocals of real numbers can&#39;t be zero unless y or z is infinite, which isn&#39;t practical here. Wait, but x, y, z can be negative numbers? Hmm, the problem didn&#39;t specify that x, y, z are positive. So if y and z are negative, their reciprocals could add to a negative number. Let&#39;s explore this.Suppose x = 1, then x + y + z = 1 implies 1 + y + z = 1, so y + z = 0. Therefore, z = -y. Then substituting back into the first equation:(frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{-y} = 1 + frac{1}{y} - frac{1}{y} = 1 + 0 = 1). Hey, that works! So if x = 1, y = any non-zero real number, and z = -y, then both equations are satisfied. For example, let’s take y = 2, then z = -2. Then x + y + z = 1 + 2 + (-2) = 1, which matches the second equation. Then the first equation: 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/(-2) = 1 + 0.5 - 0.5 = 1, which also works. So in this case, x = 1, but y and z are 2 and -2, which are not 1. So here, only x is 1, so at least one variable is 1. Therefore, option A could be correct.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s a case where none of x, y, z is 1. If such a case exists, then option A would not necessarily hold, and option D would be the answer. Let&#39;s see if such a solution exists.Suppose none of x, y, z is 1. Let&#39;s attempt to find such numbers. We have x + y + z = 1, and 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1.Let me consider variables a, b, c such that a = x, b = y, c = z. Then a + b + c = 1, and 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1.We need to find a, b, c ≠ 1 that satisfy these equations.Let me try to find such numbers. Let&#39;s assume two variables are equal for simplicity. Let&#39;s say a = b. Then we have 2a + c = 1 =&gt; c = 1 - 2a.Then the reciprocal equation becomes 2/a + 1/c = 1. Substitute c = 1 - 2a:2/a + 1/(1 - 2a) = 1.Let&#39;s solve this equation for a.Multiply both sides by a(1 - 2a):2(1 - 2a) + a = a(1 - 2a)Expand:2 - 4a + a = a - 2a²Simplify left side:2 - 3a = a - 2a²Bring all terms to one side:2 - 3a - a + 2a² = 0 =&gt; 2a² - 4a + 2 = 0Divide by 2:a² - 2a + 1 = 0 =&gt; (a - 1)^2 = 0 =&gt; a = 1But if a = 1, then c = 1 - 2*1 = -1. Then variables would be a = 1, b = 1, c = -1. But in this case, a and b are 1, so we have variables equal to 1. Therefore, this case leads to a = 1, which contradicts our assumption that none of them is 1. So this approach leads to a solution where a variable is 1.But maybe another approach where variables are different. Let&#39;s suppose all three variables are different and none is 1.Let me consider another example. Suppose x = 2. Then x + y + z = 1 =&gt; y + z = -1. The reciprocal equation is 1/2 + 1/y + 1/z = 1 =&gt; 1/y + 1/z = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Let’s set y + z = -1 and 1/y + 1/z = 1/2.Express 1/y + 1/z = (y + z)/yz = (-1)/yz = 1/2. So, (-1)/yz = 1/2 =&gt; yz = -2.So we have y + z = -1 and y z = -2. Let&#39;s solve for y and z.The quadratic equation would be t^2 + t - 2 = 0. Solutions:t = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [-1 ± 3]/2Thus, t = (2)/2 = 1 or t = (-4)/2 = -2.So y = 1 and z = -2 or vice versa. But if y = 1, then one of the variables is 1. But we supposed x = 2 and y = 1, so this gives x = 2, y = 1, z = -2. Then x + y + z = 2 + 1 -2 = 1, which works. The reciprocals: 1/2 + 1/1 + 1/(-2) = 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1. So again, we have y = 1 here. So even if we set x = 2, we end up with another variable being 1. So this suggests that perhaps in all solutions, at least one variable must be 1. But wait, is that necessarily true?Wait, maybe there&#39;s another way. Suppose all variables are different and none is 1. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s possible. Let me try to set x = 3. Then x + y + z = 1 =&gt; y + z = -2. The reciprocals: 1/3 + 1/y + 1/z = 1 =&gt; 1/y + 1/z = 2/3. Then, (y + z)/yz = (-2)/yz = 2/3 =&gt; yz = (-2)*(3/2) = -3. So we need y + z = -2 and y z = -3.Solving quadratic equation: t^2 + 2t - 3 = 0. Solutions: t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4]/2. So t = (2)/2 = 1 or t = (-6)/2 = -3. So y = 1, z = -3 or vice versa. Again, y or z is 1. So in this case, even when x = 3, another variable becomes 1.Hmm, so maybe every solution requires at least one variable to be 1. Wait, but let me check another example. Let&#39;s suppose x = 0.5. Then x + y + z = 1 =&gt; y + z = 0.5. The reciprocal equation: 1/0.5 + 1/y + 1/z = 2 + 1/y + 1/z = 1 =&gt; 1/y + 1/z = -1. Also, (y + z)/yz = 0.5/yz = -1 =&gt; yz = -0.5. So we have y + z = 0.5 and y z = -0.5. The quadratic equation: t^2 - 0.5t - 0.5 = 0. Solutions: t = [0.5 ± sqrt(0.25 + 2)] / 2 = [0.5 ± sqrt(2.25)] / 2 = [0.5 ± 1.5]/2. So t = (2)/2 = 1 or t = (-1)/2 = -0.5. Therefore, y = 1 and z = -0.5 or vice versa. Again, y or z is 1. So in this case, x = 0.5, y = 1, z = -0.5. So again, one variable is 1.Is there a way to have x, y, z all not equal to 1? Let&#39;s see. Let me consider x, y, z such that none is 1, but the sum is 1 and reciprocals sum to 1.Suppose x = 2, y = 3. Then x + y + z = 1 =&gt; z = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4. Then the reciprocals: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/(-4) = 0.5 + 0.333... - 0.25 = 0.583..., which is not 1. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, suppose x = -1. Then x + y + z =1 =&gt; y + z = 2. Reciprocals: 1/(-1) + 1/y + 1/z = -1 + 1/y + 1/z =1. So 1/y +1/z = 2. Then (y + z)/yz = 2/(yz) =2. So 2/(yz) = 2 =&gt; yz =1. Then with y + z = 2 and yz =1. Quadratic equation: t^2 -2t +1=0. Solution: (t -1)^2=0 =&gt; t=1. So y=1, z=1. Then variables are x=-1, y=1, z=1. So again, two variables are 1.So even if x is -1, the other variables become 1. It seems that in every case, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, option A is correct.But wait, let me test another approach. Suppose two variables are reciprocals such that their reciprocals add up to a certain value. Maybe if all three variables are different and none is 1. Let&#39;s try to set up equations.Let’s assume x, y, z are all not 1. Then according to our previous attempts, whenever we fix one variable, the other variables end up being 1. But maybe there&#39;s a case where variables are fractions or something else.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a solution where x, y, z are all different and none is 1. Let&#39;s try to find such a solution.Let me consider variables x, y, z such that x + y + z =1 and 1/x +1/y +1/z=1. Let me denote S = x + y + z =1, P = xyz, Q = xy + yz + zx.We know that 1/x +1/y +1/z = (xy + yz + zx)/xyz = Q/P =1. So Q = P.So we have S=1, Q=P. Also, we can recall that in cubic equations, if x, y, z are roots of t^3 - St^2 + Qt - P =0, then substituting S=1, Q=P, the equation becomes t^3 - t^2 + Pt - P =0. Hmm, so t^3 - t^2 + P(t -1)=0. Factor this: t^2(t -1) + P(t -1)= (t -1)(t^2 + P)=0. Therefore, the roots are t=1 and t=±√(-P). So if t=1 is a root, then one of x, y, z is 1, which brings us back to the previous cases. If not, then the roots are complex, but the problem didn&#39;t specify if variables are real or complex. However, in the answer choices, it&#39;s implied that variables are real numbers since they talk about equaling 1 or not. Therefore, if variables are real, then the cubic equation must have at least one real root. If we assume all variables are real, then t=1 must be a root, meaning one of the variables is 1. Therefore, in real numbers, there must be at least one variable equal to 1. Therefore, option A is correct.But wait, the problem didn&#39;t specify if x, y, z are real numbers. If they can be complex, then maybe there are solutions where none of them is 1. For example, if P is such that t^2 + P =0, then roots are t=1, t=i√P, t=-i√P. Then x=1, y=i√P, z=-i√P. Then sum x + y + z=1 +0=1. Reciprocals: 1/1 +1/(i√P) +1/(-i√P)=1 + (-i/√P) + (i/√P)=1 +0=1. So this works. But here x=1, so again, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, even in complex numbers, we still have one variable equal to 1. Therefore, unless we can have all roots being complex and not equal to 1, but according to the cubic equation above, if variables are all complex and not 1, then they must satisfy t^2 + P =0, but then x + y + z would be 1 +0=1. Wait, but the sum of roots of t^3 - t^2 + Pt - P=0 is 1 (from coefficient of t^2). If one root is 1, the other two roots sum to 0. If we avoid having 1 as a root, then all roots are non-real, but for a cubic with real coefficients, non-real roots come in conjugate pairs. So in that case, two roots are complex conjugates, and the third root is real. Since the sum of roots is 1, the real root must be 1, which brings us back. Therefore, even in complex numbers, there must be a real root at 1. Hence, in all cases, real or complex, there must be at least one variable equal to 1. Therefore, option A is correct.But wait, hold on. In the complex case, if we don&#39;t restrict variables to be real, can we have a solution where none of x, y, z is 1? Let me see. Suppose all three roots are complex and not equal to 1. But the cubic equation t^3 - t^2 + Pt - P =0. If none of the roots is 1, then we can factor it as (t - a)(t - b)(t - c) where a, b, c ≠1. But expanding this, we get t^3 - (a + b + c)t^2 + (ab + bc + ac)t - abc. Comparing with our cubic equation, we have:a + b + c =1ab + bc + ac = Pabc = PSo ab + bc + ac = abc. Let me see if this is possible with a, b, c ≠1.Let me divide both sides by abc (assuming none are zero):(ab + bc + ac)/abc = 1 =&gt; 1/c + 1/a + 1/b =1.But we also have a + b + c =1. So, these variables would satisfy the same equations as the original problem. Therefore, if there exists a solution where a, b, c ≠1, then that would mean we can have x, y, z all not equal to 1. But according to the previous logic, since the cubic must have at least one real root, which would be 1, unless we have three complex roots, which is not possible with real coefficients. Wait, no. A cubic with real coefficients must have at least one real root. So if the coefficients are real, which they are here (since S=1, Q=P, and P is a real number if variables are real, but if variables are complex, P can be complex). Wait, but in our original problem, the equations are given without specifying the domain of x, y, z. If the problem allows complex numbers, then maybe P can be complex. So in that case, perhaps there exists a solution where all variables are complex and not equal to 1. Let&#39;s try to find such a solution.Suppose we set a =1 + i, b =1 - i, c = -1. Then a + b + c =1 +i +1 -i -1=1. Check reciprocals: 1/(1+i) +1/(1 -i) +1/(-1). Let&#39;s compute:1/(1+i) = (1 -i)/2, 1/(1 -i) = (1 +i)/2, so their sum is (1 -i +1 +i)/2 = 2/2 =1. Then adding 1/(-1) = -1. So total sum is 1 -1 =0 ≠1. So that doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to find complex numbers a, b, c such that a + b + c=1 and 1/a +1/b +1/c=1. Let&#39;s assume two variables are complex conjugates and the third is real but not 1. Let’s say c is real, and a = p + qi, b = p - qi.Then a + b + c = 2p + c =1 =&gt; c=1 -2p.The reciprocals:1/a +1/b +1/c = [ (b + a) / (ab) ] +1/c = [2p / (p^2 + q^2)] + 1/c =1.But c=1 -2p. So:2p / (p^2 + q^2) + 1/(1 -2p) =1.This equation might have solutions where p and q are real numbers. Let&#39;s attempt to solve it.Let’s set p=0. Then c=1 -0=1. Then reciprocals become 0/(0 + q^2) +1/1=0 +1=1, which works. But then c=1, so one variable is 1. Which is the case we already know.If p≠0, say p=0.5. Then c=1 -2*(0.5)=0. Then 1/c is undefined. So p cannot be 0.5.How about p=0.25. Then c=1 -2*(0.25)=0.5. Then the equation becomes:2*(0.25)/(0.0625 + q^2) + 1/0.5 = 0.5/(0.0625 + q^2) + 2 =1. Therefore, 0.5/(0.0625 + q^2) =-1. But left side is positive, right side is negative. No solution.If p=-0.5, then c=1 -2*(-0.5)=1 +1=2. Then equation becomes:2*(-0.5)/(0.25 + q^2) +1/2 = -1/(0.25 + q^2) +0.5 =1. So -1/(0.25 + q^2) =0.5 =&gt; 0.25 + q^2 = -2. But 0.25 + q^2 is always positive. No solution.How about p=1/3. Then c=1 -2*(1/3)=1 -2/3=1/3. Then equation becomes:2*(1/3)/( (1/3)^2 + q^2 ) +3 =1. Wait, 1/c =1/(1/3)=3. So:(2/3)/(1/9 + q^2) +3 =1 =&gt; (2/3)/(1/9 + q^2) =-2. Left side is positive (since denominator is positive), right side is negative. No solution.This seems not working. Maybe there&#39;s no solution with c≠1. Alternatively, let&#39;s try another approach. Let&#39;s set q=1, and find p such that:2p / (p^2 +1) +1/(1 -2p) =1.Let me denote this as:(2p)/(p² +1) + 1/(1 -2p) =1.Multiply both sides by (p² +1)(1 -2p):2p(1 -2p) + (p² +1) = (p² +1)(1 -2p).Expand left side:2p -4p² +p² +1 = -3p² +2p +1.Right side:(p² +1)(1 -2p) = p²(1 -2p) +1*(1 -2p) = p² -2p³ +1 -2p.Set left = right:-3p² +2p +1 = -2p³ + p² -2p +1.Bring all terms to left:-3p² +2p +1 +2p³ -p² +2p -1 =0.Combine like terms:2p³ -4p² +4p =0.Factor:2p(p² -2p +2)=0.Solutions:p=0, or p² -2p +2=0. For the quadratic, discriminant is 4 -8= -4, so p= [2 ± 2i]/2=1±i.So real solutions are p=0. If p=0, then c=1 -0=1. Then a=0 +i, b=0 -i. So variables would be a=i, b=-i, c=1. Then reciprocals:1/i +1/(-i) +1/1 = -i +i +1=1. So this works, but here c=1. So even in this complex case, one variable is 1. Therefore, even when allowing complex numbers, there must be at least one variable equal to 1.Therefore, in all cases, whether variables are real or complex, at least one of x, y, z must equal 1. Therefore, option A is correct.But wait, the problem didn&#39;t specify if x, y, z are allowed to be complex. If the problem assumes x, y, z are real numbers (which is typical unless stated otherwise), then our previous real-number examples show that there are solutions where exactly one variable is 1, and others are not. Hence, option A holds: at least one equals 1.But let me check if there&#39;s a case where none of x, y, z is 1. Wait, in all the examples we tried, even with complex numbers, at least one variable is 1. So according to the mathematical derivation, if you have x + y + z =1 and 1/x +1/y +1/z =1, then at least one variable must be 1. Therefore, option A is correct.Wait, but the answer options are:A) At least one equals 1B) All equal 1C) None equal 1D) None of the above.But according to our analysis, option A is correct. However, the problem is in Chinese, and the options might have nuances. But based on the given translations, option A states &quot;x, y, z at least one equals 1&quot;, which we have confirmed is true. However, looking back at the problem statement, there might be a typo or misinterpretation. Wait, the original problem says:(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{x + y + z} =1)This can be read as two separate equations: (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} =1) and (frac{1}{x + y + z} =1), which implies (x + y + z =1). So that&#39;s how I interpreted earlier.Therefore, given that in all solutions, at least one variable is 1, option A should be correct. However, the answer given in some sources might be D, but according to our analysis, A is correct. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, but let me check again. If we suppose variables can be complex, but in the cubic equation we saw that even then, there must be a variable equal to 1. But maybe if variables are allowed to be equal to each other, but not 1. Wait, for example, if x = y = z. Then x + x + x =1 =&gt; 3x=1 =&gt;x=1/3. Then 1/x +1/x +1/x =3/(1/3)=9≠1. So that&#39;s not a solution.Alternatively, if two variables are equal. Suppose x = y, then 2x + z =1 =&gt; z=1 -2x. Then reciprocals: 2/x +1/z=1. Substitute z=1 -2x:2/x + 1/(1 -2x)=1. Multiply by x(1 -2x):2(1 -2x) +x = x(1 -2x)2 -4x +x =x -2x²2 -3x =x -2x²2 -4x +2x²=0Divide by 2:x² -2x +1=0 =&gt;(x -1)^2=0 =&gt;x=1. Then z=1 -2(1)= -1. So x=y=1, z=-1. Again, x and y are 1.Hence, even when assuming variables are equal, the only solutions require at least one variable to be 1.Therefore, based on all these cases, option A must be correct. However, the problem&#39;s options are:A) At least one equals 1.B) All equal 1.C) None equal 1.D) None of the above.But according to our analysis, option A is correct, but the answer given in some similar problems might be D. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.Wait, in the case where variables can be complex, even though mathematically there must be at least one variable equal to 1 (as shown by the cubic equation), but maybe the problem assumes variables are real numbers. In that case, at least one variable is 1, so option A is correct. However, in the answer options, if &quot;at least one equals 1&quot; is considered, but the problem might have constraints not considered. Wait, but in the problem statement, it&#39;s not specified whether variables are real or complex. However, in standard competitions like the SAT or Olympiads, variables are usually real unless stated otherwise.Therefore, given that in real numbers, there must be at least one variable equal to 1, option A should be correct. However, the original problem might have answer D. Let me verify with another approach.Suppose we have x + y + z =1 and 1/x +1/y +1/z=1. Let me express 1/x +1/y +1/z = (xy + yz + zx)/xyz=1. So (xy + yz + zx)=xyz.So, we have two equations:1. x + y + z =12. xy + yz + zx =xyzLet me consider variables shifted by 1. Let me set a =x -1, b =y -1, c =z -1. Then x = a +1, y =b +1, z =c +1.Substitute into equation 1:(a +1) + (b +1) + (c +1)=1 =&gt; a + b + c +3=1 =&gt; a + b + c =-2.Equation 2:(xy + yz + zx) =xyz.Compute each term:xy = (a +1)(b +1)=ab +a +b +1Similarly, yz= (b +1)(c +1)=bc +b +c +1zx= (c +1)(a +1)=ca +c +a +1So sum:xy + yz + zx =ab + bc + ca + 2(a + b + c) +3.But a + b + c =-2, so:xy + yz + zx =ab + bc + ca +2*(-2) +3= ab + bc + ca -1.Now, xyz= (a +1)(b +1)(c +1)= abc +ab + bc + ca +a + b + c +1.Substitute a + b + c =-2:xyz= abc +ab + bc + ca -2 +1=abc +ab + bc + ca -1.So equation 2 becomes:ab + bc + ca -1 = abc +ab + bc + ca -1.Subtract ab + bc + ca -1 from both sides:0=abc.Thus, abc=0. Therefore, at least one of a, b, c is zero. Which implies at least one of x, y, z is 1 (since a=0 =&gt;x=1, etc.). Therefore, this algebraic manipulation shows that at least one of x, y, z must be 1. Therefore, option A is correct.Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But why does option D exist? Maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is D, but according to this analysis, it&#39;s A. However, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement.Wait, let me check the equations again. The problem says:(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{x + y + z} =1)So this can be interpreted as (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} =1) and (frac{1}{x + y + z}=1), which gives x + y + z=1.But in the case where variables can be complex, as we saw, even if they are complex, one variable must be 1. But maybe in the problem&#39;s context, variables are real numbers. Therefore, in real numbers, at least one variable is 1, so option A is correct. So why would the answer be D?Wait, perhaps there is a case where none of the variables is 1. Wait, but according to the previous analysis, that&#39;s impossible. For example, take the equation derived above: abc=0, which in the shifted variables means at least one of x, y, z is 1. Therefore, if abc=0, then a=0 or b=0 or c=0, hence x=1 or y=1 or z=1. Therefore, regardless of other variables, at least one must be 1. Therefore, option A must hold.Therefore, the answer is A. However, looking at similar problems, sometimes these problems have answer D when there&#39;s a trick. Wait, but in the shifted variables, we see that abc=0 is a necessary condition. Hence, option A is correct.Therefore, I think the correct answer is A. But since the options are given as (A) at least one equals 1, (B) all equal 1, (C) none equal 1, (D) none of the above.But wait, if the answer is A, then the correct choice is A. But maybe the test problem has answer D, but according to our analysis, A is correct. Let me check once again with specific numbers.Take x=1, y=2, z=-2. Then x + y + z=1 +2 -2=1. Reciprocals:1 +0.5 -0.5=1. So this works. Here, x=1, so at least one is 1.Take x=1, y=3, z=-3. Then sum=1, reciprocals=1 +1/3 -1/3=1. Also works.Take x=1, y=1, z=-1. Then sum=1 +1 -1=1. Reciprocals=1 +1 -1=1. This also works. So in this case, two variables are 1.But we can also have two variables being 1. For example, x=1, y=1, z=-1. So at least one equals 1, which is covered in option A. However, option B says all equal 1, which is not possible because sum would be 3, not 1.Therefore, even in cases where two variables are 1, option A holds. So unless there&#39;s a case where none is 1, which we have proven impossible, option A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A. But the given options include D. Maybe there is a translation error or a mistake in the problem.Wait, but the problem in Chinese might have different nuances. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the shifting variables.Wait, let me verify the shifting variables approach again.We set a =x -1, b =y -1, c =z -1. Therefore, x =a +1, etc.Then x + y + z =1 implies a + b + c =-2.Then we transformed the equation xy + yz + zx =xyz into abc=0.Therefore, at least one of a, b, c is 0, hence at least one of x, y, z is 1. Therefore, this is a conclusive proof that in any solution (real or complex), at least one variable is 1. Therefore, option A must be correct.Therefore, the answer should be A. However, if the options are mistranslated or if there&#39;s a trick, but based on mathematical analysis, A is correct. Therefore, I think the correct answer is A.But wait, in the original problem statement, the equations are written as:Oar: (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{x + y + z} =1)This can be interpreted as two separate equations: (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} =1) and (frac{1}{x + y + z}=1), hence (x + y + z=1). So my previous analysis holds.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{x + y + z}), and this is equal to 1. So both sides equal 1. That is the same as before.Therefore, regardless, the conclusion is the same: at least one variable must be 1. Therefore, the answer is A. But the option D says none of the above are correct. Wait, but according to our analysis, option A is correct, so D is not. Unless there&#39;s a mistake.Wait, let me check with another example where perhaps multiple variables are 1, but it&#39;s not necessary. For example, x=1, y=2, z=-2. Here only x is 1. Or x=1, y=1, z=-1. Here two variables are 1. So in some solutions, more than one variable is 1, but at least one is necessary.Therefore, option A is correct. Therefore, the answer is A. However, in some sources, similar problems have answer D when there&#39;s a trick. But in this case, the algebra clearly shows that option A is correct.Perhaps the confusion arises from thinking that &quot;at least one equals 1&quot; might mean exactly one, but in mathematics, &quot;at least one&quot; includes the possibility of more. So if in some solutions more than one variable is 1, but in others only one, option A still holds.Therefore, based on this, the answer should be A. However, let me check once again for any possible mistakes.Suppose we consider the system:x + y + z =11/x +1/y +1/z =1Let me cross-multiply the second equation:(yz + xz + xy)/xyz =1 =&gt; yz + xz + xy =xyzNow, using the first equation x + y + z =1. Let&#39;s rearrange the equation:xyz -xy -yz -zx =0xyz -xy -yz -zx +x + y + z -1= x + y + z -1=0Wait, substituting x + y + z=1, so:xyz -xy -yz -zx +1 -1=xyz -xy -yz -zx=0.Therefore, xyz=xy + yz + zx.From here, we can use the substitution from before. Let me factor this equation.xyz -xy -yz -zx=0 =&gt; xy(z -1) - z(y +x)=0. Not sure.Alternatively, add 1 to both sides:xyz -xy -yz -zx +1 =1But x + y + z=1. Not sure.Alternatively, let me consider the equation xyz =xy + yz + zx.Divide both sides by xyz (assuming x,y,z ≠0):1 =1/z +1/x +1/y.But wait, 1/x +1/y +1/z=1, which is the same as the given equation. So this doesn&#39;t help.Alternatively, write in terms of variables:Let’s denote S=1, P=xyz, Q=xy + yz + zx.We have Q=P.Also, for three variables x, y, z, we have the identity:x^3 - Sx^2 + Qx - P=0. But since S=1, Q=P,This becomes x^3 -x^2 + Px -P=0.Factor as x^2(x -1) +P(x -1)= (x -1)(x^2 + P)=0.Therefore, the solutions are x=1 or x=±√(-P).Thus, if variables are real, then x=1 or x=±√(-P). But if x=1 is a root, then the other variables are roots of x^2 +P=0. If P is negative, then x=±√(-P) are real, otherwise complex. But if x=1 is a root, then even if other roots are complex, one variable is 1. If variables are complex, then x=1 must still be a root as per the equation.Therefore, regardless, at least one variable is 1. Therefore, answer A is correct.Therefore, after thorough analysis, I believe the correct answer is A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;Given the equations (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1) and (frac{1}{x + y + z} = 1), we start by noting that the second equation implies (x + y + z = 1).We need to determine if at least one of (x), (y), or (z) must equal 1 (Option A), all equal 1 (Option B), none equal 1 (Option C), or none of the above (Option D).1. Option B Check: If (x = y = z = 1), their sum would be 3, contradicting (x + y + z = 1). Thus, Option B is incorrect.2. Option A Check: Suppose one variable is 1, say (x = 1). Then (1 + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 1) simplifies to (frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = 0). Given (x + y + z = 1), we have (y + z = 0), leading to (z = -y). Substituting back, (frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{-y} = 0), which works. Thus, at least one variable can be 1, and others can be non-1 values.3. General Case Analysis: Using algebra, we factor the cubic equation derived from the given conditions. The roots must satisfy (t^3 - t^2 + Pt - P = 0), which factors to ((t - 1)(t^2 + P) = 0). This implies one root is 1, and the others are complex or real. For real numbers, at least one root must be 1. For complex numbers, if coefficients are real, one real root (1) is required, making other roots complex conjugates.4. Shifting Variables: Setting (a = x - 1), (b = y - 1), (c = z - 1), we derive (abc = 0), meaning at least one of (a), (b), or (c) is 0, implying (x), (y), or (z) is 1.Thus, regardless of whether variables are real or complex, at least one must be 1. Therefore, Option A is correct.[boxed{A}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>frac{5}{mathrm{~A}}</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-214d4dc7 data-v-2626c2a0><div class="review" data-v-2626c2a0><div class="review-title" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>❓:</span>Example 7 Let p_{k}(x)=underbrace{left(cdotsleft(left((x-2)^{2}-2right)^{2}-2right)^{2}-cdots-2right)^{2}}_{k uparrow}, k is any given natural number, try to find the coefficient of the x^{2} term in p_{k}(x) with k parentheses.</div><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out the coefficient of the x² term in this polynomial p_k(x). The problem says that p_k(x) is defined with k parentheses, each time squaring the previous expression and subtracting 2. So, starting with (x - 2)² - 2, then squaring that result and subtracting 2 again, and repeating this process k times. Hmm, this seems recursive. Maybe I can find a pattern by looking at the first few polynomials and see how the x² coefficient changes each time.Let me start with k = 1. Then p₁(x) = (x - 2)² - 2. Let&#39;s expand that:(x - 2)² = x² - 4x + 4. Then subtract 2: x² - 4x + 2. So the coefficient of x² here is 1. Okay, that&#39;s straightforward.Now for k = 2. p₂(x) = [p₁(x)]² - 2 = (x² - 4x + 2)² - 2. Let&#39;s expand that square:First, (x² - 4x + 2)². Let me compute that term by term. The square of x² is x⁴. Then the cross terms: 2*(x²)*(-4x) = -8x³. Then 2*(x²)*(2) = 4x². Then the square of (-4x) is 16x². Then cross term between -4x and 2: 2*(-4x)*(2) = -16x. Finally, the square of 2 is 4. So adding all these up:x⁴ - 8x³ + (4x² + 16x²) + (-16x) + 4 = x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 4. Then subtract 2: x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2. So the coefficient of x² here is 20.Hmm, so from k=1 to k=2, the x² coefficient went from 1 to 20. Let&#39;s do k=3 to see if there&#39;s a pattern.p₃(x) = [p₂(x)]² - 2 = (x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2)² - 2. Expanding this seems complicated, but maybe I don&#39;t need to compute all terms. Since we only care about the x² term in the final result, maybe there&#39;s a smarter way to track how the x² term is generated in each step.Wait, when we square a polynomial, the x² term in the result can come from two places: either squaring the x term of the original polynomial or multiplying two constant terms, or cross terms between x² and lower degree terms. Wait, actually, let&#39;s think more carefully.Suppose I have a polynomial Q(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_2 x² + a_1 x + a_0. Then Q(x)² will have a term a_2² x⁴ + 2a_1 a_3 x⁴ + ... but actually, when squaring, the coefficient of x² in Q(x)² is 2a_1 a_0 + a_0²? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. To get an x² term when multiplying Q(x) by Q(x), the pairs of terms whose exponents add up to 2. So, possible combinations are:- a_0 * a_2 x²- a_1 x * a_1 x = a_1² x²- a_2 x² * a_0But in general, for the x² term in Q(x)², the coefficient would be 2a_0 a_2 + a_1². Because the cross terms between x⁰ and x², and x¹ and x¹. So the coefficient of x² in Q(x)² is 2a₀a₂ + a₁².Then, since p_k(x) = [p_{k-1}(x)]² - 2, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) would be equal to (coefficient of x² in [p_{k-1}(x)]²) minus 0, since subtracting 2 only affects the constant term. So, if I can find the coefficient of x² in [p_{k-1}(x)]², which is 2a₀a₂ + a₁², where a₀, a₁, a₂ are the constant term, x term, and x² term of p_{k-1}(x). Then this becomes a recursive formula.Therefore, if I denote for each k:Let c_k be the coefficient of x² in p_k(x).Let b_k be the coefficient of x in p_k(x).Let a_k be the constant term in p_k(x).Then, c_k = 2a_{k-1} c_{k-1} + b_{k-1}².Similarly, but maybe we also need to track b_k and a_k as well, since they influence the next term.Wait, but maybe the problem is only asking for c_k, but perhaps we need to track how a_{k}, b_{k}, c_{k} relate.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a pattern that can be found for c_k by computing the first few terms and then deducing a general formula.We already know:For k=1:p₁(x) = (x - 2)² - 2 = x² - 4x + 2.Thus, a₁ = 2, b₁ = -4, c₁ = 1.Wait, hold on: coefficient of x² in p₁(x) is 1, coefficient of x is -4, constant term 2.Wait, but when we computed p₂(x), which was [p₁(x)]² - 2, then the coefficient of x² was 20. Let&#39;s see if that matches the formula c₂ = 2a₁ c₁ + b₁².So 2*a₁*c₁ + b₁² = 2*2*1 + (-4)^2 = 4 + 16 = 20. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So that formula works. Then c₂ = 20.Similarly, for k=3, c₃ = 2*a₂*c₂ + b₂². But we need to know a₂ and b₂.Wait, but to compute a₂ and b₂, maybe we need more information. Because when we square p₁(x) and subtract 2, the constant term a₂ is (a₁)^2 - 2, right? Because the constant term of [p_{k-1}(x)]² is (a_{k-1})², then subtract 2. So a_k = (a_{k-1})² - 2.Similarly, the coefficient of x in [p_{k-1}(x)]² is 2*a_{k-1}*b_{k-1}, because when squaring, the cross term between the constant term and the x term. Then since p_k(x) = [p_{k-1}(x)]² - 2, the coefficient of x in p_k(x) is the same as the coefficient of x in [p_{k-1}(x)]². So b_k = 2*a_{k-1}*b_{k-1}.Similarly, as we saw before, c_k = 2*a_{k-1}*c_{k-1} + (b_{k-1})².Therefore, we can set up recursive relations:a_k = (a_{k-1})² - 2b_k = 2*a_{k-1}*b_{k-1}c_k = 2*a_{k-1}*c_{k-1} + (b_{k-1})²With initial conditions:For k=1:a₁ = 2 (constant term of p₁(x))b₁ = -4 (coefficient of x in p₁(x))c₁ = 1 (coefficient of x² in p₁(x))So let&#39;s compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern.For k=1:a₁ = 2b₁ = -4c₁ = 1For k=2:a₂ = (a₁)^2 - 2 = 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2b₂ = 2*a₁*b₁ = 2*2*(-4) = -16c₂ = 2*a₁*c₁ + (b₁)^2 = 2*2*1 + (-4)^2 = 4 + 16 = 20For k=3:a₃ = (a₂)^2 - 2 = 2² - 2 = 2Wait, a₃ is also 2? Interesting.Similarly, b₃ = 2*a₂*b₂ = 2*2*(-16) = -64c₃ = 2*a₂*c₂ + (b₂)^2 = 2*2*20 + (-16)^2 = 80 + 256 = 336Wait, so c₃ = 336.For k=4:a₄ = (a₃)^2 - 2 = 2² - 2 = 2Same as before. So a_k remains 2 for k ≥1?Wait, a₁=2, a₂=2, a₃=2, a₄=2... So a_k is always 2? That seems to be the case. Because each time a_k = (a_{k-1})² - 2, and since a_{k-1} = 2, then a_k = 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. So yes, this is a fixed point. So a_k = 2 for all k ≥1. That&#39;s interesting.Similarly, the sequence for b_k:b₁ = -4b₂ = -16b₃ = -64b₄ = 2*a₃*b₃ = 2*2*(-64) = -256So each time, b_k = 2*2*b_{k-1} = 4*b_{k-1}. So starting from b₁=-4, each subsequent term is multiplied by 4. Therefore, b_k = -4*(4)^{k-1} = -4^{k}. Because:For k=1: -4^1 = -4k=2: -4^2 = -16k=3: -4^3 = -64Yes, so b_k = -4^{k}Now, for c_k:We have c₁ = 1c₂ = 2*2*1 + (-4)^2 = 4 + 16 = 20c₃ = 2*2*20 + (-16)^2 = 80 + 256 = 336c₄ = 2*2*336 + (-64)^2 = 1344 + 4096 = 5440Wait, so c₄=5440. Let&#39;s see if we can find a pattern here.Looking at the sequence c₁=1, c₂=20, c₃=336, c₄=5440...Hmm, not obvious. Let&#39;s see the ratios between terms:20 /1 = 20336 /20 = 16.85440 /336 ≈ 16.190...Not a consistent ratio. Alternatively, maybe the differences:20 -1=19336 -20=3165440 -336=5104Not helpful. Alternatively, let&#39;s look at the recursive formula:c_k = 2*a_{k-1}*c_{k-1} + (b_{k-1})²Since we know that a_{k-1} = 2 and b_{k-1} = -4^{k-1}So substituting:c_k = 2*2*c_{k-1} + (-4^{k-1})² = 4*c_{k-1} + 16^{k-1}Ah, this is a linear recurrence relation. So c_k = 4*c_{k-1} + 16^{k-1}With c₁=1Therefore, we can solve this recurrence relation.First, let&#39;s write the recurrence:c_k - 4*c_{k-1} = 16^{k-1}This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.The homogeneous equation is c_k - 4*c_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 4 = 0, so r=4. Hence, the homogeneous solution is C*4^k.For the particular solution, the nonhomogeneous term is 16^{k-1} = (16)^{k-1} = (16)^{k} /16. Since 16 is a constant, but note that 16 = 4², so 16 is not a root of the homogeneous equation (the root is 4). Therefore, we can try a particular solution of the form A*16^{k}.Let&#39;s assume a particular solution of the form c_p(k) = A*16^k.Substituting into the recurrence:c_p(k) - 4*c_p(k-1) = 16^{k-1}A*16^k -4*A*16^{k-1} = 16^{k-1}Divide both sides by 16^{k-1}:16*A -4*A =112*A =1 =&gt; A=1/12Therefore, the general solution is c_k = homogeneous + particular = C*4^k + (1/12)*16^kNow apply the initial condition. For k=1, c₁=1.So:1 = C*4^1 + (1/12)*16^11 = 4C + (16/12)Simplify:16/12 = 4/3, so:1 = 4C + 4/3Subtract 4/3:1 - 4/3 = 4C =&gt; (-1/3) = 4C =&gt; C= -1/12Therefore, the general solution is:c_k = (-1/12)*4^k + (1/12)*16^kFactor out 1/12:c_k = (1/12)*(16^k - 4^k)Alternatively, since 16 = 4², so 16^k = 4^{2k}, but maybe leave it as 16^k -4^k over 12.Alternatively, factor 4^k:c_k = (4^k /12)*(4^k -1)But 4^k /12 = (4^{k -1} *4)/12 = 4^{k -1}/3. Wait, that might not help.Wait, 16^k -4^k = 4^{2k} -4^k =4^k(4^k -1). So:c_k = (4^k(4^k -1))/12 = (4^{k-1}(4^k -1))/3But perhaps simplifying:c_k = (16^k -4^k)/12Yes, this is straightforward.So, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.Let me verify this with the previous terms.For k=1: (16^1 -4^1)/12 = (16 -4)/12 =12/12=1. Correct.For k=2: (16² -4²)/12 = (256 -16)/12=240/12=20. Correct.For k=3: (16³ -4³)/12=(4096 -64)/12=4032/12=336. Correct.For k=4: (16⁴ -4⁴)/12=(65536 -256)/12=65280/12=5440. Which matches our earlier calculation. Perfect.Therefore, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, this can be written as (4^{2k} -4^k)/12 =4^k(4^k -1)/12= (4^{k} -1)/3 *4^k /4= but maybe not necessary.Alternatively, factor out 4^k:(16^k -4^k)/12 =4^k(4^k -1)/12= (4^k -1)/3 *4^k /4= Hmm, not sure if it&#39;s simpler.But the answer is (16^k -4^k)/12. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify that.Note that 16^k -4^k = (4^2)^k -4^k =4^{2k} -4^k=4^k(4^k -1). Therefore, (16^k -4^k)/12= [4^k(4^k -1)]/12= (4^k -1)/3 *4^k/4= Hmm, not really. Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 4:[4^k(4^k -1)]/12= [4^{k-1}(4^k -1)]/3.But either form is acceptable. The original expression (16^k -4^k)/12 is correct.Alternatively, factoring 4^k, it&#39;s 4^k*(4^k -1)/12. But perhaps the simplest way is (16^k - 4^k)/12.Alternatively, we can write this as (4^{2k} -4^k)/12.But likely, the answer is (16^k -4^k)/12. Let me check for k=1,2,3,4 again:k=1: (16 -4)/12=12/12=1 ✔️k=2: (256 -16)/12=240/12=20 ✔️k=3: (4096 -64)/12=4032/12=336 ✔️k=4: (65536 -256)/12=65280/12=5440 ✔️Yes, all correct.Therefore, the coefficient of the x² term in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, this can be simplified as:(16^k -4^k)/12 = (4^{2k} -4^k)/12 =4^k(4^k -1)/12 = (4^k -1)/3 *4^k/4= (4^k -1)/3 *4^{k-1}But perhaps the original expression is the most straightforward.Thus, the answer is (16^k -4^k)/12.Final AnswerThe coefficient of the (x^{2}) term in (p_{k}(x)) is boxed{dfrac{4^k(4^k - 1)}{12}}.Alternatively, simplifying (dfrac{16^k - 4^k}{12}) gives the same result, so another boxed form could be boxed{dfrac{16^k - 4^k}{12}}.But since the problem might prefer one form over the other. Given that both are equivalent, but perhaps the first form is more factored. Let me check:(16^k -4^k)/12 =4^k*(4^k -1)/12= (4^k*(4^k -1))/12= (4^{2k} -4^k)/12. Either is acceptable, but perhaps the second form is simpler. The assistant should pick one. Since the user might prefer the factored form, but both are correct. However, in the thought process, we arrived at (16^k -4^k)/12. So maybe that&#39;s the answer. Let me check the problem statement: &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. Since both forms are correct, but perhaps the assistant would choose boxed{dfrac{4^k(4^k - 1)}{12}} as it factors out 4^k, which may be considered more simplified. Alternatively, the assistant might prefer the form with exponents as in the recurrence, which is 16^k. But since the problem mentions &quot;with k parentheses&quot;, it&#39;s neutral. However, when the user provided the example, they used LaTeX, so both forms are acceptable. But given that in the problem statement, the process starts with (x-2)^2 -2, which is 4=2^2, leading to 16=4^2, but in the recurrence, the key terms are 4 and 16. Therefore, using 16^k and 4^k is clearer. So I think the answer is boxed{dfrac{16^k - 4^k}{12}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the coefficient of the (x^2) term in (p_k(x)), we start by analyzing the recursive structure of the polynomial. Each polynomial (p_k(x)) is defined as (left(p_{k-1}(x)right)^2 - 2). We denote the coefficient of (x^2) in (p_k(x)) as (c_k), the coefficient of (x) as (b_k), and the constant term as (a_k).We observe the following recursive relations:1. (a_k = (a_{k-1})^2 - 2)2. (b_k = 2a_{k-1}b_{k-1})3. (c_k = 2a_{k-1}c_{k-1} + (b_{k-1})^2)Starting with the initial polynomial (p_1(x) = (x - 2)^2 - 2 = x^2 - 4x + 2), we have:- (a_1 = 2)- (b_1 = -4)- (c_1 = 1)For subsequent values of (k), we find:- (a_k = 2) for all (k geq 1) (since (a_{k-1} = 2) is a fixed point)- (b_k = -4^k) (since (b_k = 2 cdot 2 cdot b_{k-1} = 4b_{k-1}) with (b_1 = -4))- (c_k) follows the recurrence relation (c_k = 4c_{k-1} + 16^{k-1})Solving the recurrence relation for (c_k), we find the general solution:[ c_k = frac{16^k - 4^k}{12} ]Thus, the coefficient of the (x^2) term in (p_k(x)) is:[boxed{dfrac{16^k - 4^k}{12}}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the coefficient of the x² term in this polynomial p_k(x). The polynomial is defined with k parentheses, each time squaring the previous expression and subtracting 2. Let me try to understand what exactly is going on here.First, the problem defines p_k(x) as a repeated process. Starting with (x - 2), then squaring it and subtracting 2, then squaring the result and subtracting 2 again, and so on, k times. So, each step involves taking the previous polynomial, squaring it, subtracting 2, and repeating this process. The example given is for k parentheses, so if k is 1, it&#39;s just (x - 2)² - 2, right? And for k=2, it would be ((x - 2)² - 2)² - 2, and so on. So each time, we add another squaring and subtracting 2 operation.The question is asking for the coefficient of the x² term in p_k(x). Since each operation modifies the polynomial, the coefficients change with each iteration. My goal is to find a pattern or a recursive formula that can give me the coefficient of x² after k iterations.Let me start by working through the first few cases manually to see if I can spot a pattern.For k=1:p₁(x) = ((x - 2)²) - 2First, compute (x - 2)²: that&#39;s x² - 4x + 4.Subtracting 2 gives: x² - 4x + 4 - 2 = x² - 4x + 2.So here, the coefficient of x² is 1, the coefficient of x is -4, and the constant term is 2.For k=2:p₂(x) = (p₁(x))² - 2We need to square x² - 4x + 2 and then subtract 2.First, square x² - 4x + 2:(x² - 4x + 2)(x² - 4x + 2)Multiply term by term:x² * x² = x⁴x² * (-4x) = -4x³x² * 2 = 2x²(-4x) * x² = -4x³(-4x) * (-4x) = 16x²(-4x) * 2 = -8x2 * x² = 2x²2 * (-4x) = -8x2 * 2 = 4Now, combine like terms:x⁴ + (-4x³ -4x³) + (2x² + 16x² + 2x²) + (-8x -8x) + 4Simplify:x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 4Subtract 2: x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2So, p₂(x) is x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2. The coefficient of x² here is 20.For k=3:p₃(x) = (p₂(x))² - 2This seems like it&#39;s going to get complicated quickly, but maybe we don&#39;t need the entire polynomial. Since we&#39;re only interested in the x² term, perhaps there&#39;s a way to track how the coefficient of x² evolves with each iteration without computing all the other terms.Let me think. When we square a polynomial, the x² term in the result comes from two places: the product of the constant term with the x² term, the product of the x term with the x term, and the product of the x² term with the constant term. But wait, in general, when you square a polynomial, the coefficient of x² in the square is equal to 2*(constant term)*(x² term) + (x term)^2. Let me verify that.Suppose we have a polynomial q(x) = a + b x + c x² + ... . Then q(x)² will have a term a² for the constant term, 2ab x for the x term, (2ac + b²) x² for the x² term, and so on. Wait, yes, so the coefficient of x² in q(x)² is 2ac + b². So in general, if we denote the coefficients as follows: q(x) = c₀ + c₁x + c₂x² + ... + c_n x^n, then the coefficient of x² in q(x)² is 2c₀c₂ + (c₁)².Therefore, if we can track the constant term (c₀), the coefficient of x (c₁), and the coefficient of x² (c₂) at each step, we can compute the next c₂ without having to compute the entire polynomial. Then, after squaring, we subtract 2, which only affects the constant term.So, perhaps we can model the evolution of these coefficients recursively. Let me formalize this.Let’s denote that at step k, the polynomial p_k(x) has coefficients c₀(k) for the constant term, c₁(k) for the x term, and c₂(k) for the x² term. Then, when we square p_k(x) to get p_{k+1}(x) before subtracting 2, the squared polynomial will have coefficients as follows:The constant term of the squared polynomial will be [c₀(k)]².The coefficient of x in the squared polynomial will be 2c₀(k)c₁(k).The coefficient of x² in the squared polynomial will be 2c₀(k)c₂(k) + [c₁(k)]².Then, after subtracting 2 to form p_{k+1}(x), the new constant term becomes [c₀(k)]² - 2, the coefficient of x remains 2c₀(k)c₁(k), and the coefficient of x² remains 2c₀(k)c₂(k) + [c₁(k)]².Therefore, we can write recurrence relations for c₀(k), c₁(k), and c₂(k):c₀(k+1) = [c₀(k)]² - 2,c₁(k+1) = 2c₀(k)c₁(k),c₂(k+1) = 2c₀(k)c₂(k) + [c₁(k)]².Our goal is to find c₂(k) for any natural number k. Let&#39;s check if this works with our previous calculations.For k=1:From before, p₁(x) = x² - 4x + 2, so c₀(1) = 2, c₁(1) = -4, c₂(1) = 1.For k=2:c₀(2) = [c₀(1)]² - 2 = 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.Wait, but earlier when we calculated p₂(x), the constant term was 2, which matches.c₁(2) = 2c₀(1)c₁(1) = 2*2*(-4) = -16. But in p₂(x), the coefficient of x is -16x? Wait, no. Wait in p₂(x), after squaring and subtracting 2, we had x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2, so the coefficient of x is -16. But according to the recurrence, c₁(2) = 2*2*(-4) = -16. So that matches.Then c₂(2) = 2c₀(1)c₂(1) + [c₁(1)]² = 2*2*1 + (-4)^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, which matches the coefficient of x² in p₂(x).So the recurrence relations work.Now, let&#39;s compute for k=3:c₀(3) = [c₀(2)]² - 2 = 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.c₁(3) = 2c₀(2)c₁(2) = 2*2*(-16) = -64.c₂(3) = 2c₀(2)c₂(2) + [c₁(2)]² = 2*2*20 + (-16)^2 = 80 + 256 = 336.Therefore, the coefficient of x² in p₃(x) is 336. Let me verify by computing p₃(x):p₃(x) = (p₂(x))² - 2 = (x⁴ - 8x³ + 20x² - 16x + 2)² - 2.Calculating that would be tedious, but according to the recurrence, the coefficient of x² is 336. Let&#39;s check if the recurrence holds:From p₂(x) = x⁴ -8x³ +20x² -16x +2. Squaring this, the x² term in the square will come from:- The product of the constant term (2) with the x² term (20x²) multiplied by 2 (since constant term * x² term and x² term * constant term), so 2*2*20 = 80.- The square of the x term (-16x), so (-16)^2 = 256.Adding those gives 80 + 256 = 336. Then subtracting 2 only affects the constant term, so the coefficient of x² remains 336. Therefore, it checks out.Similarly, for k=4:c₀(4) = [c₀(3)]² - 2 = 2² - 2 = 2 again.c₁(4) = 2c₀(3)c₁(3) = 2*2*(-64) = -256.c₂(4) = 2c₀(3)c₂(3) + [c₁(3)]² = 2*2*336 + (-64)^2 = 1344 + 4096 = 5440.So the coefficient of x² in p₄(x) is 5440.It seems that c₀(k) is always 2 for k ≥ 1. Wait, let&#39;s check:c₀(1) = 2c₀(2) = 2² - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2c₀(3) = 2² - 2 = 2Same for c₀(4), so indeed, c₀(k) = 2 for all k ≥ 1. That&#39;s interesting. So regardless of k, the constant term is always 2. That&#39;s because each time, we square the previous polynomial (which ends up having a constant term c₀(k)), then subtract 2. But when we square a polynomial with constant term 2, the new constant term is 2² = 4, and subtracting 2 gives 2. So, it&#39;s a fixed point. Therefore, c₀(k) = 2 for all k ≥ 1.Therefore, in the recurrence relations:c₀(k) = 2 for all k ≥ 1.Then, c₁(k+1) = 2*2*c₁(k) = 4c₁(k). So c₁(k) is multiplied by 4 each time.Similarly, c₂(k+1) = 2*2*c₂(k) + [c₁(k)]² = 4c₂(k) + [c₁(k)]².Therefore, we can model c₁(k) and c₂(k) independently, with c₁(k) being a geometric sequence multiplied by 4 each time, and c₂(k) being a more complex sequence that depends on both c₂(k-1) and [c₁(k-1)]².Given that, let&#39;s try to find a general formula for c₁(k) and c₂(k).Starting with c₁(k):From k=1: c₁(1) = -4k=2: c₁(2) = 4 * c₁(1) = 4*(-4) = -16k=3: c₁(3) = 4 * c₁(2) = 4*(-16) = -64k=4: c₁(4) = 4 * c₁(3) = 4*(-64) = -256So, c₁(k) = -4^k. Let&#39;s check:For k=1: -4^1 = -4 ✔️k=2: -4^2 = -16 ✔️k=3: -4^3 = -64 ✔️Yes, so c₁(k) = -4^k.Therefore, [c₁(k)]² = ( -4^k )² = 16^k.Now, for c₂(k):We have the recurrence:c₂(k+1) = 4c₂(k) + 16^{k}With the initial condition c₂(1) = 1.So, we can write this as a linear recurrence:c₂(k+1) - 4c₂(k) = 16^{k}This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can use the method of solving linear recurrences.First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is:c₂(k+1) - 4c₂(k) = 0The characteristic equation is r - 4 = 0 ⇒ r = 4. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:c₂^{(h)}(k) = A*4^kWhere A is a constant.Next, find a particular solution. The nonhomogeneous term is 16^k. Since 16 is not a root of the characteristic equation (the root was 4), we can try a particular solution of the form c₂^{(p)}(k) = B*16^k.Plugging into the recurrence:c₂^{(p)}(k+1) - 4c₂^{(p)}(k) = 16^{k}Left-hand side:B*16^{k+1} - 4*B*16^{k} = B*16*16^k - 4B*16^k = (16B - 4B)16^k = 12B*16^kSet equal to RHS:12B*16^k = 16^k ⇒ 12B = 1 ⇒ B = 1/12Therefore, the general solution is:c₂(k) = A*4^k + (1/12)*16^kNow, apply the initial condition to find A. The initial condition is c₂(1) = 1.But wait, the recurrence is defined for k ≥ 1, so c₂(1) is given, and we need to find c₂(k) for k ≥1. Let&#39;s adjust the indices accordingly.Wait, the recurrence is c₂(k+1) = 4c₂(k) + 16^k, with c₂(1) =1.So, for k=1: c₂(2) =4c₂(1) +16^1=4*1 +16=20, which matches our previous calculation.Similarly, for k=2: c₂(3)=4c₂(2) +16^2=4*20 +256=80+256=336, which also matches.So, the general solution is:c₂(k) = A*4^k + (1/12)*16^kWe need to find A such that when k=1, c₂(1)=1.Wait, but when k=1, in the general solution, k=1:c₂(1) = A*4^1 + (1/12)*16^1 =4A + (16/12)=4A + (4/3)Set equal to 1:4A + 4/3 =1 ⇒4A=1 -4/3= -1/3 ⇒A= (-1/3)/4= -1/12Therefore, the general solution is:c₂(k) = (-1/12)*4^k + (1/12)*16^k = (1/12)(16^k -4^k)Simplify:16^k = (4^2)^k =4^{2k}, so:c₂(k) = (1/12)(4^{2k} -4^k) = (4^{2k} -4^k)/12Alternatively, factor out 4^k:=4^k(4^k -1)/12But 4^k can be written as 2^{2k}, but maybe we can leave it as is.Therefore, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) is (4^{2k} -4^k)/12.Simplify this expression:4^{2k} is 16^k, so:(16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, factor 4^k:4^k(4^k -1)/12 = (4^k(4^k -1))/12.But perhaps we can write it as (4^k(4^k -1))/12.Alternatively, notice that 4^k = 2^{2k}, but maybe the answer is better presented in terms of 4^k.Alternatively, we can factor numerator and denominator:4^k(4^k -1)/12 = (4^k /4)*(4^{k} -1)/3 = 4^{k-1}(4^{k} -1)/3. Hmm, not sure if that&#39;s simpler.Alternatively, leave it as (16^k -4^k)/12.But let&#39;s check with our previous calculations to see which form matches.For k=1:(16^1 -4^1)/12=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1 ✔️For k=2:(16² -4²)/12=(256 -16)/12=240/12=20 ✔️For k=3:(16³ -4³)/12=(4096 -64)/12=4032/12=336 ✔️For k=4:(16⁴ -4⁴)/12=(65536 -256)/12=65280/12=5440 ✔️So yes, this formula works. Therefore, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, we can factor out 4^k:(4^k(4^k -1))/12. But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of 16^k and 4^k.But let me check if this can be simplified further. 16^k -4^k =4^{2k} -4^k=4^k(4^k -1). Then, 4^k(4^k -1)/12. So, it&#39;s equivalent.But maybe another way to express it is (4^{k}(4^{k} -1))/12.Alternatively, 4^{k} is 2^{2k}, so:(2^{2k}(2^{2k} -1))/12.But perhaps the answer is more straightforward as (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, writing 16^k as (4^2)^k =4^{2k}, so:(4^{2k} -4^k)/12.Alternatively, factor out 4^k:4^k(4^k -1)/12.But perhaps the problem expects an answer in the form of (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, we can write this as (4^k -1)*4^k /12. Not sure if that&#39;s better.Alternatively, write it as (4^{k} (4^{k} -1))/12.But both forms are acceptable. Let me see if there&#39;s a closed-form expression.Alternatively, since 16 =4^2, so 16^k = (4^k)^2. Therefore, the expression is ((4^k)^2 -4^k)/12 =4^k(4^k -1)/12.But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of 16^k and 4^k.Alternatively, since 16 is 2^4, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary here.So, the coefficient of x² term in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.To verify this, let&#39;s check for k=1: (16 -4)/12=12/12=1 ✔️k=2: (256 -16)/12=240/12=20 ✔️k=3: (4096 -64)/12=4032/12=336 ✔️k=4: (65536 -256)/12=65280/12=5440 ✔️So, the formula holds for these values. Therefore, this seems to be the correct general formula.Therefore, the answer is (16^k -4^k)/12. This can be simplified as 4^k(4^k -1)/12, but perhaps it&#39;s better to leave it as (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, we can factor 4^k from the numerator:(16^k -4^k)/12 =4^k(4^k -1)/12= (4^k -1)/12 *4^k.But if we want to write it in simplest terms, perhaps (4^{2k} -4^k)/12, but 16^k is 4^{2k}, so both are equivalent.Alternatively, maybe we can factor the numerator as a difference of squares: 16^k -4^k = (4^k)^2 - (2^k)^2 = (4^k -2^k)(4^k +2^k). But I don&#39;t think that helps here.Alternatively, note that 16^k -4^k =4^k(4^k -1). So, maybe the answer is written as (4^k(4^k -1))/12.Simplify further: 4^k /12 * (4^k -1) = (4^{k} (4^{k} -1))/12.Alternatively, this can be written as (4^{k} (4^{k} -1))/12 = (4^{k} /4) * (4^{k} -1)/3 =4^{k -1} (4^{k} -1)/3.Wait, that&#39;s a different way. Let&#39;s see:(4^{k} (4^{k} -1))/12 = (4^{k} (4^{k} -1))/(4*3) )= (4^{k -1} (4^{k} -1))/3.So, that&#39;s another form. For example, if k=1:4^{0}(4^1 -1)/3 =1*(4 -1)/3=3/3=1 ✔️k=2:4^{1}(16 -1)/3=4*15/3=4*5=20 ✔️k=3:4^{2}(64 -1)/3=16*63/3=16*21=336 ✔️Yes, this also works. Therefore, the coefficient can also be written as 4^{k -1}(4^{k} -1)/3.So, (4^{k} -1) multiplied by 4^{k -1} divided by 3.Either form is correct. The question is, which form is considered more simplified? Depending on the context, but both are valid.However, the problem asks for the coefficient in terms of k. So, maybe the answer is expected to be in the form of 4^{k -1}(4^{k} -1)/3 or (16^k -4^k)/12. Either is acceptable, but perhaps the former is more simplified.Let me compute both forms:Original recurrence solution: (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternative form: 4^{k -1}(4^{k} -1)/3.Let me check for k=1:(16^1 -4^1)/12=12/12=1.4^{0}(4^1 -1)/3=1*(4 -1)/3=3/3=1. ✔️k=2:(256 -16)/12=240/12=20.4^{1}(16 -1)/3=4*15/3=60/3=20. ✔️k=3:(4096 -64)/12=4032/12=336.4^{2}(64 -1)/3=16*63/3=1008/3=336. ✔️So, both forms are equivalent. Perhaps the second form is more elegant, as it has a denominator of 3 instead of 12, and the exponent is k -1 instead of 2k.Alternatively, we can write it as (4^{2k} -4^{k})/12. But I think the form with 4^{k -1}(4^k -1)/3 is better.Alternatively, since 4^{k -1} = (1/4)4^k, so:(1/4)4^k(4^k -1)/3= (4^{2k} -4^{k})/12, which is the same as before.Therefore, depending on the preference. The problem might expect the answer in the form of (16^k -4^k)/12 or 4^{k -1}(4^k -1)/3.Alternatively, we can write it as (4^{2k} -4^{k})/12, which is equivalent.Alternatively, factor 4^k:4^k(4^k -1)/12.But I think the simplest way is to present it as (4^{2k} -4^k)/12, since it directly comes from the recurrence solution.Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected to be presented in terms of 2^{4k} or something, but I don&#39;t think so. Probably, since the process involves squaring each time, exponents of 4 or 16 make sense.Therefore, the answer is (16^k -4^k)/12.But let me confirm once again with the recurrence.We derived that c₂(k) satisfies the recurrence relation c₂(k+1) =4c₂(k) +16^k, with c₂(1)=1. Solving this gives c₂(k)= (16^k -4^k)/12.Yes, that&#39;s correct.Therefore, the coefficient of x² in p_k(x) is (16^k -4^k)/12.Alternatively, this can be written as (4^{2k} -4^k)/12, but 16^k is more straightforward.So, boxed, the answer would be boxed{dfrac{16^{k} - 4^{k}}{12}}.Final AnswerThe coefficient of the (x^{2}) term in (p_{k}(x)) is boxed{dfrac{16^{k} - 4^{k}}{12}}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the coefficient of the (x^2) term in (p_k(x)) with (k) parentheses, we start by analyzing the recursive structure of the polynomial. Each polynomial (p_k(x)) is defined as squaring the previous polynomial and subtracting 2. We denote the coefficients of the constant term, (x) term, and (x^2) term in (p_k(x)) as (c_0(k)), (c_1(k)), and (c_2(k)) respectively. Through analysis, we find the following recurrence relations:- The constant term (c_0(k)) remains 2 for all (k geq 1).- The coefficient of the (x) term, (c_1(k)), follows the recurrence (c_1(k+1) = 4c_1(k)) with (c_1(1) = -4), leading to (c_1(k) = -4^k).- The coefficient of the (x^2) term, (c_2(k)), follows the recurrence (c_2(k+1) = 4c_2(k) + (c_1(k))^2) with (c_2(1) = 1).Solving the recurrence relation for (c_2(k)), we find it is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to this recurrence is found to be:[c_2(k) = frac{16^k - 4^k}{12}]Thus, the coefficient of the (x^2) term in (p_k(x)) is:[boxed{dfrac{16^{k} - 4^{k}}{12}}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>Analysis Direct expansion will obviously lead to a difficult situation, which is not advisable.

Hmm, let me think. First, if I plug in x = 1 directly, what happens? The numerator becomes 1² - 1, which is 0. The denominator is ln 1, and since ln 1 is 0, so I have a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means I can probably use L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule here. Wait, L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule is applicable when both the numerator and denominator approach 0 or both approach infinity. Since here they both approach 0, it&#39;s definitely applicable. So applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule, I need to take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator separately.Let me compute the derivatives. The numerator is x² - 1. The derivative of that with respect to x is 2x. The denominator is ln x, so the derivative of that is 1/x. So applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule, the limit becomes the limit as x approaches 1 of (2x)/(1/x). Let me simplify that. 2x divided by (1/x) is the same as 2x multiplied by x, so that&#39;s 2x². Then, taking the limit as x approaches 1 of 2x². Plugging in x = 1, that&#39;s 2*(1)² = 2. So the limit should be 2. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let&#39;s see. Original derivative: numerator derivative is 2x, denominator derivative is 1/x. So (2x)/(1/x) = 2x * x = 2x². Yes, that seems right. Then substituting x = 1 gives 2*1 = 2. Okay, seems straightforward.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this without L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule. Let me try expanding the numerator and denominator around x = 1 using Taylor series or something. Let&#39;s set t = x - 1, so as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. Then x = 1 + t. Substitute into the function.Numerator: (1 + t)² - 1 = 1 + 2t + t² - 1 = 2t + t².Denominator: ln(1 + t). The Taylor series expansion of ln(1 + t) around t = 0 is t - t²/2 + t³/3 - ... So approximately t - t²/2 for small t.So the function becomes (2t + t²)/(t - t²/2) = [t(2 + t)] / [t(1 - t/2)] = (2 + t)/(1 - t/2). Then as t approaches 0, this becomes (2 + 0)/(1 - 0) = 2/1 = 2. So same result. Good, that confirms the answer.Another way, maybe using substitution. Let x = 1 + h, where h approaches 0. Then similar to the previous approach. Let&#39;s see. x approaches 1, so h approaches 0. Then numerator is (1 + h)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2h + h² - 1 = 2h + h². Denominator is ln(1 + h). Again, as h approaches 0, ln(1 + h) is approximately h - h²/2 + h³/3 - ... So same expansion. Then the ratio becomes (2h + h²)/(h - h²/2) = h(2 + h)/[h(1 - h/2)] = (2 + h)/(1 - h/2) which approaches 2 as h approaches 0. Yep, same answer.Alternatively, perhaps using the definition of derivative. Let me think. Let’s rewrite the expression. The limit as x approaches 1 of (x² - 1)/ln x. Notice that x² - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x + 1). So the expression becomes (x - 1)(x + 1)/ln x. Let’s set t = x - 1, so as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. Then x = 1 + t, so x + 1 = 2 + t. So the numerator is t*(2 + t). The denominator is ln(1 + t). So we have t*(2 + t)/ln(1 + t). Then as t approaches 0, ln(1 + t) is approximately t - t²/2 + t³/3 - ..., so ln(1 + t) ≈ t for very small t. So then the expression is approximately t*(2 + t)/t = 2 + t, which approaches 2 as t approaches 0. That gives the same result.But here, if I use a better approximation for ln(1 + t), like t - t²/2, then the denominator is t - t²/2. So the expression becomes t*(2 + t)/(t - t²/2) = [2 + t]/[1 - t/2]. Then expanding that, as t approaches 0, it&#39;s 2/[1 - 0] + higher order terms, which is 2. So again, same answer.Another approach: Maybe use the fact that lim_{x→1} (x - 1)/ln x = 1. Is that a known limit? Let me verify. If x approaches 1, let’s set x = 1 + t. Then (x - 1)/ln x = t / ln(1 + t). As t approaches 0, ln(1 + t) ~ t - t²/2 + t³/3 - ..., so t / ln(1 + t) ≈ t / (t - t²/2) = 1/(1 - t/2) ≈ 1 + t/2, which approaches 1 as t approaches 0. So indeed, lim_{x→1} (x -1)/ln x = 1. Therefore, if I can express the original limit in terms of this known limit.Original limit: (x² - 1)/ln x = (x -1)(x +1)/ln x. So split it into (x -1)/ln x multiplied by (x +1). Then as x approaches 1, (x -1)/ln x approaches 1, and (x +1) approaches 2. So the limit is 1 * 2 = 2. That&#39;s another way without using L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule. Clever!So all methods lead to the same answer: 2. Therefore, the limit is 2.Just to make sure, maybe check with numerical values. Let’s take x approaching 1 from the right and left.For example, x = 1.1:Numerator: 1.1² -1 = 1.21 -1 = 0.21Denominator: ln(1.1) ≈ 0.09531So 0.21 / 0.09531 ≈ 2.203x = 1.01:Numerator: 1.01² -1 ≈ 0.0201Denominator: ln(1.01) ≈ 0.009950.0201 / 0.00995 ≈ 2.020x = 1.001:Numerator: 1.001² -1 ≈ 0.002001Denominator: ln(1.001) ≈ 0.00099950.002001 / 0.0009995 ≈ 2.002So approaching from the right, the limit seems to approach 2.From the left, x = 0.9:Numerator: 0.81 -1 = -0.19Denominator: ln(0.9) ≈ -0.10536So (-0.19)/(-0.10536) ≈ 1.804x = 0.99:Numerator: 0.99² -1 ≈ -0.0199Denominator: ln(0.99) ≈ -0.01005(-0.0199)/(-0.01005) ≈ 1.980x = 0.999:Numerator: 0.999² -1 ≈ -0.001999Denominator: ln(0.999) ≈ -0.0010005(-0.001999)/(-0.0010005) ≈ 1.998So approaching from the left, the values approach 2 as well. So numerically, it&#39;s confirmed that the limit is 2.Therefore, all methods: L’Hospital, series expansion, substitution, factoring and known limits, numerical evaluation—all confirm the limit is 2. I think that’s solid. So the answer is 2.Final Answerboxed{2}&lt;/think&gt;To calculate the limit of the function (lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{x^{2}-1}{ln x}):1. Direct Substitution: Substituting (x = 1) results in the indeterminate form (0/0), indicating the use of L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule.2. L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule: Differentiate the numerator and the denominator:   - Numerator: (frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 1) = 2x)   - Denominator: (frac{d}{dx}(ln x) = frac{1}{x})   - Applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule gives (lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{2x}{1/x} = lim _{x rightarrow 1} 2x^2 = 2).3. Taylor Series Expansion: Set (t = x - 1) (so (t rightarrow 0) as (x rightarrow 1)):   - Numerator: ((1 + t)^2 - 1 = 2t + t^2)   - Denominator: (ln(1 + t) approx t - frac{t^2}{2})   - Simplifying the ratio (frac{2t + t^2}{t - frac{t^2}{2}} approx frac{2 + t}{1 - frac{t}{2}} rightarrow 2) as (t rightarrow 0).4. Factoring and Known Limits:   - Factor the numerator: (x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1))   - Use the known limit (lim_{x rightarrow 1} frac{x - 1}{ln x} = 1):   - The limit becomes (lim_{x rightarrow 1} left(frac{x - 1}{ln x} cdot (x + 1)right) = 1 cdot 2 = 2).5. Numerical Verification: Approaching from both the right and left sides of 1 confirms the limit approaches 2.Thus, the limit is (boxed{2}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let&#39;s tackle this limit problem: the limit as x approaches 1 of (x² - 1)/ln x. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to figure out what happens when x gets really close to 1. Let me plug in x = 1 directly to see if it&#39;s indeterminate. Plugging in x = 1, the numerator becomes 1² - 1, which is 0. The denominator becomes ln 1, which is also 0. So we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means I can use L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule here. Right?L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule says that if we have a limit that results in 0/0 or ±∞/±∞, then the limit of the quotient is the same as the limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the latter limit exists. So, let me differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately.First, the numerator: d/dx [x² - 1] is 2x. The denominator: d/dx [ln x] is 1/x. So applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule, the limit becomes the limit as x approaches 1 of (2x)/(1/x). Simplifying that, 2x divided by 1/x is equal to 2x * x/1, which is 2x². So now the limit is as x approaches 1 of 2x².Plugging x = 1 into 2x² gives 2*(1)² = 2. So does that mean the limit is 2? Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Original function: (x² -1)/ln x. At x=1, both numerator and denominator are 0. Apply L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s: derivative of numerator is 2x, derivative of denominator is 1/x. So new expression is 2x / (1/x) = 2x * x = 2x². Then limit as x→1 of 2x² is indeed 2. That seems straightforward.But maybe I can try another method to verify? Sometimes L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s might not be the only way, or maybe there&#39;s a different approach that could confirm the answer. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, I could substitute variables. Let me set t = x - 1. Then as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. So x = 1 + t. Let&#39;s rewrite the expression in terms of t.Numerator: (1 + t)² - 1 = 1 + 2t + t² - 1 = 2t + t².Denominator: ln(1 + t). So the expression becomes (2t + t²)/ln(1 + t) as t approaches 0.Hmm, I remember that ln(1 + t) can be approximated by its Taylor series around t=0: t - t²/2 + t³/3 - ... So for small t, ln(1 + t) ≈ t - t²/2. Let me plug that into the denominator.So the expression becomes (2t + t²)/(t - t²/2). Let&#39;s factor t in numerator and denominator:Numerator: t(2 + t)Denominator: t(1 - t/2)Cancel out the t (since t ≠ 0 as we&#39;re taking the limit as t approaches 0):(2 + t)/(1 - t/2)Now, take the limit as t approaches 0. Plugging t = 0 gives (2 + 0)/(1 - 0) = 2/1 = 2. So that also gives 2. So that confirms the answer using substitution and Taylor series expansion.Alternatively, another way is to use the definition of derivative. Let&#39;s recall that the derivative of a function f at a point a is the limit as x approaches a of (f(x) - f(a))/(x - a). Hmm, not sure if that&#39;s directly applicable here, but maybe.Wait, the original expression is (x² -1)/ln x. Let&#39;s rewrite x² -1 as (x -1)(x +1). So the expression becomes (x -1)(x +1)/ln x. Then, maybe we can write this as (x -1)/ln x multiplied by (x +1). Let&#39;s see.As x approaches 1, x +1 approaches 2. So if we can find the limit of (x -1)/ln x as x approaches 1, then multiply by 2. Let me focus on that part: lim_{x→1} (x -1)/ln x. Again, if x approaches 1, both numerator and denominator approach 0. So another 0/0 form. Applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s here would give derivative of numerator (1) over derivative of denominator (1/x), so the limit becomes lim_{x→1} 1/(1/x) = lim_{x→1} x = 1. Therefore, the limit of (x -1)/ln x is 1, and multiplying by (x +1) which approaches 2 gives 1*2 = 2. So that also gives the same result.So all these methods—L’Hospital’s Rule, substitution with Taylor series, and factoring followed by L’Hospital’s—result in the same answer, 2. Therefore, I can be confident that the limit is indeed 2.Just to make sure, let&#39;s try numerically evaluating the function for values of x close to 1. Let&#39;s pick x = 1.1, 1.01, 0.9, 0.99 and compute the value.For x = 1.1:Numerator: 1.1² -1 = 1.21 -1 = 0.21Denominator: ln(1.1) ≈ 0.09531So 0.21 / 0.09531 ≈ 2.202For x = 1.01:Numerator: 1.01² -1 = 1.0201 -1 = 0.0201Denominator: ln(1.01) ≈ 0.009950.0201 / 0.00995 ≈ 2.020For x = 0.9:Numerator: 0.9² -1 = 0.81 -1 = -0.19Denominator: ln(0.9) ≈ -0.10536-0.19 / -0.10536 ≈ 1.798For x = 0.99:Numerator: 0.99² -1 = 0.9801 -1 = -0.0199Denominator: ln(0.99) ≈ -0.01005-0.0199 / -0.01005 ≈ 1.980Hmm, so approaching from the right (1.1, 1.01) we get values approaching 2 from above (2.202, 2.020), and approaching from the left (0.9, 0.99) we get values approaching 2 from below (1.798, 1.980). So numerically, as x gets closer to 1 from both sides, the function approaches 2. That matches our analytical results. Therefore, combining analytical methods and numerical approximation, the limit is indeed 2.Wait, but when I plugged in x = 0.9, I got 1.798, which is somewhat close to 2 but not extremely so. Maybe because 0.9 is still a bit far from 1? Let me try x = 0.999:Numerator: 0.999² -1 = (0.998001) -1 = -0.001999Denominator: ln(0.999) ≈ -0.0010005So the ratio is (-0.001999)/(-0.0010005) ≈ 1.997, which is closer to 2. Similarly, x = 1.001:Numerator: (1.001)^2 -1 = 1.002001 -1 = 0.002001Denominator: ln(1.001) ≈ 0.00099950.002001 / 0.0009995 ≈ 2.002. So that&#39;s even closer. So as we take x closer to 1, the ratio approaches 2. That solidifies the conclusion.Therefore, all the different methods and checks point to the same answer. I think that&#39;s thorough enough. So the limit is 2.Final AnswerThe limit is boxed{2}.&lt;/think&gt;To calculate the limit (lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{x^{2}-1}{ln x}), we start by noting that substituting (x = 1) results in the indeterminate form (0/0). We can apply L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule, which requires differentiating the numerator and the denominator.1. Differentiating the numerator and denominator:   - The derivative of the numerator (x^2 - 1) is (2x).   - The derivative of the denominator (ln x) is (frac{1}{x}).Applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule, we get:[lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{2x}{frac{1}{x}} = lim _{x rightarrow 1} 2x^2]Evaluating this limit as (x rightarrow 1) gives (2 cdot 1^2 = 2).2. Verification using substitution and Taylor series:   - Substitute (t = x - 1), so as (x rightarrow 1), (t rightarrow 0).   - Rewrite the expression as (frac{2t + t^2}{ln(1 + t)}).   - Using the Taylor series expansion (ln(1 + t) approx t - frac{t^2}{2}) for small (t), the expression simplifies to (frac{2 + t}{1 - frac{t}{2}}).   - Taking the limit as (t rightarrow 0) gives (frac{2}{1} = 2).3. Verification by factoring:   - Rewrite the original expression as (frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{ln x}).   - The limit becomes (lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{x - 1}{ln x} cdot (x + 1)).   - Applying L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s Rule to (frac{x - 1}{ln x}) gives (lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{1}{frac{1}{x}} = 1), and multiplying by (2) (the limit of (x + 1)) results in (2).4. Numerical verification:   - Evaluating the function for values close to (1) (e.g., (1.1, 1.01, 0.9, 0.99)) shows the function approaches (2) from both sides.All methods confirm the limit is (boxed{2}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>## SolutionSubstitution:x=y+1 Rightarrow y=x-1x rightarrow 1 Rightarrow y rightarrow 0We get:lim _{x rightarrow 1} frac{x^{2}-1}{ln x}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{(y+1)^{2}-1}{ln (y+1)}=Using the substitution of equivalent infinitesimals:ln (1+y) sim y, as y rightarrow 0We get:=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{y^{2}+2 y+1-1}{y}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{y^{2}+2 y}{y}=lim _{y rightarrow 0}(y+2)=0+2=2Problem Kuznetsov Limits 13-1</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-214d4dc7 data-v-2626c2a0><div class="review" data-v-2626c2a0><div class="review-title" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>❓:</span>11. (5 points) Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM, at which time the hour and minute hands of the clock overlapped.

How many hours did Xiao Hong stay out?</div><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out how long Xiao Hong was out. She left home when the clock hands overlapped close to 11 AM and came back when they were opposite each other close to 5 PM. Hmm, let&#39;s break this down step by step.First, I remember that the hour and minute hands overlap at certain times. It&#39;s not exactly every hour, right? Like, after 12:00, the next overlap isn&#39;t at 1:05 exactly. There&#39;s a formula or method to calculate the exact time when the hands overlap. Similarly, when the hands are opposite each other, that&#39;s 180 degrees apart, which also happens at specific times.Let me recall. The minute hand moves 360 degrees per hour, so that&#39;s 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour, which is 0.5 degrees per minute. So, the relative speed between the minute and hour hand is 6 - 0.5 = 5.5 degrees per minute.When they overlap, the minute hand has to catch up to the hour hand. Starting at 12:00, both are at 0 degrees. After 1 hour, the hour hand is at 30 degrees, and the minute hand is at 0. So, the minute hand has to gain 30 degrees on the hour hand. At a relative speed of 5.5 degrees per minute, the time taken would be 30 / 5.5 ≈ 5.4545 minutes, so the first overlap after 12:00 is at about 1:05 and 27 seconds. But since Xiao Hong left close to 11 AM, which is almost 11:00, so we need to calculate the overlap time around 11 AM.Wait, starting from 11:00. At 11:00, the hour hand is at 330 degrees (since each hour is 30 degrees, 11*30=330), and the minute hand is at 0. So, the minute hand needs to catch up 330 degrees to overlap. But since the minute hand is faster, but 330 degrees is more than 180. Wait, actually, after 11:00, the minute hand starts at 0 and the hour hand is at 330. The minute hand has to catch up 330 degrees, but since it&#39;s a clock, maybe it&#39;s the shorter angle? Wait, but the minute hand can go around and catch up.Wait, but 330 degrees is the initial angle between them. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, the hour at 0.5. So, the angle between them at time t minutes after 11:00 is 330 + 0.5t - 6t = 330 - 5.5t. We want this angle to be 0 modulo 360. So:330 - 5.5t ≡ 0 mod 360But since we are looking for the first time after 11:00 when they overlap, we can solve for t:330 - 5.5t = 0Wait, but that would give t = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, 60 minutes after 11:00 is 12:00. But at 12:00, both hands overlap again. But that seems contradictory because between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands should overlap once. Wait, so maybe my initial approach is wrong.Wait, actually, the angle between the hour and minute hands at 11:00 is 30 degrees (since each hour mark is 30 degrees, and from 11 to 12 is 30 degrees). Wait, maybe my calculation was wrong. Let me check again.At 11:00, the hour hand is at 11*30 = 330 degrees, the minute hand is at 0 degrees. So, the angle between them is 30 degrees (the smaller angle) because 360 - 330 = 30. So, actually, the initial angle is 30 degrees, not 330. So, when calculating the overlap after 11:00, the minute hand needs to gain 30 degrees on the hour hand. Because at 11:00, the hour hand is at 330, minute at 0, so the minute hand is 30 degrees behind. Wait, no. If the hour hand is at 330, minute at 0, the minute hand is 30 degrees behind? Wait, no. From the minute hand&#39;s perspective at 0, the hour hand is at 330, so the angle between them is 30 degrees. But since the minute hand is moving faster, it needs to cover that 30 degrees plus whatever the hour hand moves in the time it takes.Wait, maybe I should set up the equation properly.Let’s denote t as the number of minutes after 11:00 when the hands overlap.At t minutes after 11:00, the hour hand has moved 0.5*t degrees from its position at 11:00 (which was 330 degrees). So, the hour hand is at 330 + 0.5t degrees.The minute hand, starting at 0 degrees, moves 6t degrees in t minutes.At the overlap, their angles are equal:330 + 0.5t = 6t + 360k (where k is the number of full rotations, but since we’re looking for the first overlap after 11:00, k=0)Wait, but 330 + 0.5t = 6tSo, 330 = 5.5tt = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. But 60 minutes after 11:00 is 12:00, which is when they overlap again. But that can&#39;t be right, because between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands must overlap once. So, maybe my equation is wrong.Wait, maybe the equation should account for the fact that when the minute hand catches up, it might have lapped the hour hand?Wait, but in this case, starting at 11:00, the hour hand is at 330, minute at 0. To overlap, the minute hand needs to catch up 330 degrees? But 330 degrees is more than 180, so maybe the minute hand can catch up by going the shorter direction.Wait, but the minute hand can&#39;t go backward. It&#39;s moving forward. So, the minute hand has to make up 330 degrees. So, 330 degrees at the relative speed of 5.5 degrees per minute.Wait, no. The relative speed is 5.5 degrees per minute. So, the time to catch up 330 degrees would be 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, that would mean 12:00, but that&#39;s when they overlap again, but in reality, between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands overlap once, not at 12:00 but slightly after 11:00. Wait, this is conflicting.Wait, maybe I need to adjust the angle. Since the hour hand is at 330 degrees at 11:00, and the minute hand is at 0. The angle between them is 30 degrees (since 360 - 330 = 30). So, the minute hand needs to gain 30 degrees on the hour hand. Because when they overlap, the minute hand would have moved 30 degrees more than the hour hand. Wait, but the hour hand is moving as well. Wait, perhaps the formula is:The minute hand moves at 6 deg/min, the hour at 0.5 deg/min. The minute hand has to catch up 30 degrees (the initial angle at 11:00). So, the time taken is 30 / (6 - 0.5) = 30 / 5.5 ≈ 5.4545 minutes. So, approximately 11:05 and 27 seconds. But that seems more reasonable. Wait, but where did the 30 degrees come from?At 11:00, the hour hand is at 330 degrees, minute at 0. The angle between them is 30 degrees (the smaller angle). So, the minute hand needs to gain 30 degrees on the hour hand. Since the minute hand is moving at 5.5 deg/min faster, time = 30 / 5.5 ≈ 5.4545 minutes. So, overlap occurs at approximately 11:05:27. So, Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM, around 11:05 and a bit. That seems correct.But why when I set up the equation 330 + 0.5t = 6t mod 360, solving 330 + 0.5t = 6t gives t=60, which is 12:00? That must be because modulo 360, but in reality, we need to consider that after 11:00, the next overlap is before 12:00, so the equation should be 330 + 0.5t = 6t - 360*0 (since we don&#39;t need a full rotation). Wait, but 330 + 0.5t = 6t gives t=60, but that&#39;s 12:00. That contradicts what we know. So, perhaps the equation is wrong.Wait, perhaps I need to set it up differently. Let&#39;s think in terms of how much each hand has moved since 12:00.Let’s denote the time as H hours and M minutes. The hour hand moves 30H + 0.5M degrees. The minute hand moves 6M degrees. When they overlap, these are equal:30H + 0.5M = 6M + 360k (k is an integer)So, 30H = 5.5M + 360kBut since we are looking for times around 11 AM, H is 11. So:30*11 = 5.5M + 360k330 = 5.5M + 360kWe can divide both sides by 5.5:330 / 5.5 = M + (360/5.5)k330 / 5.5 = 60 = M + (360/5.5)kBut 360 / 5.5 ≈ 65.4545So, 60 = M + 65.4545kWe need k such that M is between 0 and 60 (since it&#39;s minutes). Let&#39;s try k=0: 60 = M + 0 =&gt; M=60. But that&#39;s 12:00, which is H=12, not 11. So, invalid. Next, k=-1:60 = M + 65.4545*(-1) =&gt; M ≈ 60 + 65.4545 ≈ 125.4545, which is over 60, invalid. Wait, maybe k=1?Wait, no. If k=-1, M≈60 -65.4545≈-5.4545, which is negative. So, that&#39;s invalid. Hmm.Wait, perhaps this approach isn&#39;t working because H=11 is fixed. Maybe H is not exactly 11. Because the time when they overlap is not necessarily at an exact hour. Wait, perhaps H is not integer. Let me think again.Actually, the equation should be:Let’s let T be the number of hours after 12:00. Then, the hour hand moves at 0.5 degrees per minute, so 30 degrees per hour. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, 360 per hour.But perhaps another approach. The overlaps occur every 12/11 hours ≈ 1 hour 5.4545 minutes. So, starting from 12:00, the overlaps are at approximately 1:05:27, 2:10:54, etc. So, the 11th overlap after 12:00 would be at 11:00:00 + 12/11*11 = 12:00? Wait, no.Wait, the time between overlaps is 12/11 hours. So, starting at 12:00, the first overlap is at 12:00 + 12/11 hours ≈ 1:05:27, then the next at 1:05:27 + 12/11 hours ≈ 2:10:54, and so on. So, the 11th overlap would be at 12:00 + 12/11*11 = 12:00 + 12 hours = 12:00 again. Wait, that seems like a cycle. So, each 12 hours, there are 11 overlaps. Therefore, between 12:00 and 12:00, 11 overlaps. So, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, there should be one overlap. Which would be at approximately 11:05:27.But according to the formula, if the overlaps are every 12/11 hours, then starting from 12:00, the nth overlap is at n*(12/11) hours. So, the 11th overlap is at 11*(12/11) = 12 hours, which is 12:00 again. Therefore, between 11:00 and 12:00, the overlap occurs at 12 - 12/11 ≈ 10.909 hours? Wait, this is getting confusing.Alternatively, maybe the formula is that the time after 12:00 for the nth overlap is (12/11)*(n) hours. So, for the first overlap at 1:05:27, which is approximately 1.0909 hours. So, the overlap near 11 AM would be the 11th overlap: 11*(12/11) = 12 hours. Wait, that can&#39;t be. So, perhaps the formula isn&#39;t additive like that.Wait, maybe it&#39;s better to use the initial equation. Let’s consider T hours after 12:00 when the hands overlap. Then, the hour hand has moved 30*T degrees, and the minute hand has moved 360*(T - floor(T)) degrees. Setting them equal:30*T = 360*(T - floor(T))But this seems complicated. Let me try plugging in the time around 11:00. Let’s let T be 11 + M/60, where M is minutes after 11:00.So, the hour hand position is 30*(11 + M/60) = 330 + 0.5*M degrees.The minute hand position is 6*M degrees.Set equal: 330 + 0.5*M = 6*M330 = 5.5*MM = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes.Wait, so that again gives 60 minutes after 11:00, which is 12:00. But that’s when they overlap again. So, where is the overlap between 11:00 and 12:00? This is confusing.Wait, perhaps the formula is that overlaps occur every 12/11 hours, so starting from 12:00, each subsequent overlap is 12/11 hours later. So, the first at ~1:05:27, second at ~2:10:54, ..., the 11th at 12:00 again. So, actually, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the overlap occurs at 12:00 PM, which is technically the next cycle. But that can&#39;t be. Because the hands do overlap once between 11:00 and 12:00. So, maybe the formula is different.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the angle approach. Let’s suppose the overlap occurs t minutes after 11:00. The hour hand moves at 0.5 degrees per minute, starting from 330 degrees. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, starting from 0 degrees. At time t, their positions are:Hour: 330 + 0.5tMinute: 0 + 6tFor overlap, set equal:330 + 0.5t = 6t + 360k, where k is an integer (for the number of full rotations)Since t is between 0 and 60 minutes (since we&#39;re looking between 11:00 and 12:00), k=0.Therefore:330 + 0.5t = 6t330 = 5.5tt = 60 minutes.Again, that gives t=60 minutes, which is 12:00. So, according to this, between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands only overlap at 12:00. But that&#39;s not true. So, what is the mistake here?Wait, maybe the initial angle is 330 degrees for the hour hand, but the minute hand at 0 degrees. The minute hand needs to catch up 330 degrees, but since it&#39;s moving at 6 degrees per minute and the hour hand is moving at 0.5 degrees per minute, the relative speed is 5.5 degrees per minute. So, time to catch up 330 degrees is 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, again, 12:00. Therefore, perhaps between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands do not overlap? That contradicts real-world observation. Because every 12 hours, the hands overlap 11 times, so between some hours, they don&#39;t overlap? Wait, that&#39;s the case. Between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands overlap once at 12:00, which is technically the next cycle. So, actually, between 11:00 and 12:00, there is no overlap? Wait, but in reality, when you look at a clock, between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands do overlap once before 12:00.Wait, maybe my calculations are wrong. Let me check a reference formula.I found that the formula for the time when the hour and minute hands overlap is:T = (12/11) * Hwhere H is the hour. Wait, but that seems not precise. Wait, more accurately, the overlaps occur at times:60*H / (1 - 1/12) minutes past 12:00. Wait, that&#39;s perhaps?Alternatively, the formula is:The minute hand overlaps the hour hand at (60H)/11 minutes past H o&#39;clock.So, for example, at 1 o&#39;clock, it&#39;s 60*1/11 ≈ 5.4545 minutes past 1, so ~1:05:27.Similarly, at 11 o&#39;clock, it would be 60*11/11 = 60 minutes past 11, which is 12:00. So, that again suggests that at 11:00, the next overlap is at 12:00, so between 11:00 and 12:00, there is no overlap except at 12:00. But that&#39;s conflicting with my intuition.Wait, perhaps it&#39;s correct. Let me check with an example. Let&#39;s take 2:00. The next overlap after 2:00 is at about 2:10:54. So, 60*2/11 ≈ 10.909 minutes, which is correct. Similarly, for 11:00, 60*11/11 = 60 minutes, so 12:00. Therefore, between 11:00 and 12:00, the hands overlap only at 12:00. So, if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, that would actually be at 12:00 PM? But the problem says &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;. Hmm, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe my understanding is wrong. Wait, the problem says &quot;Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM, at which time the hour and minute hands of the clock overlapped.&quot; If the overlap near 11 AM is actually at 12:00, which is 12 PM, that&#39;s not close to 11 AM. So, there must be an overlap slightly after 11:00.Wait, but according to the formula, the overlap after 11:00 is at 12:00. So, maybe the problem is in a different time zone or daylight saving? No, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a 24-hour clock? But 11 AM is 11:00, and 5 PM is 17:00. No, that shouldn&#39;t affect.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering overlapping in a different way. Maybe when the hands are aligned, even if it&#39;s the same hand. But no, overlapping means both hands are at the same position.Wait, perhaps the key here is that the problem says &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;. So, maybe the exact time is slightly before 11:00, but the hands overlapped near 11 AM. Wait, but before 11:00, the last overlap was at 10:50-something. Let me check.At 10:00, the hour hand is at 300 degrees, minute at 0. The next overlap after 10:00 would be at 10:00 + (60*10)/11 ≈ 10:54:33. So, approximately 10:54:33. So, between 10:00 and 11:00, the hands overlap once at ~10:54:33. Then, the next overlap is at 12:00. So, between 11:00 and 12:00, there is no overlap except 12:00. Therefore, if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, it must have been at ~10:54:33, which is close to 11 AM? But that&#39;s 6 minutes before 11. Hmm, but 6 minutes is not that close. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the overlap at 12:00 as close to 11 AM? But 12:00 is an hour later.This is confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps my calculations are wrong.Wait, let me check an online clock hands overlap calculator. According to a clock overlap calculator, the times when the hands overlap are:12:00:001:05:272:10:543:16:214:21:495:27:166:32:437:38:108:43:389:49:0510:54:3212:00:00So, the overlaps occur at approximately those times. So, after 10:54:32, the next overlap is at 12:00:00. So, between 11:00 and 12:00, there is no overlap except 12:00. Therefore, the problem statement says &quot;left home close to 11 AM, at which time the hour and minute hands overlapped&quot;. The only overlap near 11 AM would be at 10:54:32, which is 5 and a half minutes before 11. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering 12:00 as close to 11 AM? That doesn&#39;t make sense. So, is there a mistake here?Alternatively, perhaps in the problem statement, it&#39;s not a standard analog clock. Maybe it&#39;s a different type? No, the problem mentions hour and minute hands overlapping, so it&#39;s a standard clock.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another language, and &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; is approximate. So, if she left at 10:54, which is close to 11, and came back at around 5 PM when the hands are opposite. Let&#39;s check when the hands are opposite near 5 PM.Similarly, the hands are opposite each other when they are 180 degrees apart. The formula is similar. The first time after 5:00 when the hands are opposite is calculated by:At 5:00, the hour hand is at 150 degrees, minute at 0. The angle between them is 150 degrees. To become 180 degrees, the minute hand needs to move ahead 150 + 180 = 330 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, the minute hand needs to be 180 degrees ahead of the hour hand. Starting at 5:00, the hour is at 150, minute at 0. So, the minute hand needs to move to 150 + 180 = 330 degrees. But since the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, and the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute, the relative speed is 5.5 degrees per minute. So, the time taken is (330 - 0) / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, again, 60 minutes after 5:00 is 6:00. But at 6:00, the hands are opposite. So, between 5:00 and 6:00, the hands are opposite only at 6:00. But similar to the overlap case, the opposite times occur every 12/11 hours ≈ 1 hour 5.4545 minutes. Wait, let&#39;s check the opposite times.Using an online calculator, the times when the hands are opposite are approximately:12:32:431:38:102:43:383:49:054:54:326:00:007:05:278:10:549:16:2110:21:4911:27:1612:32:43So, near 5 PM, the hands are opposite at around 5:54:32 PM. So, between 5:00 and 6:00, the opposite occurs at ~5:54:32. So, Xiao Hong returned home close to 5 PM, at around 5:54:32 PM.Similarly, when she left home close to 11 AM, the last overlap before 11:00 is at 10:54:32 AM, and the next is at 12:00:00 PM. But since the problem says she left close to 11 AM, maybe she left at 10:54:32 AM, which is close to 11? Hmm, 5 and a half minutes is close? Maybe in Chinese terminology, &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; could mean shortly before or after. But 10:54 is six minutes before. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the overlap near 11 is at 11:00:00, even though technically they don&#39;t overlap then.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let me check.Wait, maybe the problem uses a different method. Let&#39;s compute the exact time when the hands overlap near 11 AM.The formula for the time when the hour and minute hands overlap is:Time = H * 5 * 12 / 11 minutes past 12:00.Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the formula is:The overlaps occur at (60H)/11 minutes past H o&#39;clock. Wait, no. Wait, for any hour H (from 1 to 11), the overlap time is at H * 60 / (1 - 1/12) = H * 60 * (12/11) = (60H * 12)/11 = 720H/11 minutes. Wait, that can&#39;t be.Alternatively, the formula is:The minute hand overlaps the hour hand at (60H)/11 minutes past 12:00. For example, for 1:00, it&#39;s (60*1)/11 ≈ 5.4545 minutes past 12:00? Wait, that would be 12:05:27, which is not correct. Wait, no. Maybe past H o&#39;clock.Wait, here&#39;s a correct formula:The hands overlap at 60H/11 minutes past H o&#39;clock. So, for example, at 1 o&#39;clock, they overlap at 60*1/11 ≈ 5.4545 minutes past 1, which is ~1:05:27.Similarly, at 11 o&#39;clock, they overlap at 60*11/11 = 60 minutes past 11, which is 12:00. So, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, between 11:00 and 12:00, the overlap is at 12:00. So, if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, that must have been at 12:00 PM, but that&#39;s not close to 11 AM. So, this is confusing.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a 24-hour format, but 11 AM is 11:00 and 5 PM is 17:00. Still, the overlap at 12:00 is noon, which is 12:00 PM, not close to 11 AM.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s a mistake in the problem statement, and they meant close to 12 PM instead of 11 AM? Or maybe I&#39;m missing something.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; could include times shortly after 11 AM, even though the next overlap is at 12:00 PM. But 12:00 is an hour later, so that&#39;s not close.Alternatively, maybe the problem uses approximate times. For example, if she left at 11:00 AM exactly, even though the hands aren&#39;t overlapping, but close to overlapping. But the problem states &quot;at which time the hour and minute hands overlapped&quot;. So, it has to be exact.Wait, maybe the problem is in a different language, and the translation is off. The original problem might have said &quot;shortly after 11 AM&quot; instead of &quot;close to&quot;. If it&#39;s &quot;shortly after&quot;, then even though the overlap is at 12:00, maybe that&#39;s considered shortly after 11. But an hour later is not shortly after.This is perplexing. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is correct, and the overlap near 11 AM is at 12:00 PM, so she left at 12:00 PM, close to 11 AM? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a miscalculation in my part.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the equations.At t minutes after 11:00, the hour hand is at 330 + 0.5t degrees.The minute hand is at 6t degrees.For them to overlap, 330 + 0.5t = 6t + 360k.We need to solve for t and k such that t is between 0 and 60 (minutes after 11:00), and k is an integer.Rearranged: 330 = 5.5t + 360k.We need 5.5t = 330 - 360k.t = (330 - 360k)/5.5.Looking for t between 0 and 60:Try k=0: t=330/5.5=60. Which is 12:00 PM.k=1: t=(330 - 360)/5.5=(-30)/5.5≈-5.45. Negative, invalid.k=-1: t=(330 +360)/5.5=690/5.5≈125.45. More than 60, invalid.Therefore, the only solution is t=60, which is 12:00 PM. So, the hands overlap at 12:00 PM, which is 60 minutes after 11:00 AM. So, technically, Xiao Hong left home at 12:00 PM, which is close to 11 AM? That doesn&#39;t make sense. Maybe the problem is considering 12:00 PM as close to 11 AM? Probably not. Therefore, there&#39;s a discrepancy here.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in another time zone where the time is slightly different? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s a date change? But the problem says the same day. So, from 11 AM to 5 PM.Wait, maybe the problem is referring to midnight? 11 PM and 5 AM? But the problem says 11 AM and 5 PM.Wait, unless &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; is a translation error, and the original problem meant &quot;shortly after 11 AM&quot;, but even then, the overlap is at 12:00. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and it should be close to 12 PM instead of 11 AM. Then, leaving at 12:00 and returning at 6:00, which is 6 hours, but the answer would be 6 hours. But the problem states close to 5 PM, so probably not.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and we have to accept that the overlap near 11 AM is at 12:00 PM, and the opposite near 5 PM is at 6:00 PM, making the duration 6 hours. But that seems against the problem&#39;s wording.Wait, let&#39;s check the opposite case. When she returns home close to 5 PM, with hands opposite. The opposite times near 5 PM would be calculated similarly.At 5:00 PM, the hour hand is at 150 degrees, minute at 0. To be opposite, the minute hand needs to be at 150 + 180 = 330 degrees. The minute hand moves at 6 degrees per minute, hour at 0.5. The relative speed is 5.5 degrees per minute. The angle to cover is 330 - 0 = 330 degrees. So, time = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, again, at 6:00 PM. But between 5:00 and 6:00 PM, the hands are opposite at 6:00. But according to the online calculator, the opposite time near 5 PM is at ~5:54:32 PM.Wait, conflicting results again. Let me use the equation.Let t be minutes after 5:00 PM.Hour hand position: 150 + 0.5tMinute hand position: 0 + 6tFor them to be opposite, the difference should be 180 degrees:|150 + 0.5t - 6t| = 180So, |150 - 5.5t| = 180Therefore:150 - 5.5t = 180 or 150 - 5.5t = -180Case 1: 150 - 5.5t = 180-5.5t = 30t = -30 / 5.5 ≈ -5.4545 minutes. Negative, invalid.Case 2: 150 - 5.5t = -180-5.5t = -330t = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So, 60 minutes after 5:00 PM is 6:00 PM. Therefore, between 5:00 and 6:00 PM, the hands are opposite only at 6:00 PM. But according to the online calculator, it&#39;s ~5:54:32 PM. Therefore, there&#39;s a conflict here.Wait, but according to my equations, it&#39;s at 6:00 PM. So, which is correct?Wait, at 6:00 PM, the hour hand is at 180 degrees, minute at 0. So, they are opposite. That&#39;s correct. But the online calculator says ~5:54:32 PM. So, which one is it?Wait, perhaps both answers are correct. Because the hands are opposite twice every hour, except at 6:00. Wait, no. Actually, the hands are opposite once every hour, except between 12:00 and 1:00, etc. Wait, no. Let me think.The hands are opposite 11 times every 12 hours. So, similar to overlaps. So, between 12:00 and 12:00, 11 opposite times. So, similar to overlaps, each opposite time is 12/11 hours apart. So, starting from 12:32:43, then 1:38:10, etc., each ~1 hour 5.4545 minutes.But then, how come the equations give 6:00 PM as the opposite time? Because in the case of 6:00, the hands are opposite, but also at 6:00, they are exactly opposite. So, perhaps the formula calculates it once as a special case.Wait, let me use the formula for the opposite times. The formula is similar to overlaps:The time when the hands are opposite is given by:(60H - 30)/5.5 minutes past H o&#39;clock.Wait, for example, at 12:00, H=12:(60*12 -30)/5.5 = (720-30)/5.5=690/5.5≈125.4545 minutes past 12:00, which is 2 hours and 5.4545 minutes, so 2:05:27, but that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe another formula.Alternatively, using the method of angles:At time t minutes after H o&#39;clock, the hour hand is at 30H + 0.5t degrees, the minute hand is at 6t degrees. The angle between them is |30H + 0.5t - 6t| = |30H - 5.5t|. For them to be opposite, set this equal to 180 degrees.So:|30H - 5.5t| = 180So, 30H - 5.5t = 180 or 30H - 5.5t = -180Solving for t:Case 1: 30H - 5.5t = 1805.5t = 30H - 180t = (30H - 180)/5.5Case 2: 30H - 5.5t = -1805.5t = 30H + 180t = (30H + 180)/5.5For H=5 (5 o&#39;clock):Case 1: t=(150 -180)/5.5=(-30)/5.5≈-5.4545 minutes (invalid)Case 2: t=(150 +180)/5.5=330/5.5=60 minutes. So, 60 minutes after 5:00 is 6:00.But according to the online calculator, the opposite time near 5 PM is at ~5:54:32. So, which is correct?Wait, according to the equation, it&#39;s at 6:00 PM. But in reality, the hands are opposite at 5:54:32 PM. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the equation.Wait, perhaps the formula is not absolute. Let&#39;s take t minutes after 12:00. The hour hand is at 0.5*60*H + 0.5*t = 30H + 0.5t degrees. The minute hand is at 6t degrees. The angle between them is |30H + 0.5t - 6t| = |30H - 5.5t|.Set this to 180 degrees:|30H - 5.5t| = 180For H=5 (5 o&#39;clock):|150 -5.5t| = 180Which gives 150 -5.5t = ±180Case 1: 150 -5.5t=180 → t=(150-180)/5.5= -30/5.5≈-5.4545 (invalid)Case 2: 150 -5.5t= -180 → -5.5t= -330 → t=60.So, only at 6:00 PM. But this contradicts the online calculator. Therefore, I think the issue is that the formula gives the times when the hands are exactly opposite, but due to the continuous movement, there should be one time between each hour where they are opposite, except at 6:00 where it&#39;s exact.Wait, but according to the equation, it&#39;s at 6:00. So, maybe the online calculator is wrong? Let&#39;s check with another example.Take H=2. Let&#39;s compute t when hands are opposite.H=2:|60 -5.5t|=180So, 60 -5.5t=180 → t=(60-180)/5.5≈-21.818 (invalid)Or 60 -5.5t=-180 → -5.5t=-240 → t=240/5.5≈43.636 minutes.So, 2:43:38, which matches the online calculator. So, for H=2, the opposite time is ~2:43:38. Similarly, for H=5, it&#39;s at t=60 minutes, which is 6:00 PM. So, according to the formula, at H=5, the opposite time is at 6:00 PM, but according to the online calculator, it&#39;s at ~5:54:32. So, discrepancy. Wait, why?Ah, perhaps the online calculator is using a different formula. Wait, let&#39;s compute for H=5.At t minutes after 5:00, the hour hand is at 150 + 0.5t degrees, the minute hand is at 6t degrees. The angle between them is |150 +0.5t -6t|=|150 -5.5t|. Set equal to 180:150 -5.5t = 180 → t=(150-180)/5.5≈-5.45 (invalid)or 150 -5.5t= -180 → t=(150+180)/5.5=330/5.5=60. So, 60 minutes after 5:00, which is 6:00. Therefore, according to this, the hands are opposite at 6:00 PM. But that&#39;s only once. However, in reality, the hands are opposite once between 5:00 and 6:00, which is at ~5:54:32. So, where is this coming from?Wait, maybe I need to consider another approach. Let&#39;s think in terms of how many minutes after 12:00 the opposite occurs.The formula for opposite times is similar to overlap times. For overlaps, it&#39;s (60H)/11 minutes past H o&#39;clock. For opposite, it&#39;s (60H + 360)/11 minutes past H o&#39;clock? Not sure.Alternatively, the formula for opposite times is:The hands are opposite at (60H - 30)/5.5 minutes past H o&#39;clock.For example, for H=12:(60*12 -30)/5.5=(720-30)/5.5=690/5.5≈125.4545 minutes past 12:00, which is 2:05:27, which matches the online calculator.For H=5:(60*5 -30)/5.5=(300-30)/5.5=270/5.5≈49.09 minutes past 5:00, which is ~5:49:05. But according to the online calculator, it&#39;s at ~5:54:32. So, inconsistency.Wait, maybe different formula. Alternatively, it&#39;s 360H/11 minutes past 12:00.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me use the angle method.At t minutes after 12:00, the hour hand is at 0.5t degrees, the minute hand at 6t degrees. The angle between them is |0.5t -6t|=| -5.5t |. For them to be opposite, |-5.5t|=180 +360k. So,5.5t = 180 +360kt=(180+360k)/5.5For k=0: t=180/5.5≈32.727 minutes → 12:32:43k=1: t=540/5.5≈98.181 minutes → 1:38:10k=2: t=900/5.5≈163.636 minutes → 2:43:38k=3: t=1260/5.5≈229.09 minutes → 3:49:05k=4: t=1620/5.5≈294.54 minutes → 4:54:32k=5: t=1980/5.5=360 minutes →6:00:00So, the opposite times are at 12:32:43, 1:38:10, 2:43:38, 3:49:05, 4:54:32, 6:00:00, etc. So, near 5 PM, the opposite time is at 4:54:32 PM and 6:00 PM. So, if Xiao Hong returned home close to 5 PM, the opposite time near 5 PM is at 4:54:32 PM or 6:00 PM. 4:54:32 is 5 minutes before 5 PM, which is close. 6:00 PM is an hour after 5 PM, which is not close.Therefore, likely the problem refers to 4:54:32 PM as close to 5 PM. So, she left home at 10:54:32 AM (close to 11 AM) and returned at 4:54:32 PM (close to 5 PM). Then, the duration is from ~10:54:32 AM to ~4:54:32 PM. Let&#39;s calculate that.From 10:54:32 AM to 4:54:32 PM is exactly 6 hours. Because from 10:54 AM to 4:54 PM is 6 hours. But she left at 10:54:32 and returned at 4:54:32, which is exactly 6 hours. But wait, the problem says she left close to 11 AM and returned close to 5 PM. So, the duration is from just after 11 AM to just before 5 PM. But according to the overlap times, if she left at the overlap closest to 11 AM, which is at 12:00 PM, and returned at the opposite closest to 5 PM, which is at 6:00 PM, then the duration is 6 hours. But that conflicts with the problem stating &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; and &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;.Alternatively, if we consider the previous overlap before 11 AM, which is at 10:54:32 AM, and the next opposite after 5 PM, which is at 6:00 PM, then the duration is from 10:54:32 AM to 6:00 PM, which is 7 hours and 5 minutes. But that&#39;s longer than the approximate time from 11 AM to 5 PM.Wait, this is very confusing. Maybe I need to accept that the problem is designed with the following times:- Overlap near 11 AM: 12:00 PM (but that&#39;s not near)- Opposite near 5 PM: 6:00 PM (also not near)But then the duration is 6 hours.Alternatively, the problem might have intended the times to be approximate, and the answer is 6 hours.But according to the overlap and opposite times calculated using the equations:Overlap at 12:00 PM, opposite at 6:00 PM, duration 6 hours.But this contradicts the problem&#39;s &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; and &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;.Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach. Let&#39;s try calculating the exact times.For the departure time (overlap near 11 AM):We have to solve 330 + 0.5t = 6t mod 360330 +0.5t =6t330=5.5tt=60 minutes (12:00 PM)For the arrival time (opposite near 5 PM):Solve |150 +0.5t -6t|=180|150 -5.5t|=180150 -5.5t=±180Case 1:150 -5.5t=180 → t= -5.4545 (invalid)Case 2:150 -5.5t=-180 → t=60 minutes (6:00 PM)Thus, according to the equations, the duration is from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 6 hours.But the problem states she left close to 11 AM and returned close to 5 PM. If we take &quot;close to&quot; as approximate, maybe the problem expects the answer 6 hours, even though the overlap is at 12:00 PM and opposite at 6:00 PM. But that&#39;s inconsistent with the problem statement.Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to use the following method:The time between overlaps is 12/11 hours. So, from 12:00, the overlaps are at 12/11, 24/11, ..., 132/11=12 hours. So, near 11 AM, which is at 11 hours, the overlap time would be at 11*12/11=12 hours, which is 12:00 PM. Similarly, the opposite times are at 6/11 hours intervals?No, opposite times should be similar. But regardless, the answer would still be 6 hours.Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have the departure time at 11:00 AM and arrival at 5:00 PM, but with a trick that even though the hands aren&#39;t overlapping/opposite exactly at those times, the duration is 6 hours. But the problem specifically mentions the hands overlapped and were opposite.Given the problem&#39;s wording and the equations giving 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM as the exact times, despite the problem saying &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; and &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;, I think the intended answer is 6 hours.Therefore, the number of hours Xiao Hong stayed out is 6 hours.Final AnswerThe number of hours Xiao Hong stayed out is boxed{6}.&lt;/think&gt;Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hour and minute hands overlapped and returned home close to 5 PM when the hands were in opposite directions. To determine the exact times:1. Overlap Time Calculation (Departure):   - The hour and minute hands overlap every ( frac{12}{11} ) hours.   - The overlap time closest to 11 AM is at 12:00 PM. This is calculated by solving the equation for the hands overlapping:     [     330 + 0.5t = 6t implies 330 = 5.5t implies t = 60 text{ minutes (12:00 PM)}     ]2. Opposite Direction Time Calculation (Return):   - The hands are opposite each other when they are 180 degrees apart.   - The opposite time closest to 5 PM is at 6:00 PM. This is calculated by solving the equation for the hands being opposite:     [     |150 + 0.5t - 6t| = 180 implies |150 - 5.5t| = 180 implies 150 - 5.5t = -180 implies t = 60 text{ minutes (6:00 PM)}     ]3. Duration Calculation:   - Xiao Hong left at 12:00 PM (close to 11 AM) and returned at 6:00 PM (close to 5 PM).   - The duration from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 6 hours.Thus, the number of hours Xiao Hong stayed out is (boxed{6}).,&lt;think&gt;Alright, so I need to figure out how long Xiao Hong was out. She left home when the clock hands overlapped close to 11 AM and came back when they were opposite close to 5 PM. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling how clock angles work. First, the positions of the hour and minute hands. The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so that&#39;s 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 0.5 degrees per minute. So every minute, the minute hand gains 5.5 degrees over the hour hand (since 6 - 0.5 = 5.5). When the hands overlap, the angle between them is 0 degrees. The times when this happens aren&#39;t just every hour; they occur at intervals. Since the minute hand has to catch up to the hour hand, which is moving. The formula for the time when they overlap after 12:00 is something like 60/11 minutes past each hour. Wait, let me think. Starting at 12:00, the first overlap is a bit after 1:05. The exact time can be calculated by setting the angles equal. Let me try that. Let’s denote the time after 12:00 as t minutes. Then, the angle of the hour hand is 0.5 * t degrees, and the minute hand is 6 * t degrees. When they overlap, these angles are equal modulo 360. So:6t ≡ 0.5t (mod 360)Subtracting 0.5t gives:5.5t ≡ 0 (mod 360)So 5.5t = 360k, where k is an integer.Solving for t:t = (360k)/5.5 = (720k)/11 minutes.So the first overlap after 12:00 is at 720/11 ≈ 65.4545 minutes, which is 1 hour and 5.4545 minutes, so approximately 1:05:27. Makes sense.Similarly, the overlaps occur every 720/11 minutes, which is approximately every 65.4545 minutes. So each overlap is 12/11 hours apart. Wait, 720/11 minutes is 12/11 hours, right? Because 720 minutes is 12 hours, so divided by 11, it&#39;s 12/11 hours. So every 12/11 hours, the hands overlap. So between each overlap, it&#39;s 1 hour and 5 and 5/11 minutes.But the question is about overlaps close to 11 AM. So starting from 12:00, overlaps occur at approximately 1:05:27, 2:10:54, etc. But the 11th overlap after 12:00 would be at 12:00 again. Wait, maybe another way.Alternatively, starting from 11:00, when does the overlap happen? At 11:00, the hour hand is at 330 degrees (since each hour is 30 degrees, 11*30=330). The minute hand is at 0 degrees. The minute hand needs to catch up 330 degrees. Since the minute hand gains 5.5 degrees per minute on the hour hand, the time taken to catch up 330 degrees is 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. Wait, that would be at 12:00. But that can&#39;t be right because at 12:00, both hands are overlapping. Wait, but from 11:00, the next overlap is at 12:00. But that contradicts what we had before where overlaps occur every 12/11 hours. Hmm, maybe the formula is different when starting from 11:00?Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. Let&#39;s use the general formula for overlap times. The overlaps occur at times T = 12/11 * k hours, where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 10. So starting from 12:00, the overlaps are at 12:00, 1:05:27, 2:10:54, ..., up to 11:00:00? Wait, but 12/11 * 11 = 12, so that&#39;s 12:00 again. But that doesn&#39;t include 11:00. Wait, maybe the overlaps are at 12:00, then 1:05:27, ..., 10:54:33, and then 12:00 again. So there are 11 overlaps in 12 hours. So between 12:00 and 12:00, there are 11 overlaps. Therefore, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the overlap occurs at 12:00 PM? That seems conflicting.Wait, let me try solving for the overlap time near 11 AM. Let&#39;s set up the equation for the overlap between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM. Let t be the number of minutes after 11:00 AM. The hour hand at 11:00 is at 330 degrees. In t minutes, it moves 0.5t degrees. The minute hand at t minutes after 11:00 is at 6t degrees. For them to overlap:330 + 0.5t = 6t (mod 360)330 = 5.5t (mod 360)But since we are between 11:00 and 12:00, t is between 0 and 60. So:330 + 0.5t = 6t330 = 5.5tt = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes.Wait, that gives t=60 minutes, which is exactly at 12:00 PM. But that seems contradictory because between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the hands don&#39;t overlap until 12:00 PM. But that can&#39;t be right because we know the hands overlap once every hour except between 11:00 and 12:00. Wait, is that true? Wait, actually, no. Between 11:00 and 12:00, the next overlap is indeed at 12:00. So that means after 11:00 AM, the next overlap is at 12:00 PM, then 1:05:27 PM, etc. So if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, that must be at 12:00 PM? But that contradicts &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;. Hmmm. Wait, maybe the problem is in another timezone? No, probably not. Wait, maybe the question is phrased as &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;, meaning around 11 AM but the actual overlap time is slightly after 11?Wait, hold on, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me try again. If we consider that the overlap between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM happens when:Hour hand position: 330 + 0.5t degrees.Minute hand position: 0 + 6t degrees.Set equal:330 + 0.5t = 6t330 = 5.5tt = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes. So that&#39;s 60 minutes after 11:00 AM, which is 12:00 PM. So there is no overlap between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM except at 12:00 PM. Therefore, the overlap just after 11:00 AM is actually at 12:00 PM. Therefore, if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, maybe it&#39;s actually 12:00 PM? But that&#39;s conflicting with the problem statement. Wait, maybe the problem says &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;, so perhaps the overlap was just before 11 AM? Wait, but the previous overlap before 12:00 PM is at 11:00 AM? No, because at 11:00 AM, the hour hand is at 330 degrees, and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. So they don&#39;t overlap. The previous overlap is at 10:54 and something AM. Let&#39;s check.Let me calculate the overlap times. Let&#39;s use the formula T = 12/11 * k hours. For k=0, T=0 (12:00). k=1, 12/11 ≈ 1.0909 hours ≈ 1 hour 5.4545 minutes. k=2, 24/11 ≈ 2.1818 hours ≈ 2 hours 10.909 minutes. Similarly, k=10 would be 120/11 ≈ 10.909 hours ≈ 10 hours 54.545 minutes. So at k=10, the overlap is at 10:54:32.727 AM. Then k=11 would be 12 hours, so 12:00 PM. So between 10:54:32 AM and 12:00 PM, the overlaps occur. So the overlap just before 11 AM would be at 10:54:32 AM, and the next one is at 12:00 PM. Therefore, there is no overlap between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM. Therefore, if Xiao Hong left home close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, that must be the overlap at 10:54:32 AM, but it&#39;s close to 11 AM. So maybe the problem is considering overlaps near 11 AM, which would be at 10:54:32 AM, but that&#39;s 5 and a half minutes before 11. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but I need to follow the given information.Wait, the problem says &quot;left home close to 11 AM, at which time the hour and minute hands overlapped&quot;. So even though the exact overlap is at 10:54:32 AM, since it&#39;s close to 11 AM, maybe it&#39;s considered as around 11 AM? Hmm, that might be. So perhaps the problem is using approximate times, but the exact times need to be calculated. So the departure time is actually at 10:54 and something AM, but close to 11 AM, and the return time is close to 5 PM when the hands are opposite. Similarly, the return time is close to 5 PM, but the exact time when the hands are opposite needs to be calculated.So, to find the exact time when Xiao Hong left and returned, calculate the exact times when the hands overlap near 11 AM and when they are opposite near 5 PM, then find the difference.Let me first calculate the exact departure time. As we saw, between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, the overlap occurs at 10:54:32.727 AM. That&#39;s 10 hours plus 54 and 32.727 minutes. So that&#39;s 10:54:32.727 AM. Then, the problem says she left close to 11 AM, so that&#39;s approximately 10:54 AM, which is 6 minutes before 11 AM. Maybe that&#39;s considered close? Hmm, perhaps in Chinese terms &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; can mean within a 15-minute window? Not sure, but the problem states that at that time, the hands overlapped. So regardless of how close it is, the exact time is 10:54:32.727 AM. But the problem says &quot;close to 11 AM&quot;, so maybe the exact time is actually slightly after 11 AM? Wait, but between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the hands don&#39;t overlap until 12:00 PM. So maybe the problem is in a 12-hour format? Wait, no, the hands overlap 11 times every 12 hours, so there must be one time between 12:00 and 1:00, 1:00 and 2:00, etc., except between 11:00 and 12:00, where the next overlap is at 12:00. Therefore, the overlap just before 12:00 PM is at 10:54:32 AM, and then at 12:00 PM. So if the problem says close to 11 AM, it&#39;s either 10:54 AM or 12:00 PM. But 12:00 PM is 1 hour after 11 AM, so not really close. So maybe the intended time is 10:54:32 AM, which is 5 and a half minutes before 11 AM. Maybe in the problem&#39;s context, that&#39;s considered close to 11 AM. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the next overlap after 11 AM, which is at 12:00 PM, but that&#39;s an hour later. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, let&#39;s check similar problems. In standard clock problems, the times when the hands overlap between 12 and 1, 1 and 2, etc., except between 11 and 12, where the overlap is at 12:00. So, for example, the overlaps are at approximately 12:00, 1:05, 2:10, 3:16, 4:21, 5:27, 6:32, 7:38, 8:43, 9:49, 10:54, and then 12:00. So the overlaps are at each hour plus some minutes, except between 11 and 12, where it&#39;s at 10:54 and then 12:00. So, the overlap near 11 AM is at 10:54 AM, which is close to 11 AM. So maybe the problem is referring to that. So Xiao Hong left home at approximately 10:54 AM (close to 11 AM), when the hands overlapped, and returned close to 5 PM when the hands were opposite.Therefore, the exact departure time is 10:54 and about 33 seconds AM, and the exact return time is sometime close to 5 PM when the hands are opposite.Similarly, we need to calculate the exact time near 5 PM when the hands are opposite. Let me work on that.When the hands are opposite, the angle between them is 180 degrees. The process is similar. Let&#39;s denote the time after 12:00 as t hours. The hour hand is at 30t degrees, and the minute hand is at 360*(t - floor(t)) degrees. The angle between them should be 180 degrees. So, |30t - 360*(t - floor(t))| = 180. Alternatively, since we&#39;re dealing with times close to 5 PM, let&#39;s compute it specifically for around 5 PM.Let’s denote t as the number of minutes after 5:00 PM. The hour hand at 5:00 PM is at 150 degrees (since 5*30=150). In t minutes, it moves 0.5t degrees. The minute hand at t minutes is at 6t degrees. For them to be opposite, the angle between them should be 180 degrees. So:150 + 0.5t = 6t + 180 + 360k (for some integer k) or 150 + 0.5t = 6t - 180 + 360k.But since we&#39;re looking for times close to 5 PM, let&#39;s consider the first occurrence after 5:00 PM. Let&#39;s solve:150 + 0.5t = 6t - 180150 + 180 = 6t - 0.5t330 = 5.5tt = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes.Wait, that gives t=60 minutes, which is 6:00 PM. But at 6:00 PM, the hour hand is at 180 degrees, and the minute hand is at 0 degrees, so they are opposite. But the problem says she returned close to 5 PM. So similar to the overlap case, maybe the opposite direction near 5 PM is actually slightly before 5:00 PM? Wait, let&#39;s check times before 5:00 PM.Wait, but the problem states she returned close to 5 PM, so we need the time when the hands are opposite near 5 PM, which could be either just after 5:00 PM or just before 5:00 PM. Let&#39;s check.At 5:00 PM, the hour hand is at 150 degrees, and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. The angle between them is 150 degrees, not 180. To get 180 degrees, we need to find the time when the minute hand is 180 degrees ahead or behind the hour hand. Let&#39;s solve for t minutes after 5:00 PM.So, equation:|150 + 0.5t - 6t| = 180Which gives two cases:150 + 0.5t - 6t = 180or150 + 0.5t - 6t = -180First case:150 - 5.5t = 180-5.5t = 30t = -30 / 5.5 ≈ -5.4545 minutesNegative t, which is 5 minutes and 27 seconds before 5:00 PM. But she returned close to 5 PM, so that would be 4:54:33 PM. But that&#39;s 5 and a half minutes before 5 PM. Alternatively, the other case:150 + 0.5t - 6t = -180150 - 5.5t = -180-5.5t = -330t = 330 / 5.5 = 60 minutes.So, t=60 minutes after 5:00 PM is 6:00 PM. But again, that&#39;s an hour after 5:00 PM. So the previous opposite time before 5:00 PM is at 4:54:33 PM, but that&#39;s over 5 minutes before 5:00 PM. Wait, so near 5 PM, the hands are opposite at 6:00 PM (which is an hour later) and 4:54:33 PM (which is 5 and a half minutes earlier). But the problem states she returned close to 5 PM. If &quot;close&quot; is within a few minutes, then 4:54:33 PM is 5 and a half minutes before 5 PM. Maybe that&#39;s considered close? Or perhaps 6:00 PM is considered close to 5 PM? That seems less likely. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a 12-hour clock, so 5 PM is also 17:00. But the opposite times occur every 12/11 hours as well? Wait, no, for opposite times, similar to overlaps, they occur 11 times every 12 hours, so the interval between each is 12/11 hours. Let&#39;s see. The formula for opposite times would be similar. Let me recall.The general formula for when the hands are opposite is T = 12/11*(k + 0.5) hours. So for k=0, it&#39;s 12/11*0.5 = 6/11 ≈ 0.5455 hours ≈ 32.727 minutes past 12:00. Then each subsequent opposite time is 12/11 hours later. So 6/11, 18/11, 30/11, ..., up to 126/11 ≈ 11.4545 hours. So, for example:First opposite time after 12:00 is at 12:32:43.636, then at 1:38:10.909, 2:43:38.182, 3:49:05.455, 4:54:32.727, 6:00:00, etc. So near 5 PM, the opposite time is at 4:54:32.727 PM and 6:00:00 PM. Therefore, the opposite time close to 5 PM is at 4:54:32.727 PM (which is 5 and a half minutes before 5 PM) and 6:00 PM. Since the problem states she returned close to 5 PM, it&#39;s likely referring to the 4:54:32 PM time, even though it&#39;s a few minutes before. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the next opposite time after 5 PM, but according to the formula, the next opposite time after 5 PM is at 6:00 PM.Wait, but 4:54:32 PM is technically closer to 5 PM than 6:00 PM. So if she returned home close to 5 PM, the time would be 4:54:32 PM. But this is about 5 and a half minutes before 5 PM. Depending on the definition of &quot;close,&quot; it could be considered. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to take the nearest opposite time to 5 PM, which is 4:54:32 PM. But let&#39;s confirm with the calculation.Let me recast the problem with exact times. If she left home at the overlap time near 11 AM, which is 10:54:32.727 AM, and returned home at the opposite time near 5 PM, which is 4:54:32.727 PM, then the total time she was out is from 10:54:32.727 AM to 4:54:32.727 PM, which is 6 hours. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, if the opposite time is at 6:00 PM, then the duration would be from 10:54:32 AM to 6:00 PM, which is 7 hours and 5 minutes and 27 seconds. But the problem asks for how many hours, so maybe approximately 7.1 hours? But the answer is likely an exact number.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects exact times using the 12/11 formula. Let me check the exact times.First, departure time: overlap near 11 AM. As we saw earlier, overlaps occur at T = 12/11 * k hours. For k=10, that&#39;s 120/11 ≈ 10.909 hours ≈ 10h54m32.727s, which is 10:54:32.727 AM. Then the next overlap is at k=11, which is 12:00 PM. So she left at 10:54:32.727 AM.Return time: opposite near 5 PM. Opposite times occur at T = 12/11*(k + 0.5) hours. For k=5, T = 12/11*5.5 = 6 hours. That&#39;s 6:00 PM. For k=4, T = 12/11*4.5 ≈ 4.909 hours ≈ 4h54m32.727s, which is 4:54:32.727 PM. So the opposite times near 5 PM are at 4:54:32.727 PM and 6:00 PM. So if she returned close to 5 PM, it&#39;s either 4:54:32.727 PM or 6:00 PM. If we take 4:54:32.727 PM, the duration is from 10:54:32.727 AM to 4:54:32.727 PM, which is exactly 6 hours. If we take 6:00 PM, the duration is 7 hours and 5 minutes 27 seconds. But the problem says &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;, so 4:54 is closer than 6:00. However, depending on the problem&#39;s intention, they might consider the first opposite time after 5 PM, but according to the formula, the next opposite time after 4:54:32.727 PM is at 6:00 PM, which is the next one. Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, starting from 12:00, the opposite times are at 12:32:43.636, 1:38:10.909, 2:43:38.182, 3:49:05.455, 4:54:32.727, 6:00:00, 7:05:27.273, etc. So after 4:54:32.727 PM, the next opposite time is at 6:00:00 PM. Therefore, near 5 PM, the only opposite time is at 4:54:32.727 PM and 6:00 PM. Since the problem says &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;, perhaps the intended time is 6:00 PM, but that&#39;s an hour away. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different method.Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact time after 5:00 PM when the hands are opposite. Let me try that.Let t be the number of minutes after 5:00 PM. The hour hand is at 150 + 0.5t degrees. The minute hand is at 6t degrees. The angle between them should be 180 degrees. So:150 + 0.5t = 6t ± 180Let&#39;s solve both equations.First case:150 + 0.5t = 6t - 180150 + 180 = 6t - 0.5t330 = 5.5tt = 60 minutes.So that&#39;s 6:00 PM.Second case:150 + 0.5t = 6t + 180150 - 180 = 6t - 0.5t-30 = 5.5tt = -30 / 5.5 ≈ -5.4545 minutes.Which is 5 minutes and 27 seconds before 5:00 PM, i.e., 4:54:33 PM.Therefore, the two times near 5 PM when the hands are opposite are 4:54:33 PM and 6:00 PM. Given that she returned &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;, the likely answer is 4:54:33 PM. But this is 5 and a half minutes before 5 PM. Depending on the problem&#39;s definition of &quot;close&quot;, but since both times are either side of 5 PM, but 4:54 is closer in time. However, maybe the problem expects us to use the exact times and compute the difference regardless.Therefore, if she left at 10:54:32.727 AM and returned at 4:54:32.727 PM, the total time is 6 hours. But that seems too short. Alternatively, if she left at 10:54:32 AM and returned at 6:00 PM, that&#39;s 7 hours and 5 minutes 27 seconds. However, the problem asks for hours, so maybe rounded or as a fraction.Wait, but let&#39;s calculate the exact time difference.If departure is at 10:54:32.727 AM and return at 4:54:32.727 PM, the duration is 6 hours exactly. Because from 10:54 AM to 4:54 PM is 6 hours. But wait, 10:54 AM to 12:54 PM is 2 hours, then to 4:54 PM is another 4 hours, total 6 hours. So exactly 6 hours. Alternatively, if return is at 6:00 PM, then from 10:54:32 AM to 6:00 PM is 7 hours 5 minutes 27 seconds, which is approximately 7.09 hours.But the problem says &quot;how many hours did Xiao Hong stay out?&quot; It might require an exact fractional answer or a decimal. Let&#39;s check the exact times.First, departure time:Overlap near 11 AM: 10:54:32 + (32.727 seconds). Let&#39;s convert this to hours.10 hours + 54 minutes + 32.727 seconds = 10 + 54/60 + 32.727/3600 ≈ 10 + 0.9 + 0.00909 ≈ 10.90909 hours.Return time:If opposite near 5 PM at 4:54:32.727 PM, which is 16:54:32.727 in 24-hour time. Convert to hours:16 + 54/60 + 32.727/3600 ≈ 16 + 0.9 + 0.00909 ≈ 16.90909 hours.Subtracting departure from return: 16.90909 - 10.90909 = 6 hours exactly.Alternatively, if return is at 6:00 PM, which is 18:00:00 hours, so 18 - 10.90909 ≈ 7.09091 hours, which is 7 + 0.09091*60 ≈ 7 hours 5.4545 minutes.But the problem states she left close to 11 AM and returned close to 5 PM. If we take the exact times when the hands overlapped near 11 AM (10:54:32.727 AM) and opposite near 5 PM (4:54:32.727 PM), the difference is exactly 6 hours. However, 4:54:32 PM is still before 5 PM, but it&#39;s the closest opposite time. If we consider that &quot;close to 5 PM&quot; might mean the next occurrence after 5 PM, which is 6:00 PM, then the duration is approximately 7.09 hours, which is roughly 7 hours and 5 minutes. But the problem asks for the answer in hours, likely as a fraction or a decimal.Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to calculate the precise times and then find the difference, which could result in a fractional number of hours.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s another approach.The time between two consecutive overlaps is 12/11 hours ≈ 1.0909 hours. Similarly, the time between two consecutive opposite times is also 12/11 hours. Therefore, the number of overlaps in 12 hours is 11, and same for opposite times.But since she left near 11 AM and returned near 5 PM, let&#39;s calculate the exact times.First, departure time: Let&#39;s denote H1 as the time she left, close to 11 AM, with overlapping hands.As previously calculated, the overlap before 11 AM is at 10:54:32.727 AM.Return time: Opposite hands near 5 PM. The opposite time before 5 PM is at 4:54:32.727 PM.Thus, the duration is from 10:54:32.727 AM to 4:54:32.727 PM, which is exactly 6 hours.Alternatively, if the problem expects the next opposite time after 5 PM, which is at 6:00 PM, then the duration is from 10:54:32.727 AM to 6:00:00 PM.Calculating that:From 10:54:32.727 AM to 12:00 PM is 1 hour 5 minutes 27.273 seconds.From 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 6 hours.Total: 7 hours 5 minutes 27.273 seconds, which is approximately 7 + 5.4545/60 ≈ 7.09 hours.But the problem asks &quot;how many hours&quot;, so it might want the exact fractional value. Since the duration between 10:54:32.727 and 6:00:00 is 7 + 5.4545/60 hours ≈ 7.0909 hours, which is 7 + 1/11 hours, since 5.4545 minutes is 5 + 5/11 minutes, which is (60*5 +5)/11 = 305/11 minutes = 305/(11*60) hours = 305/660 = 61/132 ≈ 0.4621 hours, but this might not be exact.Wait, alternatively, the difference between the overlap at 10:54:32.727 and the opposite at 6:00 PM.The exact departure time is 10 + 10/11 hours (since each overlap is 12/11 hours apart). Wait, the overlaps occur at 12/11, 24/11, ..., 120/11 hours.Wait, the 10th overlap is at 120/11 ≈ 10.909 hours, which is 10h54m32.727s.The opposite times are at 6/11, 18/11, ..., 126/11 hours. The opposite time at 6:00 PM is at 18/3 = 6 hours, but according to the formula, it&#39;s 12/11*(k + 0.5). For k=5, 12/11*5.5=6 hours. So 6 hours is 12/11*5.5=6. So 6:00 PM is 18:00 hours, which is 18 - 12 = 6 hours in 12-hour format. So the exact opposite time at 6:00 PM is 6 hours after 12:00 PM.Therefore, the duration from departure at 10.909 hours (10:54:32.727 AM) to return at 18 hours (6:00 PM) is 18 - 10.909 ≈ 7.0909 hours. Which is 7 + 1/11 hours. Since 1/11 hours is 5.4545 minutes. So 7 hours and 5 and 5/11 minutes, which is 7 + 5/60 + (5/11)/60 hours. Wait, but this is complicating.Alternatively, since both events (overlap and opposite) are separated by certain intervals. The time between an overlap and the next opposite is half the period between overlaps? Not sure. Alternatively, since overlaps and opposite events are interleaved every 12/22 hours? Maybe not. Alternatively, the time from an overlap to the next opposite is 6/11 hours. Let me see.But maybe we can calculate the difference in times:Departure: 120/11 hours (10:54:32.727 AM)Return: 18 hours (6:00 PM)Difference: 18 - 120/11 = (198 - 120)/11 = 78/11 hours ≈ 7.0909 hours.78 divided by 11 is 7 with remainder 1, so 7 + 1/11 hours, which is 7 hours and approximately 5.4545 minutes. So, 78/11 hours is the exact duration.But the problem asks &quot;how many hours&quot;, so it might want the fractional answer 78/11, which is approximately 7.09 hours, but maybe as a fraction. 78/11 simplifies to 7 1/11 hours.But let me check the other possibility: if she returned at 4:54:32.727 PM, that time is 16.909 hours (16 + 120/11). Wait, 4:54:32.727 is 4 + 54/60 + 32.727/3600 ≈ 4.909 hours. But how is this expressed in terms of the formula?The opposite time near 5 PM is at k=4.5: T = 12/11*(4 + 0.5) = 12/11*4.5 = 54/11 ≈ 4.909 hours, which is 4:54:32.727 PM. So the exact return time is 54/11 hours.Departure time is 120/11 hours. So duration is 54/11 - 120/11 = (54 - 120)/11 = -66/11 = -6 hours. That doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, no, in 24-hour format, 54/11 hours is approximately 4.909 hours, which is 4:54 AM, which is not correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.Wait, in the formula T = 12/11*(k + 0.5), where k=0,1,2,...,10. For opposite times. For k=4, T=12/11*(4 + 0.5)=12/11*4.5=54/11≈4.909 hours≈4h54m32.727s, which is 4:54:32.727 AM or PM. Since we are talking about PM, it&#39;s 4:54:32.727 PM. So in 24-hour time, that&#39;s 16:54:32.727. So the duration from departure at 10:54:32.727 AM (which is 10.909 hours) to return at 16:54:32.727 PM (16.909 hours) is 16.909 - 10.909 = 6 hours exactly.But 16.909 - 10.909 is 6. So, 6 hours. So is that possible? If she left at 10:54:32 AM and returned at 4:54:32 PM, that&#39;s exactly 6 hours apart. But that seems correct. So perhaps the answer is 6 hours.However, in that case, 4:54 PM is considered close to 5 PM. But depending on the problem&#39;s definition of &quot;close,&quot; maybe 6 hours is acceptable. But why does the problem mention &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; and &quot;close to 5 PM&quot;? If the exact times are 10:54 and 4:54, then it&#39;s exactly 6 hours. But 4:54 is 6 minutes before 5 PM, which could be considered close.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different approach. Let&#39;s calculate the exact times using the formulas:For the overlapping time after 11:00 AM:We initially thought it&#39;s at 12:00 PM, but that&#39;s an hour later. However, let&#39;s verify.Wait, starting at 11:00 AM, the hour hand is at 330 degrees. The minute hand at t minutes after 11:00 is at 6t degrees. The equation is:330 + 0.5t = 6t mod 360330 + 0.5t = 6t330 = 5.5tt = 60 minutes.So the overlap is at 12:00 PM. So if Xiao Hong left home at the time when the hands overlapped close to 11 AM, that is at 12:00 PM. Then she returned home close to 5 PM when the hands were opposite. So if she left at 12:00 PM and returned at, say, 5:00 PM, that&#39;s 5 hours. But the problem states she left close to 11 AM, not 12:00 PM. So this is conflicting.But according to the equation, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the hands overlap exactly at 12:00 PM. So if the problem says she left close to 11 AM when the hands overlapped, but the only overlap near 11 AM is at 10:54:32 AM (before 11) or at 12:00 PM (after 11). So if we take 12:00 PM as close to 11 AM, that&#39;s not very close. So this suggests maybe the problem has an error, or perhaps my approach is wrong.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a different time format. Wait, could it be a 24-hour clock? For example, 11 AM is 11:00, and 5 PM is 17:00. But the hands overlapping at 11:00 would be at 11:00 exactly, but the hands overlap at 11:00 only if both hands are at the same position. However, at 11:00, the hour hand is at 11, and the minute hand is at 12. So they don&#39;t overlap. So that can&#39;t be.Alternatively, maybe the problem is not in 12-hour but in 24-hour? But the overlap times would still be the same, just AM/PM.Wait, perhaps the problem is a translation from Chinese, and &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; means shortly after 11 AM. But according to the calculation, the hands overlap at 12:00 PM. So if she left home shortly after 11 AM when the hands overlapped, but the overlap is at 12:00 PM. Then, she returned home close to 5 PM when the hands were opposite. The opposite time near 5 PM is either at 4:54 PM or 6:00 PM. If we take the 6:00 PM as the opposite time, then the duration is from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 6 hours. Alternatively, if the opposite time is at 4:54 PM, then from 12:00 PM to 4:54 PM is 4 hours 54 minutes, which is 4.9 hours. But this doesn&#39;t match with leaving close to 11 AM.This is very confusing. I think there might be a misunderstanding in the problem&#39;s translation. Alternatively, perhaps &quot;close to 11 AM&quot; and &quot;close to 5 PM&quot; are approximate, and we need to calculate the exact times and then find the difference.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total time between the two events (overlap and opposite) occurring closest to 11 AM and 5 PM respectively, regardless of AM/PM. But that seems not the case.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that the hands overlap 11 times in 12 hours, so roughly every 1 hour 5 minutes. So starting from 12:00, the overlaps are at 1:05, 2:10, 3:15, etc. But exact times are slightly different. Similarly, opposite times are every 1 hour 5 minutes as well. But given that, the time difference between the overlap near 11 AM and the opposite near 5 PM would be approximately 6 hours. Because from 11 AM to 5 PM is 6 hours. But with the exact times, it&#39;s 6 hours or 7 hours depending on which opposite time is chosen.Wait, let&#39;s consider that maybe the problem is a simple one and expects approximate answers. For example, if she left around 11 AM and returned around 5 PM, that&#39;s roughly 6 hours. But the exact answer might be 6 hours or 7 hours. But considering the exact times calculated earlier: departure at 10:54:32 AM and return at 4:54:32 PM is exactly 6 hours. Or departure at 12:00 PM and return at 6:00 PM is 6 hours. Alternatively, departure at 10:54:32 AM and return at 6:00 PM is 7 hours 5 minutes. But the problem is worth 5 points, so maybe the answer is 6 hours. But why? Because if you take the exact times when the hands overlap near 11 AM (10:54:32 AM) and opposite near 5 PM (4:54:32 PM), it&#39;s exactly 6 hours. However, if the problem states she left close to 11 AM and returned close to 5 PM, then 6 hours is the exact duration. But if the opposite time is considered at 6:00 PM, then it&#39;s 7 hours. Given the problem states both departure and return times are &quot;close to&quot; the specified hours, perhaps the exact answer is 6 hours. Alternatively, 7 hours. To verify, let&#39;s calculate the precise difference between 10:54:32.727 AM and 4:54:32.727 PM:From 10:54:32 AM to 12:00 PM: 1 hour 5 minutes 27 seconds.From 12:00 PM to 4:54:32 PM: 4 hours 54 minutes 32 seconds.Total: 1h5m27s + 4h54m32s = 5h 100m 0s. Wait, no. 1h + 4h = 5h. 5m +54m=59m. 27s +32s=59s. So total 5h59m59s. Wait, that&#39;s approximately 6 hours. So essentially, it&#39;s 6 hours. Hence, the answer is 6 hours.But if the return time is 6:00 PM, then the duration is approximately 7h5m27s, which is 7.09 hours. But given that the problem mentions both departure and return times are close to the respective hours, but the exact times are the closest occurrences of the events (overlap and opposite), which are at 10:54:32 AM and 4:54:32 PM, exactly 6 hours apart.Therefore, the answer is 6 hours. Therefore, Xiao Hong stayed out for 6 hours.Final Answerboxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Xiao Hong left home when the hour and minute hands overlapped close to 11 AM and returned when they were opposite close to 5 PM. To determine the exact times and duration:1. Calculating the overlap time near 11 AM:   - The hour hand at 11:00 AM is at 330 degrees.   - The minute hand catches up to the hour hand at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.   - The time taken for the minute hand to catch up from 11:00 AM is ( frac{330}{5.5} = 60 ) minutes, which is 12:00 PM. However, this is an hour after 11 AM.   - The previous overlap before 11:00 AM is at 10:54:32.727 AM, which is close to 11 AM.2. Calculating the opposite time near 5 PM:   - The hour hand at 5:00 PM is at 150 degrees.   - The minute hand needs to be 180 degrees apart from the hour hand.   - Solving for the time when the hands are opposite, we find the time is 4:54:32.727 PM, which is close to 5 PM.3. Duration Calculation:   - Departure time: 10:54:32.727 AM   - Return time: 4:54:32.727 PM   - The duration between these two times is exactly 6 hours.Thus, Xiao Hong stayed out for (boxed{6}) hours.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>【Answer】Solution: The minute hand moves frac{360^{circ}}{12}=30^{circ} per hour.When Xiao Hong leaves, the minute hand and the hour hand are 360^{circ}-30^{circ} times 2 times 60^{circ}=300^{circ} apart.When she returns, the minute hand and the hour hand are 30^{circ} times 4=120^{circ} apart.The minute hand has also surpassed the hour hand by 30^{circ} times 4=120^{circ}.It has surpassed the hour hand by another 180^{circ}.Throughout the process, the minute hand has moved 120^{circ}+180^{circ}=300^{circ} more than the hour hand.

I need to make sure I understand each part before jumping into solving them. Let&#39;s start with the first one: proving that f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} is an even function. Hmm, an even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So I need to compute f(-x) and check if it&#39;s equal to f(x). Let me do that step by step.Given f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x}. Then f(-x) would be 2^{-x} + 2^{x}, right? Because replacing x with -x swaps the exponents. So that simplifies to 2^{-x} + 2^x, which is the same as f(x). So f(-x) = f(x), which means it&#39;s even. That seems straightforward. Maybe too straightforward, but I think that&#39;s all there is to it. So part 1 is done.Moving on to part 2. We need to find the expression for the range g(a) of the function y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2a f(x) when x is in [0, infinity). First, let me write down the function again:y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2a(2^x + 2^{-x})I notice that 2^{2x} is (2^x)^2 and 2^{-2x} is (2^{-x})^2. Also, 2^x + 2^{-x} is f(x). So maybe we can express y in terms of f(x). Let me try that.Let’s denote t = 2^x + 2^{-x} = f(x). Then, squaring both sides:t^2 = (2^x + 2^{-x})^2 = 2^{2x} + 2*2^x*2^{-x} + 2^{-2x} = 2^{2x} + 2 + 2^{-2x}Therefore, 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} = t^2 - 2. So substituting back into y:y = (t^2 - 2) - 2a t = t^2 - 2a t - 2So y is a quadratic function in terms of t. Now, since x is in [0, infinity), we need to find the range of t. Let&#39;s see, when x is in [0, infinity), 2^x is in [1, infinity), and 2^{-x} is in (0,1]. So t = 2^x + 2^{-x} is in [2, infinity), because the minimum occurs when x=0, which is 1 + 1 = 2, and as x increases, both 2^x and 2^{-x} go to infinity and 0, so t approaches infinity. Therefore, t &gt;= 2.Therefore, our problem reduces to finding the range of the quadratic function y = t^2 - 2a t - 2 where t &gt;= 2. The range of a quadratic function depends on the vertex and the direction it opens. Since the coefficient of t^2 is 1 (positive), the parabola opens upwards. The vertex occurs at t = -b/(2a) = (2a)/2 = a. Therefore, if the vertex t = a is within the interval [2, infinity), then the minimum value is at t = a, otherwise, the minimum is at the endpoint t = 2. However, we need to analyze two cases: when a &lt;= 2 and when a &gt; 2.Case 1: a &lt;= 2. Then the vertex is at t = a which is less than or equal to 2. Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value on t &gt;= 2 will be at t = 2. So the range is [y(2), infinity).Case 2: a &gt; 2. Then the vertex t = a is in the interval [2, infinity). So the minimum value is at t = a, and since the parabola opens upwards, the range is [y(a), infinity).So let&#39;s compute y(2) and y(a):First, y(t) = t^2 - 2a t - 2So y(2) = (2)^2 - 2a*(2) - 2 = 4 - 4a - 2 = 2 - 4ay(a) = (a)^2 - 2a*(a) - 2 = a^2 - 2a^2 - 2 = -a^2 - 2Therefore, putting it all together:If a &lt;= 2, then the range is [2 - 4a, infinity)If a &gt; 2, then the range is [-a^2 - 2, infinity)Wait, but I need to confirm this. Let me check for a specific value. Suppose a=0. Then y = t^2 - 0 - 2 = t^2 - 2. Since t &gt;=2, the minimum is at t=2, which is 4 -2=2. So the range is [2, infinity). According to the formula for a&lt;=2, 2 -4*0 =2, so that&#39;s correct.If a=3, which is &gt;2, then y(a) = -9 -2= -11. So the minimum is -11. Let&#39;s compute y at t=3: 9 -6*3 -2=9 -18 -2= -11. Then as t increases, y(t) goes to infinity. So the range is [-11, infinity). That seems correct.Therefore, the expression for the range g(a) is:g(a) = [2 -4a, ∞) if a ≤ 2,g(a) = [-a² -2, ∞) if a &gt; 2.Therefore, that&#39;s part 2.Now part 3: If the inequality m f(x) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1 holds for all x ∈ (0, ∞), find the range of m.First, let&#39;s write down the inequality:m*(2^x + 2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1We need to solve for m such that this holds for all x &gt;0.Let me rearrange terms. Let&#39;s bring all terms to one side:m*(2^x + 2^{-x}) - 2^{-x} - m +1 ≤ 0Factor terms with m:m*(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) - 2^{-x} +1 ≤0Alternatively, let&#39;s try to collect like terms:m*(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1Hmm. Let&#39;s see. Let me check:Original inequality:m*(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1Subtract m -1 from both sides:m*(2^x +2^{-x}) - m +1 ≤ 2^{-x} -1Wait, that seems more complicated. Maybe a different approach.Let me isolate m. Let&#39;s try:m*(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1Yes, that&#39;s correct. Because:Original inequality:m*(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1Subtract m from both sides:m*(2^x +2^{-x} -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1So now, for x &gt;0, we have:m ≤ [2^{-x} -1] / [2^x +2^{-x} -1]But we need this to hold for all x &gt;0. Therefore, m must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the right-hand side (RHS) over x &gt;0.Wait, but let&#39;s check the denominator first. Let’s compute denominator D(x) =2^x + 2^{-x} -1.Since 2^x +2^{-x} ≥2 by AM ≥GM, so D(x) ≥2 -1=1. So denominator is always positive. Therefore, the inequality is equivalent to m ≤ [2^{-x} -1]/D(x) for all x &gt;0. Therefore, the maximum lower bound for m is the infimum (greatest lower bound) of the RHS. But since m needs to be less than or equal to RHS for all x &gt;0, the allowable m&#39;s are those less than or equal to the minimum of RHS over x &gt;0.Wait, actually, if m has to be less than or equal to RHS for all x &gt;0, then m must be less than or equal to the infimum (minimum) of RHS over x &gt;0. So we need to find the minimum value of [2^{-x} -1]/[2^x +2^{-x} -1] for x &gt;0, and then m must be ≤ that minimum.Alternatively, maybe the RHS can be expressed in terms of t =2^x, since x&gt;0, so t &gt;1. Let me do substitution.Let t =2^x, so t &gt;1 since x&gt;0. Then 2^{-x} =1/t. So let&#39;s substitute:RHS expression: [1/t -1]/[t +1/t -1]Let me write that as [ (1 - t)/t ] / [ (t^2 +1 -t)/t ] = (1 - t)/t * t/(t^2 -t +1) ) = (1 - t)/(t^2 -t +1 )So RHS simplifies to (1 - t)/(t^2 - t +1) where t &gt;1.So now, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of (1 - t)/(t^2 - t +1) for t &gt;1.Let me denote h(t) = (1 - t)/(t^2 - t +1). We need to find the minimum of h(t) for t &gt;1.To find the extrema, let&#39;s compute derivative h’(t):h(t) = (1 - t)/(t² - t +1)Use quotient rule:h’(t) = [ -1*(t² - t +1) - (1 - t)(2t -1) ] / (t² - t +1)^2Compute numerator:- (t² -t +1) - (1 - t)(2t -1)First term: -t² + t -1Second term: -(1 - t)(2t -1) = -(2t -1 -2t² +t) = -(-2t² +3t -1) = 2t² -3t +1So total numerator:(-t² + t -1) + (2t² -3t +1) = ( -t² +2t² ) + (t -3t ) + ( -1 +1 ) = t² -2t +0 = t² -2tTherefore, h’(t) = (t² -2t)/(t² -t +1)^2Set h’(t) =0:t² -2t=0 =&gt; t(t -2)=0 =&gt; t=0 or t=2. But t&gt;1, so only critical point at t=2.Now check the behavior of h(t):As t approaches 1 from the right (t→1+):h(t) = (1 -1)/(1 -1 +1)=0/1=0.But wait, t&gt;1, so approaching t=1 from the right, h(t) approaches (1 -1)/... which is 0.Wait, actually t=1 is excluded since x&gt;0, so t=2^0=1 is excluded. Wait, no: x ∈ (0, ∞) implies t=2^x ∈ (1, ∞). So t approaches 1 from the right (x approaches 0 from the right). Then h(t) approaches (1 -1)/ (1 -1 +1) =0/1=0.At t=2, h(t) = (1 -2)/(4 -2 +1)= (-1)/3 ≈ -0.333...As t approaches infinity:h(t) = (1 - t)/(t² -t +1) ≈ (-t)/t² = -1/t →0 from below.Therefore, the function h(t) starts at 0 when t approaches 1+, decreases to a minimum at t=2 (h(2)= -1/3), then increases towards 0 as t→infty. Therefore, the minimum value of h(t) is -1/3 at t=2.Therefore, the RHS of the inequality reaches its minimum at -1/3. Therefore, for the original inequality to hold for all x&gt;0, m must be ≤ -1/3.But let me verify this. Let&#39;s check at t=2 (x=1), the RHS is -1/3. So if m ≤ -1/3, then the inequality holds at x=1. For other x&gt;0, since RHS is greater than or equal to -1/3, then if m ≤ -1/3, m will be ≤ RHS everywhere. Therefore, the range of m is (-infty, -1/3].Wait, but let me test m=-1/3 in the original inequality to confirm.Original inequality: m f(x) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1Plug m=-1/3:-1/3*(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} -1/3 -1Simplify RHS: 2^{-x} -4/3LHS: -1/3*(2^x +2^{-x})So inequality becomes:-1/3*(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} -4/3Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:-(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 3*2^{-x} -4Left side: -2^x -2^{-x}Right side: 3*2^{-x} -4Bring all terms to left:-2^x -2^{-x} -3*2^{-x} +4 ≤0Combine like terms:-2^x -4*2^{-x} +4 ≤0Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):2^x +4*2^{-x} -4 ≥0Let me compute this expression: 2^x +4*2^{-x} -4. Let&#39;s check at x=1 (t=2):2 +4*(1/2) -4 =2 +2 -4=0. So equality holds here. For x&gt;0:We can analyze 2^x +4*2^{-x} -4. Let me set u=2^x, u&gt;1. Then expression becomes u +4/u -4. Let&#39;s compute its derivative: 1 -4/u². Setting to zero:1 -4/u²=0 =&gt; u²=4 =&gt; u=2. So critical point at u=2. Then the minimum is at u=2: 2 +4/2 -4=2 +2 -4=0. Therefore, the expression u +4/u -4 &gt;=0 for u&gt;=1. Therefore, equality holds only at u=2, and it&#39;s positive otherwise. Therefore, the inequality 2^x +4*2^{-x} -4 ≥0 holds for all x&gt;0, with equality only at x=1. Therefore, when m=-1/3, the original inequality becomes equality at x=1 and holds with inequality otherwise. Therefore, m=-1/3 is indeed the boundary case.Therefore, the range of m is (-infty, -1/3].Wait, but let me check another value, say m=0. If m=0, the inequality becomes 0 ≤2^{-x} -1, but 2^{-x} -1 &lt;0 for x&gt;0, since 2^{-x} &lt;1. Therefore, 0 ≤ negative number, which is false. So m=0 is not allowed, as expected. If m=-1, which is less than -1/3, let&#39;s test:Left side: -1*(2^x +2^{-x})Right side: 2^{-x} -1 -1=2^{-x}-2So inequality: -2^x -2^{-x} ≤2^{-x}-2Bring all terms to left:-2^x -2^{-x} -2^{-x} +2 ≤0 =&gt; -2^x -2*2^{-x} +2 ≤0Multiply by -1:2^x +2*2^{-x} -2 ≥0Again, set u=2^x:u +2/u -2. Let’s compute its minimum. Derivative:1 -2/u²=0 =&gt; u²=2 =&gt; u=√2. Then the minimum is √2 +2/√2 -2=√2 +√2 -2=2√2 -2≈2.828-2≈0.828&gt;0. Therefore, the expression is always positive, so the inequality holds. Thus, m=-1 works. So seems correct.Therefore, the answer for part 3 is m ≤ -1/3.Final Answer1. boxed{f(x) text{ is even because } f(-x) = f(x)}.2. The range ( g(a) ) is [boxed{begin{cases} [2 - 4a, infty) &amp; text{if } a leq 2, [-a^2 - 2, infty) &amp; text{if } a &gt; 2 end{cases}}]3. The range of ( m ) is boxed{(-infty, -frac{1}{3}]}.&lt;/think&gt;1. To prove that ( f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} ) is an even function, we need to show that ( f(-x) = f(x) ).    [   f(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^x = 2^x + 2^{-x} = f(x)   ]      Therefore, ( f(x) ) is an even function.2. To find the expression for the range ( g(a) ) of the function ( y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2af(x) ) when ( x in [0, +infty) ):   Let ( t = 2^x + 2^{-x} ). Then,    [   t^2 = (2^x + 2^{-x})^2 = 2^{2x} + 2 + 2^{-2x}   ]   which implies    [   2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} = t^2 - 2.   ]   Substituting this into ( y ), we get:   [   y = t^2 - 2 - 2a(2^x + 2^{-x}) = t^2 - 2at - 2.   ]   Since ( x in [0, +infty) ), ( t geq 2 ). The quadratic function ( y = t^2 - 2at - 2 ) has its vertex at ( t = a ).    - If ( a leq 2 ), the minimum value occurs at ( t = 2 ):     [     y(2) = 2^2 - 2a cdot 2 - 2 = 2 - 4a.     ]   - If ( a &gt; 2 ), the minimum value occurs at ( t = a ):     [     y(a) = a^2 - 2a^2 - 2 = -a^2 - 2.     ]   Therefore, the range ( g(a) ) is:   [   boxed{   begin{cases}    [2 - 4a, infty) &amp; text{if } a leq 2,    [-a^2 - 2, infty) &amp; text{if } a &gt; 2    end{cases}   }   ]3. To find the range of ( m ) such that ( mf(x) leq 2^{-x} + m - 1 ) holds for all ( x in (0, +infty) ):   Rearranging the inequality:   [   m(2^x + 2^{-x} - 1) leq 2^{-x} - 1.   ]   Let ( t = 2^x ) (where ( t &gt; 1 )). The inequality becomes:   [   m leq frac{1/t - 1}{t + 1/t - 1} = frac{1 - t}{t^2 - t + 1}.   ]   Let ( h(t) = frac{1 - t}{t^2 - t + 1} ). The minimum value of ( h(t) ) for ( t &gt; 1 ) occurs at ( t = 2 ):   [   h(2) = frac{1 - 2}{4 - 2 + 1} = -frac{1}{3}.   ]   Therefore, the range of ( m ) is:   [   boxed{(-infty, -frac{1}{3}]}   ],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve these three parts about the function f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x}. Let me take them one by one. Starting with part 1: Prove that f(x) is an even function. Hmm, an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x. Let me check that. If I substitute -x into f(x), I get 2^{-x} + 2^{x}, which is the same as the original function. So yeah, f(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^x = f(x). Therefore, f(x) is even. That seems straightforward. I think part 1 is done.Moving on to part 2: Let a be a real number. Find the expression for the range g(a) of the function y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2a f(x) when x is in [0, ∞). First, let me see if I can express y in terms of f(x). Let&#39;s note that 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} is (2^x)^2 + (2^{-x})^2. Also, I recall that (2^x + 2^{-x})^2 = 2^{2x} + 2*2^x*2^{-x} + 2^{-2x} = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} + 2. So that would mean 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} = (f(x))^2 - 2. Therefore, the original function y can be written as (f(x))^2 - 2 - 2a f(x). Let me denote t = f(x). Then, y = t^2 - 2a t - 2. So, we can think of y as a quadratic function in terms of t. But what is the range of t when x is in [0, ∞)? Since x is non-negative, 2^x is at least 1 (since 2^0 = 1), and 2^{-x} is at most 1. So f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} is minimized at x=0 where it&#39;s 2, and as x increases, 2^x increases to infinity, so f(x) tends to infinity. Therefore, t ∈ [2, ∞). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the range of y = t^2 - 2a t - 2 for t ≥ 2. So, since it&#39;s a quadratic in t, we can analyze it. The quadratic is y = t^2 - 2a t - 2. The vertex of this parabola is at t = (2a)/2 = a. Since the coefficient of t^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at t = a. But the domain of t is [2, ∞). So, depending on where a is relative to 2, the minimum of y will be different.Case 1: If a ≥ 2. Then the vertex is at t = a, which is within the domain [2, ∞). Therefore, the minimum value of y is y(a) = a^2 - 2a*a - 2 = a^2 - 2a^2 - 2 = -a^2 - 2. Then as t approaches infinity, y approaches infinity. Therefore, the range is [-a^2 - 2, ∞).Case 2: If a &lt; 2. Then the vertex is at t = a &lt; 2, which is not in the domain. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the left endpoint t = 2. So, y(2) = 2^2 - 2a*2 - 2 = 4 - 4a - 2 = 2 - 4a. Then as t approaches infinity, y approaches infinity. Therefore, the range is [2 - 4a, ∞).Therefore, combining these two cases, the range g(a) is:g(a) = [ -a^2 - 2, ∞ ) if a ≥ 2,andg(a) = [ 2 - 4a, ∞ ) if a &lt; 2.Wait, but the problem says &quot;find the expression for the range g(a)&quot;. So I need to write this as a piecewise function. So:g(a) = [2 - 4a, ∞) when a &lt; 2,andg(a) = [-a² - 2, ∞) when a ≥ 2.That should be the answer for part 2. Let me verify with a specific example. Let&#39;s take a = 3 (which is ≥2). Then y = t² -6t -2. The minimum at t = 3 is 9 - 18 -2 = -11. So the range is [-11, ∞), which matches -a² -2 = -9 -2 = -11. Good. If a=1 (which is &lt;2), then the minimum at t=2 is 2 - 4(1) = -2. So the range is [-2, ∞). If we compute y at t=2: 4 - 2*1*2 -2 = 4 -4 -2 = -2. Correct. So this seems to check out.Now part 3: If the inequality m f(x) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1 holds for all x ∈ (0, ∞), find the range of m.So, need to find all real numbers m such that for all x &gt; 0, m(2^x + 2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1.Let me rearrange the inequality. Let&#39;s bring all terms to the left:m(2^x + 2^{-x}) - 2^{-x} - m + 1 ≤ 0Factor terms:m(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) -2^{-x} +1 ≤0Wait, perhaps another way. Let me group terms with m and constants:m(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1Wait, original inequality:m f(x) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1So subtract m -1 from both sides:m(f(x) -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1But f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x}, so f(x) -1 = 2^x + 2^{-x} -1Therefore:m(2^x + 2^{-x} -1) ≤ 2^{-x} -1So, m ≤ (2^{-x} -1)/(2^x + 2^{-x} -1), provided that 2^x + 2^{-x} -1 &gt;0. Let me check if the denominator is positive for x &gt;0.Since x &gt;0, 2^x &gt;1, 2^{-x} &lt;1. So 2^x + 2^{-x} is greater than 2, so 2^x +2^{-x} -1 is greater than 1. Therefore, denominator is positive. Therefore, the inequality is equivalent to m ≤ (2^{-x} -1)/(2^x +2^{-x} -1) for all x &gt;0.Therefore, m must be less than or equal to the minimum of (2^{-x} -1)/(2^x +2^{-x} -1) over x &gt;0.So, we need to find the minimum value of the function h(x) = (2^{-x} -1)/(2^x +2^{-x} -1) for x &gt;0. Then the range of m is (-∞, min h(x)].Alternatively, maybe rewrite h(x) in terms of t = 2^x. Let me try substitution. Let t = 2^x, so since x &gt;0, t &gt;1. Then 2^{-x} = 1/t. Then h(x) becomes (1/t -1)/(t + 1/t -1).Let&#39;s compute that:( (1 - t)/t ) / ( (t^2 +1 - t)/t ) = (1 - t)/ (t^2 - t +1 )So h(x) = (1 - t)/(t^2 - t +1 ), where t &gt;1.Therefore, h(t) = (1 - t)/(t^2 - t +1 )We need to find the minimum of h(t) for t &gt;1. Wait, since t &gt;1, numerator is 1 - t which is negative, denominator is t² - t +1. Let&#39;s check denominator: discriminant of t² - t +1 is 1 -4 = -3 &lt;0, so denominator is always positive. Therefore, h(t) is negative for t &gt;1. So we need to find the minimum (the most negative value) of h(t) as t approaches infinity or as t approaches 1 from the right.Compute limit as t approaches 1+:h(t) approaches (1 -1)/(1 -1 +1) = 0/1 =0.As t approaches infinity:h(t) ≈ (-t)/(t²) ≈ -1/t → 0.So h(t) approaches 0 from below as t approaches infinity.What&#39;s the behavior in between? Let&#39;s compute derivative of h(t) to find extrema.h(t) = (1 - t)/(t² - t +1 )Compute h&#39;(t) using quotient rule:h’(t) = [ (-1)(t² - t +1 ) - (1 - t)(2t -1) ] / (t² - t +1 )²Compute numerator:- (t² - t +1 ) - (1 - t)(2t -1 )First term: -t² + t -1Second term: -(1 - t)(2t -1) = -(2t -1 -2t² + t) = -(-2t² +3t -1) = 2t² -3t +1Therefore, total numerator:(-t² + t -1) + (2t² -3t +1) = (t² -2t )So h’(t) = (t² -2t ) / (t² - t +1 )²Set h’(t) =0:t² -2t =0 ⇒ t(t -2)=0 ⇒ t=0 or t=2. But t &gt;1, so only critical point at t=2.Therefore, the function h(t) has critical point at t=2. Let&#39;s check the value at t=2:h(2) = (1 -2)/(4 -2 +1) = (-1)/3 ≈ -1/3.Check behavior around t=2:For t approaching 2 from the left (but t&gt;1), say t=1.5:h(1.5) = (1 -1.5)/( (2.25) -1.5 +1 ) = (-0.5)/(1.75) ≈ -0.2857At t=2: -1/3 ≈ -0.3333For t=3:h(3) = (1 -3)/(9 -3 +1) = (-2)/7 ≈ -0.2857So the function h(t) decreases from t=1 to t=2, reaching a minimum at t=2 of -1/3, then increases towards 0 as t approaches infinity. Therefore, the minimum value of h(t) is -1/3 at t=2. Therefore, the minimal value of h(x) is -1/3. Therefore, m must be less than or equal to -1/3.Therefore, the range of m is (-∞, -1/3].Wait, but let me confirm. If the minimum of h(t) is -1/3, then m must be ≤ -1/3 to satisfy m ≤ h(x) for all x &gt;0. Since h(x) can get as low as -1/3, m has to be less than or equal to that minimal value.Alternatively, let&#39;s plug m = -1/3 into the original inequality and check if it holds.Original inequality:m f(x) ≤ 2^{-x} + m -1Plug m = -1/3:(-1/3)(2^x +2^{-x}) ≤ 2^{-x} -1/3 -1Left side: (-1/3)(2^x + 2^{-x})Right side: 2^{-x} -4/3Bring all terms to left:(-1/3)(2^x +2^{-x}) -2^{-x} +4/3 ≤0Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:- (2^x +2^{-x}) - 3*2^{-x} +4 ≤0Simplify:-2^x -2^{-x} -3*2^{-x} +4 = -2^x -4*2^{-x} +4Factor:- (2^x +4*2^{-x}) +4We need to check if this is ≤0 for all x&gt;0.So, need to check if 2^x +4*2^{-x} ≥4 for all x&gt;0.Let’s let t=2^x, so t&gt;1. Then expression becomes t +4/t.We need to check if t +4/t ≥4 for t&gt;1.The function t +4/t has a minimum at t where derivative is 1 -4/t² =0 ⇒ t=2. At t=2, the value is 2 +4/2= 4. Therefore, t +4/t ≥4 for t&gt;0. Therefore, equality holds at t=2 (x=1). Therefore, 2^x +4*2^{-x} ≥4, so -(2^x +4*2^{-x}) +4 ≤0. Therefore, the inequality holds for m=-1/3.Moreover, if m is less than -1/3, say m=-1, then the left side of the original inequality would be even smaller (since m is multiplied by f(x) which is positive), so the inequality would still hold. However, if m &gt; -1/3, then there exists some x where h(x) = (2^{-x}-1)/(2^x +2^{-x}-1) = -1/3 (attained at x=1), so m &gt; -1/3 would not satisfy m ≤ h(x) for all x&gt;0. Therefore, the maximal possible m is -1/3, and m can be any real number less than or equal to -1/3.Therefore, the answer for part 3 is m ≤ -1/3, so the range is (-∞, -1/3].Let me check with x=1. If x=1, f(x)=2 +1/2=2.5. The original inequality: m*2.5 ≤ 1/2 +m -1 ⇒ 2.5m ≤ m -0.5 ⇒ 1.5m ≤ -0.5 ⇒ m ≤ -1/3. So at x=1, m must be ≤ -1/3. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So this seems correct.Final Answer1. boxed{f(x) text{ is even because } f(-x) = f(x)}.2.

The range of ( m ) is boxed{(-infty, -dfrac{1}{3}]}.&lt;/think&gt;1. To prove that ( f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} ) is an even function, we check if ( f(-x) = f(x) ). Substituting (-x) into ( f(x) ), we get:   [   f(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^x = 2^x + 2^{-x} = f(x)   ]   Therefore, ( f(x) ) is even. 2. To find the range ( g(a) ) of the function ( y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2a f(x) ) for ( x in [0, +infty) ), we rewrite ( y ) in terms of ( f(x) ). Note that:   [   2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} = (2^x + 2^{-x})^2 - 2 = (f(x))^2 - 2   ]   Thus, ( y = (f(x))^2 - 2 - 2a f(x) ). Let ( t = f(x) ), then ( y = t^2 - 2at - 2 ). Since ( x in [0, +infty) ), ( t in [2, infty) ). The quadratic function ( y = t^2 - 2at - 2 ) has its vertex at ( t = a ). Depending on the value of ( a ):   - If ( a geq 2 ), the minimum value is at ( t = a ), giving ( y = -a^2 - 2 ).   - If ( a &lt; 2 ), the minimum value is at ( t = 2 ), giving ( y = 2 - 4a ).   Therefore, the range ( g(a) ) is:   [   g(a) = begin{cases}   [2 - 4a, infty) &amp; text{if } a &lt; 2,    [-a^2 - 2, infty) &amp; text{if } a geq 2.   end{cases}   ]3. To find the range of ( m ) such that ( m f(x) leq 2^{-x} + m - 1 ) for all ( x in (0, +infty) ), we rearrange the inequality:   [   m(2^x + 2^{-x} - 1) leq 2^{-x} - 1   ]   Let ( t = 2^x ) (where ( t &gt; 1 )), then the inequality becomes:   [   m leq frac{1/t - 1}{t + 1/t - 1}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   h(t) = frac{1 - t}{t^2 - t + 1}   ]   Analyzing ( h(t) ), we find it has a minimum value of ( -1/3 ) at ( t = 2 ). Therefore, ( m ) must be less than or equal to ( -1/3 ).Final Answers:1. boxed{f(x) text{ is even because } f(-x) = f(x)}.2. boxed{g(a) = begin{cases} [2 - 4a, infty) &amp; text{if } a &lt; 2,  [-a^2 - 2, infty) &amp; text{if } a geq 2. end{cases}}.3. boxed{(-infty, -dfrac{1}{3}]}.]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>Proof for (1):Since the domain of the function f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} is symmetric about the origin, andf(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^x = 2^x + 2^{-x} = f(x),it follows that f(x) is an even function.For (2):Let t = f(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x}.Then t geqslant 2, and 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} = t^2 - 2.Thus,y = 2^{2x} + 2^{-2x} - 2af(x) = t^2 - 2at - 2.When a leqslant 2, at t = 2, the function takes its minimum value 2 - 4a, with no maximum value.

Let me recall how to do that. The projection of b onto a is a vector that points in the direction of a and has a magnitude equal to the scalar projection of b onto a. The formula for the projection vector is (a · b / ||a||²) * a. Let me make sure I remember this correctly. First, compute the dot product of a and b. Then divide that by the square of the magnitude of a. Then multiply this scalar by the vector a. That should give the projection vector. Let me verify this formula. Yeah, I think that&#39;s right. The projection of b onto a is given by proj_a b = (a · b / ||a||²) a. Alright, let&#39;s compute this step by step. Given vectors a = (2, 0, 1) and b = (3, 2, -5). First, compute the dot product a · b. That&#39;s 2*3 + 0*2 + 1*(-5). So that&#39;s 6 + 0 -5 = 1. Wait, 6 -5 is 1. Okay, so a · b = 1.Next, compute the magnitude squared of a. That&#39;s 2² + 0² + 1² = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5. So ||a||² = 5.Then, the scalar multiplier is (a · b)/||a||² = 1/5. So the projection vector is (1/5) times vector a. Since vector a is (2, 0, 1), multiplying by 1/5 gives (2/5, 0, 1/5). So the projection vector is (2/5, 0, 1/5). Let me see the options given.Option C is (1/5)(2, 0, 1), which is the same as (2/5, 0, 1/5). So that&#39;s the projection vector. Option D is (1/38)(2,0,1). Hmm, that would be if the scalar was 1/38 instead of 1/5. So why is there a 1/38? Let me check my calculations again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the dot product or the magnitude of a. Let me double-check. a · b: (2)(3) + (0)(2) + (1)(-5) = 6 + 0 -5 = 1. That seems correct.||a||²: 2² + 0² + 1² = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5. Correct. So the scalar is 1/5. So the projection vector is (1/5)a. That is option C. Then why is there an option D with 1/38? Maybe I confused the projection of a onto b? Wait, no, the question says the projection of b onto a. So projection of b onto a is (a · b / ||a||²) a, which is (1/5)a, which is option C. So the correct answer should be C. But let me check the options again.Wait, the answer options:A: 1/5 (3,2,-5)B: 1/38 (3,2,-5)C: 1/5 (2,0,1)D: 1/38 (2,0,1)So C is indeed (1/5)(2,0,1), which is the projection vector. So I think that&#39;s correct. Let me check once more.Alternatively, sometimes people might confuse the formula with (a · b / ||b||²) b, which would be the projection of a onto b. But the question says projection of b onto a, so we use a in the formula, as we did. So the answer is C. So the options are:C: 1/5*(2,0,1)D: 1/38*(2,0,1)But why is there a 1/38? Maybe someone miscalculates the denominator? Let me compute ||a||² again. 2² +0² +1²=4+0+1=5. So 5. So 1/5. If someone miscalculates ||a|| as sqrt(5), then ||a|| squared is 5. So no, 1/5 is correct. So unless there&#39;s a miscalculation. Wait, is there another formula?Alternatively, maybe the problem is using vector projection formula, which is different? Wait, no, the vector projection is exactly as we have. The scalar projection is |b| cos(theta), which is (a · b)/||a||. But vector projection is that scalar times the unit vector in the direction of a. Which would be (a · b)/||a||² * a. So that&#39;s exactly the formula we used. So yeah, answer is C. So I think that&#39;s correct. But maybe the options are in a different form? Let me check. If they wanted the answer as a vector, then (2/5, 0, 1/5) is equivalent to 1/5*(2,0,1). So option C. So yeah, answer should be C.Wait, but maybe there is a mistake in the problem statement. For example, if vectors were given differently. Wait, in the problem statement, a is (2,0,1) and b is (3,2,-5). Yes, that&#39;s correct. Then the projection of b onto a is (1/5)a. So yes, option C. Therefore, I think the correct answer is C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the projection vector of (overrightarrow{b}) onto (overrightarrow{a}), we use the formula:[text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = left( frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|^2} right) overrightarrow{a}]Given vectors (overrightarrow{a} = (2, 0, 1)) and (overrightarrow{b} = (3, 2, -5)):1. Compute the dot product (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}):   [   overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2 cdot 3 + 0 cdot 2 + 1 cdot (-5) = 6 + 0 - 5 = 1   ]2. Compute the magnitude squared of (overrightarrow{a}):   [   |overrightarrow{a}|^2 = 2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5   ]3. Calculate the scalar multiplier:   [   frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|^2} = frac{1}{5}   ]4. Multiply this scalar by (overrightarrow{a}):   [   text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = frac{1}{5} overrightarrow{a} = frac{1}{5} (2, 0, 1)   ]Thus, the projection vector of (overrightarrow{b}) onto (overrightarrow{a}) is (frac{1}{5}(2, 0, 1)), which corresponds to option C.[boxed{C}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the projection vector of vector b onto vector a. The vectors given are a = (2, 0, 1) and b = (3, 2, -5). The options are A, B, C, D. Let me recall how vector projection works.First, the formula for the projection of vector b onto vector a is proj_a b = ( (a · b) / ||a||² ) * a. Right? So it&#39;s the dot product of a and b divided by the magnitude of a squared, multiplied by the vector a itself. That makes sense because the projection should be a scalar multiple of a, lying in the same direction as a.Let me compute the dot product of a and b first. The dot product is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and then adding them up. So for a = (2, 0, 1) and b = (3, 2, -5):a · b = (2)(3) + (0)(2) + (1)(-5) = 6 + 0 -5 = 1. Okay, so the dot product is 1. That&#39;s straightforward.Next, I need the magnitude of a squared. The magnitude of a is sqrt(2² + 0² + 1²) = sqrt(4 + 0 + 1) = sqrt(5). Therefore, ||a||² is (sqrt(5))² which is 5. Got that.So plugging these into the projection formula: proj_a b = (1 / 5) * a. Since a is (2, 0, 1), multiplying by 1/5 gives (2/5, 0, 1/5). Which is the same as (1/5)(2, 0, 1). Let me check the options again.Option C is 1/5*(2,0,1), which matches what I have here. Option D is 1/38*(2,0,1). Hmm, 38 seems like the squared magnitude if a was different. Wait, maybe I miscalculated something? Let me double-check.Wait, the dot product was 1, ||a||² is 5, so scalar multiplier is 1/5. Then multiplying vector a by that scalar gives 1/5*(2,0,1). So that&#39;s the projection vector. So option C is correct?Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:A: 1/5*(3,2,-5)B: 1/38*(3,2,-5)C: 1/5*(2,0,1)D: 1/38*(2,0,1)So yes, option C is 1/5*(2,0,1), which is exactly what I derived. So why is there an option D with 1/38? Let me see. 38 might be the squared magnitude of vector b? Let&#39;s check. ||b||² = 3² + 2² + (-5)^2 = 9 + 4 +25 = 38. So ||b||² is 38. But the projection formula doesn&#39;t use the magnitude of b, only of a. So that might be a distractor. Similarly, options A and B are scaling vector b instead of a, which is incorrect because the projection should be in the direction of a, not b. Therefore, those are wrong.Therefore, the correct answer must be option C. Let me just confirm once again the steps:1. Compute a · b = 2*3 + 0*2 + 1*(-5) = 6 -5 = 1. Correct.2. Compute ||a||² = 2² +0² +1² =4 +0 +1=5. Correct.3. proj_a b = (1/5)*a = (2/5,0,1/5) = 1/5*(2,0,1). Correct.So yes, option C is the right one. The other options either use the wrong vector (b instead of a) or use the wrong scalar (1/38 instead of 1/5). Hence, the answer should be C.Final Answerboxed{C}&lt;/think&gt;To find the projection vector of (overrightarrow{b}) onto (overrightarrow{a}), we use the formula for the projection of (overrightarrow{b}) onto (overrightarrow{a}):[text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = left( frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|^2} right) overrightarrow{a}]First, compute the dot product (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}):[overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = (2)(3) + (0)(2) + (1)(-5) = 6 + 0 - 5 = 1]Next, compute the magnitude squared of (overrightarrow{a}):[|overrightarrow{a}|^2 = 2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5]Using these values in the projection formula:[text{proj}_{overrightarrow{a}} overrightarrow{b} = left( frac{1}{5} right) overrightarrow{a} = frac{1}{5} (2, 0, 1)]Thus, the projection vector of (overrightarrow{b}) onto (overrightarrow{a}) is (frac{1}{5}(2, 0, 1)), which corresponds to option C.[boxed{C}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-2626c2a0></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2626c2a0><span class="icon" data-v-2626c2a0>🔑:</span>Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=left(2,0,1right) and overrightarrow{b}=left(3,2,-5right), to find the projection vector of vector overrightarrow{b} onto vector overrightarrow{a}, we follow these steps:Step 1: Compute the dot product of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}:overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2 times 3 + 0 times 2 + 1 times (-5) = 6 - 5 = 1.Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{a}:|overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5}.Step 3: Compute the projection of vector overrightarrow{b} onto vector overrightarrow{a}, which is the scalar projection multiplied by the unit vector of overrightarrow{a}:begin{align*}text{projection of } overrightarrow{b} text{ onto } overrightarrow{a} &amp;= frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|^2} times overrightarrow{a} &amp;= frac{1}{sqrt{5}^2} times overrightarrow{a} &amp;= frac{1}{5} times overrightarrow{a} &amp;= frac{1}{5} times (2, 0, 1).end{align*}Therefore, the projection vector of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a} is boxed{frac{1}{5}(2,0,1)}.The correct answer is boxed{text{C}}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-214d4dc7><span data-v-214d4dc7>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
