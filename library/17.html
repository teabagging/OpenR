The condition is that for any two towns connected by a road, there must be a third town that isn&#39;t connected by a road to at least one of the two original towns. Hmm, let me try to parse this.First, let me rephrase the problem in my own words. We have a graph with 100 vertices, representing towns. Some pairs of towns are connected by edges (roads). The condition is that for every edge AB, there exists a third vertex C such that either AC or BC is not an edge. So, for any two connected towns, there&#39;s at least one town that isn&#39;t connected to one of them. The question is asking for the maximum number of edges such a graph can have.Hmm. So, this is a graph theory problem. The key here is probably to model the condition as a graph property and then find the maximum edge count under that property.Let me think. The condition says that for every edge, there&#39;s a vertex not adjacent to at least one endpoint. That seems a bit like saying the graph doesn&#39;t contain a &quot;dominating edge,&quot; meaning an edge where both endpoints are connected to all other vertices. But maybe more formally, it&#39;s a constraint that no edge can be part of a complete subgraph that includes all other vertices? Not sure. Let me see.Alternatively, for every edge AB, the union of the neighborhoods of A and B does not cover the entire remaining graph. So, there&#39;s at least one vertex not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B. So, the union of N(A) and N(B) is not equal to V  {A,B}.So, in graph terms, for every edge AB, there exists a vertex C where C is not adjacent to A or C is not adjacent to B. Therefore, the complement graph has the property that for every edge AB in the original graph, there is a vertex C adjacent to at least one of A or B in the complement graph. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.If in the original graph, C is not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B, then in the complement graph, C is adjacent to A or adjacent to B. So, in the complement graph, for every edge AB in the original graph, there is a vertex C adjacent to A or B in the complement graph. So, the complement graph must be such that every non-edge (original edge) is adjacent to some vertex in the complement. Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe we can relate this to the concept of a graph being &quot;2-clique-covered&quot; or something. But I need to think of another approach.Perhaps a maximal graph with this property would be a complete graph missing some edges. But a complete graph obviously doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition because for any edge AB in a complete graph, every other vertex is connected to both A and B, so there&#39;s no C not connected to A or B. Therefore, the complete graph violates the condition. So, the complete graph is invalid here.Therefore, the maximum number of edges is less than the complete graph&#39;s edge count. So, we need a graph where for every edge AB, there&#39;s at least one vertex not connected to A or not connected to B. So, perhaps the graph cannot contain a &quot;universal&quot; edge, meaning an edge whose endpoints are connected to all other vertices. But even if just one vertex is missing, that might satisfy the condition.Wait, so if in the graph, every edge has at least one vertex not connected to one of its endpoints. So, maybe the graph can be such that every edge is missing at least one connection. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the graph is triangle-free? But no, triangle-free graphs have a different condition. Let&#39;s see: in a triangle-free graph, for any edge AB, there is no vertex C connected to both A and B. But here, the condition is that there is a vertex C not connected to at least one of A or B. So, triangle-free is a stronger condition because it requires that no C is connected to both, which would automatically satisfy the given condition here. But the converse is not true. So, triangle-free graphs satisfy the given condition, but the given condition allows for some triangles as long as for every edge, there&#39;s at least one vertex not connected to one of its endpoints.Therefore, maybe this problem allows for more edges than a triangle-free graph. The maximum triangle-free graph (which is a complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible) on n=100 vertices has at most floor(n²/4) edges, which is 2500. But perhaps here we can have more edges.Alternatively, maybe the graph is something like a complete graph minus a matching. Wait, but if we remove a matching from a complete graph, we still have a lot of edges, but does that satisfy the condition?Wait, let&#39;s take a small example. Suppose we have 4 towns. Let&#39;s say the complete graph has 6 edges. If we remove a matching of two edges, so the remaining graph has 4 edges. Let&#39;s check the condition.Take any edge in the remaining graph. For each edge AB, is there a town C not connected to A or not connected to B? In the complete graph minus a matching, suppose edges AB and CD are removed. Then, in the remaining graph, for edge AC, is there a town not connected to A or C? A is connected to C (since we only removed AB and CD). So, A is connected to C, D. C is connected to A, B, D. So, the neighbors of A are C, D; neighbors of C are A, B, D. The union is A, B, C, D. Wait, but all towns are in the union. So, there is no town not connected to A or C. So, the edge AC would violate the condition. Therefore, that graph does not satisfy the condition.Therefore, removing a matching is not sufficient. So, maybe another approach.Alternatively, consider a graph that is not universal, meaning no vertex is connected to all others. If there is a vertex connected to all others, then any edge connected to that universal vertex would have the other endpoint. For example, if U is a universal vertex, then for any edge UB, we need a town C not connected to U or not connected to B. But since U is connected to everyone, C must not be connected to B. So, for each neighbor B of U, there must be some town not connected to B. Therefore, if we have a universal vertex, all its neighbors must have non-universal degree. But maybe having a universal vertex complicates things.Alternatively, maybe the graph is such that it&#39;s the union of two complete graphs. Wait, but union of two complete graphs would mean that within each complete graph, every edge is present. Then, for an edge within one of the complete graphs, we need a town not connected to one of the endpoints. But if the two complete graphs are separate, then a town in the other complete graph is not connected to either endpoint. Wait, no. If it&#39;s the union of two complete graphs, then the towns in the other complete graph are not connected to the towns in the first complete graph. So, take an edge AB in the first complete graph. Then, any town C in the second complete graph is not connected to A or B (since there are no edges between the two complete graphs). Therefore, such a graph would satisfy the condition. The number of edges would be the sum of edges within each complete graph.But if we split the 100 towns into two equal parts, each of 50 towns, then each complete graph would have C(50,2) edges, so total edges would be 2*1225 = 2450. But if we make one complete graph larger, say 51 and 49, then the total edges would be C(51,2) + C(49,2) = (51*50)/2 + (49*48)/2 = 1275 + 1176 = 2451, which is slightly more. So, the maximum is achieved when the partition is as equal as possible. However, is this the maximum possible?Wait, but maybe we can have a graph with more edges. For example, suppose we have a complete graph missing only a few edges. Wait, but as in the previous example, if we have a complete graph missing a matching, we might not satisfy the condition. Alternatively, maybe a graph where each vertex is missing just one connection.Wait, let&#39;s think about the complement graph. If in the original graph, for every edge AB, there is a vertex not adjacent to A or B, then in the complement graph, for every non-edge AB, there is a vertex adjacent to A or B in the complement. Wait, that might not be directly useful.Alternatively, think in terms of the complement. The complement graph has the property that every non-edge in the original graph (which is an edge in the complement) has a vertex adjacent to at least one of its endpoints in the complement. But I need to formalize this.Alternatively, maybe the complement graph has no isolated edges. An isolated edge in the complement would correspond to a non-edge in the original graph that is not adjacent (in the complement) to any other edge. Wait, maybe not. Let me see.Wait, the original problem&#39;s condition is: for every edge AB in the original graph, there exists a vertex C such that C is not adjacent to A or C is not adjacent to B in the original graph. In terms of the complement graph, which I&#39;ll denote as overline{G}, this means that for every non-edge AB in overline{G}, there exists a vertex C such that C is adjacent to A or C is adjacent to B in overline{G}. In other words, in the complement graph, every edge is adjacent to some other edge. Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Wait, original graph G has an edge AB. The complement graph overline{G} does not have AB as an edge. The condition is that in G, for AB, there&#39;s a C such that AC or BC is not in G. In overline{G}, that translates to: for every non-edge AB in overline{G}, there&#39;s a C such that AC or BC is an edge in overline{G}. So, in overline{G}, every non-edge is adjacent to some edge. Hmm.Alternatively, in overline{G}, the closed neighborhoods of the non-edges cover the vertex set. Wait, maybe this is equivalent to saying that the complement graph overline{G} is such that every pair of non-adjacent vertices in overline{G} (which correspond to edges in G) have a common neighbor in overline{G}. Wait, no. The condition is that for every non-edge AB in overline{G}, there is a vertex C adjacent to A or adjacent to B in overline{G}. So, each non-edge in overline{G} is contained in the neighborhood of some vertex. So, the complement graph overline{G} must be such that every non-edge is contained in the neighborhood of a vertex. Hmm, that seems similar to the complement graph being a line graph or something else. I might need to recall some graph theory concepts here.Alternatively, maybe this condition in the complement graph overline{G} is that every edge in G (non-edge in overline{G}) is dominated by some vertex in overline{G}. So, for every edge in G, which is a non-edge in overline{G}, there is a vertex in overline{G} adjacent to at least one endpoint of that non-edge.This is equivalent to saying that overline{G} is a dominating graph for the non-edges of G. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the complement graph must be a vertex cover for the non-edges? Not sure.Alternatively, let me consider that in overline{G}, the set of edges is such that every non-edge in overline{G} (which is an edge in G) is adjacent to some vertex in overline{G}. Wait, adjacency in the complement graph is different. Let me clarify:In the original graph G, AB is an edge. The condition is that there exists a vertex C such that either AC is not an edge or BC is not an edge. In terms of overline{G}, which has edges where G does not, this means that either AC is an edge in overline{G} or BC is an edge in overline{G}. So, for every non-edge AB in overline{G}, there is a vertex C such that AC or BC is an edge in overline{G}. So, in other words, for every non-edge AB in overline{G}, the pair AB is contained in the neighborhood of some vertex C in overline{G}. Because if AC is an edge in overline{G}, then in overline{G}, C is adjacent to A, so AB is in the neighborhood of C. Wait, not exactly. If AB is a non-edge in overline{G}, then A and B are not adjacent in overline{G}, but if there is a C adjacent to A or B in overline{G}, then C covers that non-edge? Not sure.Wait, perhaps another angle. Let&#39;s think in terms of hypergraphs. If we consider each non-edge in overline{G} as a hyperedge, then the condition is that every hyperedge is covered by some vertex, meaning that for every hyperedge AB, there exists a vertex C such that C is adjacent to A or B in overline{G}, i.e., C covers the hyperedge AB. So, this is equivalent to saying that the hypergraph has a vertex cover of size 1 for each hyperedge. But that&#39;s trivially true because for each hyperedge AB, we can pick C = A or C = B. Wait, but in this case, in overline{G}, if AB is a hyperedge (non-edge in overline{G}), then C must be adjacent to A or B in overline{G}. But if C is adjacent to A in overline{G}, that means AC is an edge in overline{G}, i.e., AC is a non-edge in G. So, in G, AC is not an edge. Therefore, the condition is that for every edge AB in G, there is a vertex C such that either AC is not an edge or BC is not an edge in G. Which is exactly the original condition.But how does this help? Maybe not much. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose we consider that in graph G, for every edge AB, there is some vertex not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B. Therefore, the graph does not contain a copy of K_{2, n-2} as a subgraph, where two vertices are connected to all others. Wait, but K_{2, n-2} would have two vertices connected to everyone else. Then, for the edge between those two vertices, we need a vertex not connected to at least one. But in K_{2, n-2}, those two vertices are connected to everyone, so every other vertex is connected to both. Therefore, for the edge between the two hubs, there is no vertex C not connected to at least one. Therefore, such a graph would violate the condition. Therefore, G cannot have two vertices connected to all others. Similarly, even a single universal vertex would cause problems for edges connected to it.Wait, suppose there is a universal vertex U connected to everyone. Then, for any edge UB (where B is another vertex), we need a vertex C not connected to U or not connected to B. But since U is connected to everyone, C must not be connected to B. Therefore, every neighbor of U must have at least one non-neighbor. So, if there is a universal vertex, all other vertices must have degree at most 98 (since they can&#39;t be connected to everyone, as they have to not be connected to at least one vertex). But the problem is, the edges adjacent to U would require that each neighbor of U has at least one non-neighbor. But maybe that&#39;s possible. For example, if U is connected to everyone, but each of the other 99 vertices has one non-neighbor. Then, for each edge UB, there exists a C (the non-neighbor of B) such that C is not connected to B. Therefore, that would satisfy the condition. So, in this case, the total number of edges would be 99 (from U) plus the edges among the remaining 99 vertices. Each of the remaining 99 vertices has degree 98 (connected to everyone except one). So, each has degree 98, but since they are missing one connection, the total edges among them would be (99*98)/2 minus 99/2, but since each non-edge is counted once. Wait, if each of the 99 vertices has exactly one non-neighbor, and each non-neighbor is unique, then we would have 99 non-edges. But 99 is an odd number, so you can&#39;t have each non-edge being unique because each non-edge is between two vertices. So, actually, if each vertex has one non-neighbor, you need the non-edges to form a matching or some other structure. But if you have 99 vertices, each missing one edge, then the number of non-edges would be 99/2, which is not an integer. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible. So, you can&#39;t have each of the 99 vertices missing exactly one edge. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex missing two edges. Therefore, this approach might not be the most efficient.Alternatively, maybe having a universal vertex is not optimal. Let&#39;s compare two cases: one with a universal vertex and one without.Case 1: Universal vertex U. Then, U is connected to all 99 others. Each of the other 99 vertices must have at least one non-neighbor among the rest. The total edges would be 99 (from U) plus the edges among the other 99. The maximum number of edges among the other 99 is C(99,2) minus the number of non-edges required. Since each of the 99 vertices must have at least one non-neighbor, the minimum number of non-edges is ceiling(99/2), since each non-edge can account for two vertices. Wait, the minimum number of non-edges needed so that each vertex has at least one non-neighbor is ceiling(n/2) where n=99. So, ceiling(99/2) = 50. Therefore, the maximum number of edges among the 99 vertices is C(99,2) - 50 = (99*98)/2 - 50 = 4851 - 50 = 4801. Therefore, total edges in the graph would be 99 + 4801 = 4900. Hmm, 4900 edges.Case 2: No universal vertex. Maybe split the graph into two parts. Suppose we split the 100 vertices into two sets of 50 each, and make each set a complete graph. Then, the total edges would be 2*C(50,2) = 2*1225 = 2450. But this is much less than 4900. So, Case 1 seems better.Wait, but 4900 is actually the total number of edges in the case with a universal vertex. Wait, 99 edges from the universal vertex to others, and 4801 edges among the remaining 99. Wait, 99 + 4801 = 4900. However, the total number of possible edges in a complete graph is C(100,2) = 4950. So, 4950 - 4900 = 50 edges missing. So, only 50 edges are missing. But is this correct?Wait, if we have a universal vertex connected to everyone, and the remaining 99 vertices form a graph where each has exactly one non-neighbor, but since 99 is odd, we can&#39;t have each non-neighbor unique. So, actually, the minimal number of non-edges needed is 50 (since 99*1 = 99 non-edges required, but each non-edge covers two vertices, so ceiling(99/2) = 50). Wait, but 50 non-edges would cover 100 vertex deficiencies, but we need only 99. So, maybe 50 non-edges would cover 100 &quot;needs,&quot; but we have 99. So, actually, 49.5 non-edges, but since we can&#39;t have half, it&#39;s 50. Therefore, the number of non-edges is 50. Therefore, the number of edges among the 99 vertices is C(99,2) - 50 = 4851 - 50 = 4801. Then, adding the 99 edges from the universal vertex, we get 99 + 4801 = 4900 edges. So, total edges 4900.But is this graph satisfying the original condition? Let&#39;s verify. Take any edge AB in G. If AB is an edge connected to the universal vertex, say UA, then we need a town C not connected to U or not connected to A. Since U is connected to everyone, C must not be connected to A. But in the remaining 99 vertices, each has exactly one non-neighbor. Therefore, A is missing exactly one connection among the 99. Therefore, there exists a C such that AC is not an edge. Therefore, the condition is satisfied for edge UA. For edges among the remaining 99 vertices, take an edge AB in the 99-vertex graph. Each of A and B is missing one connection. Let&#39;s say A is not connected to C, and B is not connected to D. Then, either C or D is not connected to A or B. Wait, but AB is an edge. If we need a town not connected to A or not connected to B. Since A is missing C, and B is missing D. If C ≠ D, then C is not connected to A, so C is the town not connected to A. If C = D, then C is not connected to both A and B. So, in that case, C is not connected to both. Therefore, for edge AB, C is not connected to A or B. Therefore, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, this graph does satisfy the condition. Therefore, 4900 edges is possible.But is this the maximum?Wait, suppose we try to have two universal vertices. Let&#39;s say U and V are both connected to all others. Then, for the edge UV, we need a town C not connected to U or not connected to V. But U and V are connected to everyone, so C would have to not be connected to both, but since they are universal, there is no such C. Therefore, the edge UV would violate the condition. Therefore, we cannot have two universal vertices. So, at most one universal vertex.Therefore, the graph with one universal vertex and the remaining 99 vertices each missing one connection seems valid. But, is there a way to have more edges?Wait, if instead of having each of the 99 vertices missing one connection, we have some vertices missing more and some missing less. But if we want to maximize the number of edges, we need as few non-edges as possible. The minimal number of non-edges required is 50, as we calculated, but perhaps arranging them cleverly could allow more edges? Wait, no. The minimal number of non-edges required is ceil(n/2) where n is the number of vertices that need to have at least one non-neighbor. In this case, n=99, so ceil(99/2)=50. Therefore, we need at least 50 non-edges. Therefore, the maximum number of edges among the 99 vertices is C(99,2) - 50 = 4801. Therefore, that seems like the maximum.Therefore, total edges in the graph would be 99 + 4801 = 4900. But let&#39;s check with another configuration. Suppose instead of one universal vertex, we have two vertices, each connected to 98 others. Then, maybe?Wait, let&#39;s say we have two vertices, U and V. U is connected to everyone except V, and V is connected to everyone except U. Then, the edge UV does not exist, but all other edges from U and V are present. Then, among the remaining 98 vertices, we can have a complete graph. Then, total edges would be:From U: 98 edges.From V: 98 edges.Among the remaining 98 vertices: C(98,2) edges.But we also need to consider edges between U&#39;s neighbors and V&#39;s neighbors. Wait, since U is connected to everyone except V, and V is connected to everyone except U, then U is connected to the 98 other towns, and V is also connected to the 98 other towns. Therefore, the total edges from U and V are 98 + 98 = 196, but since the edge between U and V is missing, that&#39;s okay. The remaining 98 towns form a complete graph, contributing C(98,2) edges. Therefore, total edges would be 196 + C(98,2) = 196 + (98*97)/2 = 196 + 4753 = 4949. Wait, that&#39;s 4949 edges, which is almost the complete graph. But does this graph satisfy the condition?Take any edge AB in the graph. If AB is among the 98 towns, then we need a town C not connected to A or B. But the 98 towns form a complete graph, so every town is connected to both A and B. The only towns not connected to A or B are U and V. But U is connected to everyone except V, and V is connected to everyone except U. So, U is connected to A and B (since A and B are in the 98 towns). Similarly, V is connected to A and B. Therefore, there is no town not connected to A or B. Therefore, edges among the 98 towns violate the condition. Therefore, this configuration is invalid.Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, the previous idea of having a universal vertex and 99 others each missing one edge is better. Let&#39;s go back to that.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the graph as a complete graph missing 50 edges. The total edges would be 4950 - 50 = 4900. If those 50 missing edges are arranged such that each of the 99 non-universal vertices is missing exactly one edge, then the condition is satisfied. Because for any edge in the graph, if it&#39;s connected to the universal vertex, then the non-connection is in the other part. If it&#39;s among the 99, then the missing edges are such that each vertex has one non-neighbor, so for any edge AB, there exists a C not connected to A (the one non-neighbor of A). Therefore, that C is not connected to A, satisfying the condition.Therefore, this seems like a valid construction. Now, is there a way to have a graph with more edges? For example, if we have a universal vertex and 99 others missing only 0.5 edges each, but that&#39;s impossible.Alternatively, suppose we have a graph where almost all vertices are universal except a few. Wait, but even two universal vertices would create a problem as discussed before.Alternatively, perhaps using a different structure. Let&#39;s consider the problem again. For every edge AB, there must be a vertex C not adjacent to A or B. So, for every edge AB, the closed neighborhoods of A and B do not cover the entire vertex set. Therefore, the union of N(A) and N(B) is not equal to V  {A,B}.Therefore, in other words, for every edge AB, there is at least one vertex not adjacent to A and not adjacent to B. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that there&#39;s a vertex not adjacent to at least one of A or B. So, it could be not adjacent to A, not adjacent to B, or not adjacent to both. So, the union of N(A) and N(B) is not the entire vertex set. Therefore, the complement of N(A) union N(B) is non-empty. So, the intersection of the complements of N(A) and N(B) is non-empty. Wait, that is, there exists a vertex adjacent to neither A nor B.Wait, now this is different from what I thought before. If the condition is that for every edge AB, there exists a vertex C not adjacent to A and not adjacent to B, then that&#39;s a stronger condition. But the original problem states: &quot;a town C which is not connected by a road with at least one of the towns A and B&quot;. So, it&#39;s at least one, not both. So, the correct interpretation is that there exists a C such that C is not adjacent to A or C is not adjacent to B (inclusive or). Therefore, the union of the non-neighbors of A and the non-neighbors of B is non-empty. So, in other words, the union of the complements of N(A) and N(B) is non-empty. Which is equivalent to saying that the intersection of N(A) and N(B) is not the entire vertex set. So, there exists a vertex not in N(A) ∩ N(B). Wait, but N(A) ∩ N(B) is the set of vertices adjacent to both A and B. So, the complement is the set of vertices not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B. So, the condition is that the complement of N(A) ∩ N(B) is non-empty. Which is always true unless N(A) ∩ N(B) is the entire vertex set. So, the condition is that N(A) ∩ N(B) ≠ V  {A,B}. Therefore, that is, the common neighbors of A and B do not include all other vertices. So, there is at least one vertex not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B.Therefore, in other words, for any edge AB, you cannot have that A and B are both connected to all other vertices. So, there is no edge AB such that A and B are both universal. But the problem allows for one universal vertex, as we had before.Wait, if there is a universal vertex U, connected to everyone, then any edge UB (where B is another vertex) must have a town not adjacent to U or not adjacent to B. Since U is connected to everyone, the town must be not adjacent to B. So, every neighbor of U (which is everyone except U) must have at least one non-neighbor. Therefore, as before, each of the other 99 vertices must have at least one non-neighbor. Therefore, requiring at least 50 non-edges among the 99 vertices, leading to 4900 total edges.But let&#39;s confirm with another example. Take a graph with 4 vertices. Let’s say we have a universal vertex U connected to A, B, C. Then, each of A, B, C must have at least one non-neighbor. Suppose A is not connected to B, B is not connected to C, and C is not connected to A. Then, the edges among A, B, C are: none? Wait, no. Wait, if each has one non-neighbor, but in a triangle. Wait, maybe A not connected to B, B not connected to C, C not connected to A. Then, the non-edges are AB, BC, CA. So, in this case, each of A, B, C has two non-neighbors. But we only needed each to have one. So, this is overkill. Alternatively, let&#39;s have A not connected to B, and C connected to everyone. Wait, but C is connected to U, A, B. So, C is connected to all. Then, for edge UA, we need a town not connected to U or A. U is connected to everyone, so must be a town not connected to A. That town is B. Because A is not connected to B. Similarly, for edge UB, town A is not connected to B. For edge UC, since C is connected to everyone, need a town not connected to C. But C is connected to everyone, so there is no such town. Wait, so in this case, the edge UC would violate the condition. Therefore, my previous assumption is invalid. Therefore, in this small example, having a universal vertex and another vertex connected to all except one doesn&#39;t work because the edge between the universal and the almost-universal vertex would require a town not connected to either, which doesn&#39;t exist.Therefore, in the case of a universal vertex U, all other vertices must have at least one non-neighbor among the non-U vertices. So, in the 4-vertex example, if U is connected to A, B, C, and each of A, B, C must have at least one non-neighbor. So, if A is not connected to B, B is not connected to C, and C is not connected to A, then each has one non-neighbor. Then, for edge UA, town B is not connected to A; for edge UB, town C is not connected to B; for edge UC, town A is not connected to C. Then, the edges among A, B, C: since A is not connected to B, B not connected to C, and C not connected to A, there are no edges among them. So, total edges: 3 (from U) + 0 = 3. But the maximum possible in this case. Alternatively, if two of them are connected. Suppose A is connected to B, but A is not connected to C, and B is not connected to C. Then, the edges among A, B, C are AB. Then, for edge UA, we need a town not connected to U or A. Since U is connected to everyone, need a town not connected to A, which is C. For edge UB, similarly, town not connected to B is C. For edge UC, town not connected to C is A or B. For edge AB, we need a town not connected to A or B. The towns are U, C. U is connected to both, C is not connected to A and B. Therefore, C is not connected to both. So, C is not connected to at least one (actually both). Therefore, it&#39;s okay. So, this works. Then, total edges: 3 (from U) + 1 (AB) = 4. The total edges in a 4-vertex graph is 6. So, 6 - 2 non-edges. So, in this case, 4 edges. But maybe we can do better.Alternatively, if U is connected to A, B, C. A is connected to B and C, B is connected to C. So, the non-edges: none among A, B, C. Then, for edge UA, need a town not connected to A. But A is connected to everyone, so no such town. Therefore, this graph doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, let&#39;s have U connected to A, B, C. A connected to B and C, B connected to C. Then, non-edges: none. Then, edge UA has no town not connected to A. Therefore, invalid. So, that&#39;s no good.Alternatively, have U connected to A, B, C. A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to A. So, forming a triangle. Then, for edge UA, need a town not connected to A. Since A is connected to U, B, C. Wait, no. In this case, A is connected to U, B, C. So, there is no town not connected to A. Therefore, edge UA violates the condition. Therefore, invalid.Therefore, in the 4-vertex case, the maximum number of edges is 4, achieved by the universal vertex connected to three others, with one edge among the others and two non-edges. But wait, in the previous example, with edges UA, UB, UC, AB, and non-edges AC, BC. Wait, no. Let me recast.Wait, in the 4-vertex example, with U connected to A, B, C. A connected to B, B connected to C, and C connected to A. Then, each of A, B, C has degree 3 (connected to U and two others). Therefore, the edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, BC, CA. Wait, but that&#39;s a complete graph. Then, every edge would require a town not connected to at least one endpoint. But in the complete graph, every town is connected to everyone. Therefore, for any edge AB, there is no town not connected to A or B. Therefore, the complete graph doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. So, that approach doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if we have U connected to A, B, C; A connected to B; B connected to C; and C not connected to A. Then, edges: UA, UB, UC, AB, BC. Non-edges: AC. For edge UA, need a town not connected to U or A. Since U is connected to all, need a town not connected to A. That&#39;s C. For edge UB, town not connected to B is C (but C is connected to B). Wait, no. Wait, in this graph, C is connected to B and U, but not to A. Therefore, for edge UB, need a town not connected to U or B. U is connected to all, so town not connected to B. Which is none, since B is connected to U, A, C. So, this is a problem. Therefore, edge UB violates the condition. Therefore, this graph is invalid.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe in small cases, the maximum is achieved by the star graph plus some edges, but with careful non-edges. But in the 4-node example, the maximum seems to be 4 edges. Let me check.If we have a graph with edges UA, UB, UC, AB. Then, non-edges: AC, BC, UU. For edge UA, town C is not connected to A. For edge UB, town C is not connected to B. For edge UC, town A is not connected to C. For edge AB, town C is not connected to A or B. Therefore, this works. So, total edges: 4. This satisfies the condition. But is there a way to have 5 edges? If we add another edge, say BC, then for edge BC, we need a town not connected to B or C. Towns are U, A. U is connected to both B and C. A is connected to B but not to C. So, A is not connected to C, so A is the town not connected to C. Therefore, edge BC is okay. Then, total edges: 5. Now, check all edges:- UA: C is not connected to A.- UB: C is not connected to B.- UC: A is not connected to C.- AB: C is not connected to A.- BC: A is not connected to C.Wait, so all edges satisfy the condition. Therefore, a graph with 5 edges on 4 nodes satisfies the condition. The total possible edges are 6. So, only one edge is missing: AC. So, in this case, the maximum is 5 edges. Therefore, my previous thought that 4 was the maximum was wrong.So, in the 4-node case, the maximum is 5 edges, missing only AC. Let&#39;s verify the condition for each edge:- UA: C is not connected to A. Okay.- UB: C is not connected to B. But in this graph, C is connected to B via BC. Wait, in the graph I described, edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, BC. So, BC is an edge. Therefore, for edge UB, we need a town not connected to U or B. U is connected to everyone, so the town must be not connected to B. The towns are A, C. A is connected to B, C is connected to B. Therefore, there is no town not connected to B. Therefore, edge UB violates the condition. Oops, my mistake.Therefore, adding edge BC causes a problem with edge UB. Therefore, that graph is invalid. So, in the 4-node case, the maximum number of edges is indeed 4. Let&#39;s try again.Edges: UA, UB, UC, AB. Non-edges: AC, BC, and the other non-edges are the ones not mentioned. For edge UA: C is not connected to A. For edge UB: C is not connected to B. For edge UC: A is not connected to C. For edge AB: C is not connected to A or B. So, this works. If we add edge AC, then we have edges UA, UB, UC, AB, AC. For edge AC, we need a town not connected to A or C. Towns are B, U. U is connected to both, B is connected to A but not to C. Therefore, B is not connected to C. Therefore, edge AC is okay. Then, check edge UB: need a town not connected to U or B. Since U is connected to everyone, need a town not connected to B. Towns are A, C. A is connected to B, C is connected to B (if we added BC). Wait, in this case, if we added AC but not BC, then edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, AC. Then, for edge UB: need a town not connected to B. Towns are A, C. A is connected to B, C is connected to B? No, C is connected to A and U, but not to B. Wait, in this graph, edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, AC. So, C is connected to U and A, but not to B. Therefore, for edge UB, town C is not connected to B. Therefore, that works. Similarly, edge BC is not present, so if we add BC, we have to check.Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the takeaway is that the 4-node graph can have 5 edges and satisfy the condition. Let me actually draw it out mentally.Vertices: U, A, B, C.Edges: UA, UB, UC, AB, AC, BC. Wait, no, that&#39;s the complete graph except for edge UC. Wait, no, if edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, AC, BC, that&#39;s all except maybe UA is already there. Wait, this is confusing.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is 5 edges. For example, if we have a universal vertex U connected to A, B, C. Then, A connected to B and C, and B connected to C. Then, edges: UA, UB, UC, AB, AC, BC. That&#39;s 6 edges, which is complete graph. But as before, it doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. Because for edge UA, there&#39;s no town not connected to A or U. Since U is connected to everyone, and A is connected to U, B, C. So, no town is not connected to A or U. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, have edges UA, UB, UC, AB, AC. So, missing BC. Then, for edge UA, town C is not connected to A? No, C is connected to A. Wait, edges UA, UB, UC, AB, AC. So, C is connected to U and A. For edge UA, need a town not connected to U or A. Since U is universal, town must be not connected to A. Towns connected to A are U, B. C is connected to A. Wait, Doh! In a 4-node graph, vertices are U, A, B, C. If edges are UA, UB, UC, AB, AC, then C is connected to U and A, but not to B. So, for edge UA, need a town not connected to U or A. U is connected to all, so must be a town not connected to A. That town is B? But B is connected to A. Wait, no. A is connected to U, B, and C. Therefore, all towns are connected to A except maybe none. Wait, no, in this graph, edges from A are UA, AB, AC. Therefore, A is connected to everyone. Therefore, for edge UA, need a town not connected to U or A. But everyone is connected to U or A. Therefore, edge UA violates the condition. Therefore, this graph is invalid.This is really tricky. Maybe I need to step back.The key idea in the problem is that for every edge, there is some vertex not connected to at least one of its endpoints. So, in other words, no edge is &quot;universal&quot; in the sense that both endpoints are connected to all other vertices. Therefore, to maximize the number of edges, we need to ensure that every edge has at least one endpoint that is not universal. The most efficient way to do this is to have a single universal vertex connected to all others, and then the remaining vertices form a graph where each has exactly one non-neighbor. This way, every edge not involving the universal vertex has an endpoint with a non-neighbor, and every edge involving the universal vertex has the other endpoint with a non-neighbor.But in the 4-node case, this approach gives 3 edges from the universal vertex plus 1 edge among the others (with two non-edges), totaling 4 edges, which seems to work. However, as seen earlier, there might be a way to have 5 edges, but perhaps my analysis was incorrect.But in the general case, with 100 nodes, having one universal vertex connected to 99 others, and the 99 others forming a graph with 50 non-edges (so 4851 - 50 = 4801 edges) plus the 99 edges from the universal vertex gives 4900 edges. This seems to satisfy the condition because every edge from the universal vertex has an endpoint (the non-universal vertex) with a non-neighbor, and every edge among the 99 non-universal vertices has at least one endpoint with a non-neighbor.Alternatively, if we partition the graph into two sets: a small set with k vertices and a large set with 100 - k vertices, making the small set a complete graph and connecting each vertex in the large set to all except one vertex in the small set. This might also satisfy the condition.Wait, let&#39;s explore this. Let’s say we partition the graph into two sets: S with k vertices and T with 100 - k vertices. Make S a complete graph. Each vertex in T is connected to all vertices in S except one. Assign each vertex in T to a unique vertex in S to avoid. This way, each vertex in T has degree k - 1 in S. Then, the total number of edges would be:- Edges within S: C(k, 2).- Edges from T to S: (100 - k)(k - 1).- Edges within T: Assuming we make T a complete graph as well, which would be C(100 - k, 2). But wait, if T is a complete graph, then for edges within T, we need to ensure that for each edge AB in T, there is a vertex C not connected to A or B. But if S is complete and each vertex in T is connected to all but one in S, then for any edge AB in T, the vertices in S are connected to both A and B, except possibly one vertex in S that A is not connected to and one vertex in S that B is not connected to. If those are different, then there exists a vertex in S not connected to A or B. Therefore, for edge AB in T, the town C can be the one in S not connected to A or B.Wait, let me clarify. Suppose each vertex in T is missing one connection in S. Let&#39;s say each vertex in T is connected to all but one distinct vertex in S. So, if |S| = k and |T| = 100 - k, then we need 100 - k ≤ k, so that each vertex in T can be assigned a unique vertex in S to avoid. Therefore, 100 - k ≤ k ⇒ k ≥ 50. So, let&#39;s take k=50. Then, S has 50 vertices, T has 50 vertices. Each vertex in T is connected to 49 vertices in S (missing one unique vertex). Then, edges within S: C(50,2) = 1225. Edges from T to S: 50*49 = 2450. Edges within T: If we make T a complete graph, that&#39;s C(50,2) = 1225. So, total edges: 1225 + 2450 + 1225 = 4900. Same as the previous construction.But does this graph satisfy the condition?For edges within S: Take an edge AB in S. Since S is a complete graph, we need a vertex C not connected to A or B. Since S is complete, all vertices in S are connected to A and B. The vertices in T are each connected to all but one vertex in S. Since each vertex in T is missing only one vertex in S, and since A and B are in S, there are vertices in T missing A or missing B. Specifically, the vertex in T assigned to avoid A is not connected to A, and the one assigned to avoid B is not connected to B. Therefore, for edge AB in S, we can take a vertex in T that is not connected to A (exists) or not connected to B (exists). Therefore, condition satisfied.For edges from S to T: Take an edge between a vertex A in S and a vertex X in T. X is connected to all vertices in S except one, say B. Therefore, for edge AX, we need a vertex C not connected to A or X. If we take B in S, which is connected to A (since S is complete) but not connected to X. Therefore, B is not connected to X, so B is a town not connected to X. Therefore, condition satisfied.For edges within T: Take an edge XY in T. Since T is a complete graph, but each vertex in T is missing one connection in S. Suppose X is not connected to A in S, and Y is not connected to B in S. If A ≠ B, then in S, A is connected to Y and B is connected to X. Therefore, A is connected to Y, B is connected to X. So, to find a vertex not connected to X or Y, we can take a vertex in S that is not connected to X or Y. However, since X is only not connected to A, and Y is only not connected to B, if A ≠ B, then there is no vertex in S not connected to X or Y. Because all vertices in S except A are connected to X, and all vertices in S except B are connected to Y. So, if A ≠ B, then all vertices in S are connected to X or Y except A and B. But A is connected to Y (since Y is connected to all S except B), and B is connected to X (since X is connected to all S except A). Therefore, all vertices in S are connected to at least one of X or Y. Therefore, we need to find a vertex not connected to X or Y outside of S. But T is a complete graph, so all vertices in T are connected to X and Y. Therefore, there is no vertex not connected to X or Y. Therefore, edge XY in T violates the condition. Therefore, this construction is invalid.Ah, there&#39;s the problem. If T is a complete graph, then edges within T do not satisfy the condition. Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, the only way this construction works is if T is not a complete graph. If we leave T with no edges, then the total edges would be 1225 + 2450 = 3675, which is much less than 4900. Therefore, the previous construction with a universal vertex and the remaining 99 vertices missing one edge each is better.Alternatively, if we don&#39;t make T a complete graph but instead ensure that for every edge in T, there is a vertex not connected to one endpoint. But this brings us back to the initial problem of constructing such a graph.Therefore, the best construction so far is the one with a universal vertex and the other 99 vertices forming a graph where each has exactly one non-neighbor, requiring 50 non-edges, resulting in 4900 total edges. This seems to satisfy the condition because:- For any edge involving the universal vertex, the non-universal endpoint has a non-neighbor among the other 99 vertices.- For any edge among the 99 vertices, each endpoint has a non-neighbor (the one they are missing), so at least one of those non-neighbors can serve as the town not connected to one endpoint.Therefore, this construction works, and results in 4900 edges. The question is, can we do better?Suppose instead of one universal vertex, we have multiple &quot;almost universal&quot; vertices, each missing a few connections. However, coordinating their non-neighbors to satisfy the condition might be complex.Alternatively, consider a graph composed of a clique and an independent set. Let’s say we have a clique of size k and an independent set of size 100 - k. Each vertex in the independent set is connected to all vertices in the clique. Then, the total number of edges is C(k,2) + k*(100 - k). For each edge within the clique, we need a vertex not connected to at least one endpoint. The independent set vertices are connected to both endpoints, so the non-connected vertex must be in the independent set. But since the independent set is independent, they are not connected to anyone in the independent set, but they are connected to the clique. Therefore, for an edge AB in the clique, any vertex in the independent set is connected to both A and B. Therefore, there is no vertex not connected to A or B, so this construction doesn&#39;t work.Alternatively, if the independent set is not connected to the clique. Then, for edges within the clique, the non-connected vertices can be in the independent set. For example, if we have a clique of size k and an independent set of size 100 - k, with no edges between them. Then, edges within the clique: C(k,2). For any edge AB in the clique, the independent set vertices are not connected to A or B, satisfying the condition. For edges within the independent set, there are none. Therefore, this graph satisfies the condition. The number of edges is C(k,2). To maximize this, we take k as large as possible. The maximum C(k,2) is C(100,2) = 4950, but that&#39;s the complete graph, which we know doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. If we have a clique of size 99 and an independent set of size 1, then the number of edges is C(99,2) = 4851. But in this case, for any edge in the clique, the independent set vertex is not connected to either endpoint, so it&#39;s okay. But then the total edges are 4851, which is less than 4900. Therefore, the previous construction with a universal vertex is better.Another approach: maybe the graph is a complete graph minus a matching. If we remove a matching of size m from the complete graph, then the number of edges is C(100,2) - m. For each edge in the graph, we need a vertex not connected to at least one endpoint. If an edge is part of the matching, then it&#39;s removed, so it&#39;s not in the graph. For the remaining edges, if they are not in the matching, we need to check. Suppose we remove a matching of size 50, so 100 vertices, so 50 edges removed. Then, the number of edges is 4950 - 50 = 4900. Now, check if this graph satisfies the condition.Take any edge AB in the graph. If AB is not in the matching, then AB is present. We need a vertex C not connected to A or B. Since we only removed a matching, the only non-edges are the 50 disjoint edges. So, if neither A nor B is involved in any non-edge, then they are connected to everyone else. Wait, no. If AB is not in the matching, then A and B are still connected to all others except their respective matched partners. For example, if A is matched with C (an edge AC removed), and B is matched with D (edge BD removed), then A is not connected to C, and B is not connected to D. Therefore, for edge AB, the vertex C is not connected to A, and vertex D is not connected to B. Therefore, either C or D can serve as the town not connected to A or B. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.For edges that are part of the matching, they are removed, so they are not in the graph. Therefore, this graph, which is a complete graph minus a matching of size 50, has 4900 edges and satisfies the condition. This is another construction achieving 4900 edges.But wait, does this work? Let&#39;s take a small example. Suppose we have 4 vertices: A, B, C, D. Remove a matching of two edges: AB and CD. The remaining edges are AC, AD, BC, BD. So, total edges: 4. Check the condition for each edge:- AC: For edge AC, need a town not connected to A or C. Towns are B, D. B is connected to A (no, B is connected to C and D). Wait, in the remaining graph:After removing AB and CD, the edges are AC, AD, BC, BD. So:- A is connected to C, D.- B is connected to C, D.- C is connected to A, B.- D is connected to A, B.For edge AC: Need a town not connected to A or C. Towns are B, D. B is connected to C, D is connected to A. Therefore, no town is not connected to A or C. Therefore, edge AC violates the condition. Therefore, this construction doesn&#39;t work in the 4-node case.Ah, so the complete graph minus a matching doesn&#39;t necessarily satisfy the condition. Therefore, the earlier reasoning was flawed. Therefore, the two constructions (universal vertex + 99 others with 50 non-edges, and complete graph minus a matching) are different, and the former works while the latter doesn&#39;t necessarily.Therefore, the correct construction is the one with a universal vertex and the other 99 vertices forming a graph with 50 non-edges. This seems to yield 4900 edges, and satisfies the condition.But now, let me consider another angle. The problem states that for every edge AB, there exists a town C not connected to at least one of A or B. This resembles the condition that the graph is not a cluster where every edge is part of a &quot;universal&quot; connection. In graph theory terms, this condition prevents the graph from having edges whose endpoints form a &quot;total dominating set&quot;. But I might be off here.Alternatively, think of the problem as a graph without edges whose endpoints have a closed neighborhood covering the entire vertex set. So, for every edge AB, the union of N(A) and N(B) does not equal V  {A,B}. This is equivalent to saying that there is no edge AB such that A and B are connected to all other vertices. Therefore, such a graph cannot have two universal vertices, as previously established.Therefore, the maximum number of edges would be achieved by a graph with one universal vertex and the remaining vertices missing as few edges as possible, while ensuring that every edge has the required property. As we saw, this leads to 4900 edges.Alternatively, perhaps there is a more efficient construction. Let&#39;s think about Turán&#39;s theorem. Turán&#39;s theorem gives the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain complete subgraphs of a certain size. However, our condition is different; we are not forbidding any complete subgraphs, but rather imposing a condition on each edge. However, maybe Turán&#39;s theorem can inspire some construction.Turán&#39;s theorem for triangle-free graphs gives that the maximum number of edges is floor(n²/4). For n=100, that&#39;s 2500 edges. But in our problem, we can have more edges, as we&#39;ve already constructed 4900, which is much higher.Alternatively, maybe the graph is a split graph, which is a graph that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The split graph with the maximum number of edges is when the clique is as large as possible. However, as previously discussed, the split graph with a large clique and small independent set may not satisfy the condition because edges within the clique need vertices not connected to their endpoints, which must come from the independent set, but if the independent set is too small, there may not be enough such vertices.But in our previous construction with one universal vertex and the rest forming a graph with 50 non-edges, it&#39;s essentially a split graph where the clique is the universal vertex plus the 99 others forming a near-complete graph. However, the 99 others don&#39;t form a clique but a near-complete graph missing 50 edges.Wait, but split graphs are characterized by being a clique plus an independent set. In our case, the 99 vertices are not an independent set, but a graph with 50 non-edges. Therefore, it&#39;s not a split graph.Alternatively, if we consider the graph as a complete graph missing 50 edges, where the missing edges form a matching, but as we saw in the 4-node example, that might not work. However, in the universal vertex construction, the missing edges are arranged such that each missing edge is incident to a different vertex.But in the universal vertex case, the missing edges are among the 99 vertices, each missing one edge. Since 99 is odd, we can&#39;t have a perfect matching; hence, at least one vertex must miss two edges. But earlier, I thought we need at least 50 non-edges. Wait, perhaps not.Wait, if we have 99 vertices, each needs to miss at least one edge. If each non-edge can cover two vertices, then the minimal number of non-edges required is ceil(99/2) = 50. Therefore, 50 non-edges. So, in the universal vertex construction, the 99 vertices form a graph missing 50 edges, each non-edge removing one connection from two vertices. Therefore, allowing each vertex to miss exactly one edge if 99 is even, or 49 vertices missing one edge and one vertex missing two edges if 99 is odd. But 99 is odd, so we need 50 non-edges. Therefore, one vertex will miss two edges, and the rest will miss one each. However, this causes a problem because the vertex missing two edges will have two non-neighbors. Then, for edges connected to that vertex, we need a town not connected to it, which exists. But for edges between two vertices each missing one edge, their non-neighbors can serve as the required town.Therefore, even with one vertex missing two edges, the construction still works. Therefore, the total number of edges is 99 (from the universal vertex) + (C(99,2) - 50) = 99 + 4851 - 50 = 99 + 4801 = 4900.Therefore, this construction is valid and results in 4900 edges. Is this the maximum possible?Suppose we try to have more edges. For example, 4901 edges. That would mean the graph is missing 49 edges. If we try to remove only 49 edges from the complete graph, then among the 99 vertices, we have 49 non-edges. Since each of the 99 vertices needs to miss at least one edge, 49 non-edges can only cover 98 vertices, leaving one vertex with all edges present. That vertex is connected to all other 98 vertices. Therefore, consider an edge between this vertex and the universal vertex. For this edge, we need a town not connected to at least one endpoint. The universal vertex is connected to everyone, so the town must be not connected to the other vertex. But this other vertex is connected to all except the 49 non-edges. Wait, no. If we have 49 non-edges among the 99 vertices, then one vertex is connected to all others, and 98 vertices each miss one edge. Therefore, the vertex connected to all others (let&#39;s call it V) has edges to all other 98 vertices. Then, the edge between the universal vertex U and V would require a town not connected to V. But V is connected to everyone except U (wait, no. V is in the 99 vertices, so U is connected to V. V is connected to all other 98 vertices in the 99. Therefore, V is connected to U and all other 98. Therefore, there is no town not connected to V. Therefore, the edge UV violates the condition. Therefore, this construction is invalid.Therefore, removing only 49 edges is not possible, as it leaves a vertex connected to all others, creating a problem with the edge to the universal vertex. Therefore, we need to remove at least 50 edges, leading back to the 4900 edge construction.Therefore, 4900 edges seems to be the maximum.But to confirm, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s a different graph structure that allows more edges while satisfying the condition.Suppose we have a graph with two universal vertices U and V. But as previously established, the edge between U and V would require a town not connected to U or V, which doesn&#39;t exist since they are universal. Therefore, invalid.Alternatively, three cliques interconnected in some way. But this is vague.Alternatively, maybe a graph with high minimum degree. Let&#39;s think about the degree sequence. For the graph to have as many edges as possible, each vertex should have as high a degree as possible. However, the condition imposes that for every edge AB, there is a vertex not connected to A or B. Therefore, if two vertices have very high degrees, their common neighborhood might be too large, potentially violating the condition.In the universal vertex construction, the universal vertex has degree 99, and the others have degree 98 (each missing one edge). Therefore, the common neighborhood of any two non-universal vertices A and B is all the other 98 vertices except their one non-neighbor each. If A and B are missing different non-neighbors, then their common neighborhood is 97 vertices. Therefore, there exist vertices not connected to A or B (specifically, the non-neighbors of A and B). Therefore, for edge AB, those non-neighbors can serve as C.If A and B are missing the same non-neighbor, then their common neighborhood is 98 vertices, missing only that one. Therefore, the non-neighbor is not connected to both A and B, so it can serve as C for edge AB.Therefore, in any case, the construction works.Therefore, after careful analysis, the maximum number of edges is 4900, achieved by a graph with one universal vertex and the remaining 99 vertices forming a graph with 50 non-edges (each vertex missing at least one edge).Therefore, the answer should be boxed{4900}.Final Answerboxed{4900}&lt;/think&gt;Given a problem where we need to determine the maximum number of roads (edges) in a graph of 100 towns (vertices) such that for any two connected towns (A) and (B), there exists a town (C) not connected to at least one of (A) or (B), we can reason as follows:1. Key Insight: For every edge (AB), there must be a vertex (C) such that (C) is not adjacent to (A) or (B). This means the union of the neighborhoods of (A) and (B) does not cover all vertices except (A) and (B).2. Universal Vertex Construction: Consider a graph with one universal vertex (U) connected to all other 99 vertices. The remaining 99 vertices form a subgraph where each vertex has exactly one non-neighbor. This ensures that for any edge involving (U), the non-universal vertex has a non-neighbor, and for any edge among the remaining 99 vertices, each endpoint has a non-neighbor.3. Non-Edges Calculation: For the 99 vertices, each vertex must have at least one non-neighbor. The minimum number of non-edges required is (lceil frac{99}{2} rceil = 50), as each non-edge can account for two vertices.4. Edge Count:   - The universal vertex (U) contributes 99 edges.   - The remaining 99 vertices form a graph with (binom{99}{2} - 50) edges.   - Total edges: (99 + left( frac{99 cdot 98}{2} - 50 right) = 99 + 4801 = 4900).5. Verification: This construction satisfies the given condition because every edge involving (U) has a non-neighbor in the remaining vertices, and every edge among the remaining vertices has a non-neighbor due to the 50 missing edges.Thus, the maximum number of roads is (boxed{4900}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here where there are 100 towns in a kingdom, and some of them are connected by roads. The condition is that for any two towns A and B that are connected by a road, there must exist another town C that isn&#39;t connected by a road to at least one of A or B. The question is asking for the maximum number of roads possible under this condition. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to wrap my head around this.First, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it. We have a graph with 100 vertices (towns), and edges (roads) between some of them. The condition is that for every edge AB, there exists a vertex C such that either AC or BC is not an edge. So, for every edge, there&#39;s a vertex that is not adjacent to at least one endpoint of that edge. The goal is to find the maximum number of edges such that this condition holds for every edge.Okay, so in graph theory terms, we need a graph where every edge has a &quot;witness&quot; vertex that is not connected to at least one of its endpoints. I need to maximize the number of edges in such a graph. Hmm. Let&#39;s think about how such a graph can be structured.Maybe it&#39;s helpful to consider smaller cases first. Let&#39;s take a simple example with fewer towns and see how the condition applies. Suppose there are 3 towns. If we have all three roads (forming a triangle), then for each edge, we need a town C not connected to at least one of A or B. But in a triangle, every town is connected to every other town, so there is no such town C. Therefore, a complete graph on 3 vertices doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. So, the maximum number of edges must be less than 3 here. If we have two edges, forming a path, then each edge does have a witness. For the first edge, the third town is not connected to one endpoint, and similarly for the second edge. So, two edges work. Is two the maximum? Yes, because three edges violate the condition. So for n=3, the maximum is 2.Similarly, let&#39;s check n=4. A complete graph would have 6 edges, but again, every edge would have no witness, because all towns are connected. So, complete graph is out. What&#39;s the next best? Maybe a complete bipartite graph. Let&#39;s see. If we split the 4 towns into two equal partitions, say two and two. Then the complete bipartite graph K_{2,2} has 4 edges. Each edge connects a vertex from partition A to partition B. For any edge AB (where A is in partition 1 and B is in partition 2), there exists a vertex C in partition 1 (not connected to B) and a vertex D in partition 2 (not connected to A). So, each edge has multiple witnesses. So K_{2,2} satisfies the condition and has 4 edges. Is that the maximum? Let&#39;s see if we can add a fifth edge. If we add another edge, say between two vertices in partition 1, then we have two edges within partition 1. Now, take one of the original edges between partition 1 and 2. For that edge, the other vertex in partition 1 is connected to both endpoints? Wait, if we added an edge within partition 1, then the vertices in partition 1 are now connected. Let me check. Suppose the partitions are {A,B} and {C,D}. Original edges are AC, AD, BC, BD. If we add AB, then consider edge AC. For edge AC, we need a town not connected to A or C. C is connected to A, but B is connected to A (since we added AB) and B is connected to C and D. Wait, no, B is in partition 1, so originally connected to C and D. If we added AB, then B is connected to A. So, for edge AC, the town B is connected to A but not to C? Wait, no, B is connected to C through the original edge BC. So, for edge AC, any other town: B is connected to both A and C, D is connected to A (through AD) and C (through CD if CD exists). Wait, but in K_{2,2}, there&#39;s no CD. CD is not an edge. So, in K_{2,2}, the edges are only between partitions. So, if we add AB to K_{2,2}, making it no longer bipartite, then for edge AC, the town D is connected to A (AD) but is D connected to C? In original K_{2,2}, yes, D is connected to C? Wait, no, in K_{2,2}, each vertex in partition 1 is connected to each in partition 2. So, D is in partition 2, so connected to A and B. C is in partition 2, connected to A and B. Wait, no, if the partitions are {A,B} and {C,D}, then C is connected to A and B, D is connected to A and B. So CD is not an edge. So in the original K_{2,2}, CD is not an edge. So, for edge AC, town D is connected to A (AD) but not connected to C (since CD is not an edge). Therefore, D is a witness for edge AC because D is not connected to C. Similarly, for edge AB (which we added), we need a town not connected to A or B. But since we added AB, A and B are connected. All other towns are C and D, which are connected to both A and B. So, in this case, there is no witness for edge AB. Therefore, adding AB violates the condition. So, K_{2,2} plus AB is invalid. Therefore, we can&#39;t add AB. Alternatively, if we add CD instead, same problem. So, maybe the maximum is indeed 4 for n=4.Alternatively, maybe a different graph structure? For example, a cycle of 4. Each town is connected to two others. For each edge, the witness could be the town opposite? Wait, in a cycle of 4 (a square), each edge connects two adjacent towns. For edge AB, the opposite town is D. Is D connected to A or B? In a cycle, D is connected to C and A. Wait, if it&#39;s a square: A connected to B and D, B connected to A and C, C connected to B and D, D connected to C and A. So for edge AB, the town C is connected to B but not to A? Wait, no, C is connected to B and D. So C is connected to B. Town D is connected to A and C. So for edge AB, neither C nor D is disconnected from both A and B. Wait, C is connected to B, D is connected to A. So, there is no town that is disconnected from both A and B. But the condition is that there exists a town disconnected from at least one of A or B. So, for edge AB, C is connected to B, so it&#39;s connected to at least one of A or B. D is connected to A, so same thing. So, there is no town that&#39;s disconnected from both. However, the condition is just that there exists a town disconnected from at least one. Wait, no, the problem states: &quot;a town C which is not connected by a road with at least one of the towns A and B&quot;. So, C is not connected to A or not connected to B. So, in the cycle of 4, for edge AB, town C is connected to B, town D is connected to A. So, there is no town that is disconnected from both, but there are towns disconnected from one. Wait, but the problem only requires that there exists a town disconnected from at least one. So, for edge AB, town C is connected to B but not to A? Wait, in the cycle, town C is connected to B and D. So, C is connected to B, which is one endpoint. Similarly, town D is connected to A. So, for edge AB, towns C and D are each connected to one of A or B. But is there a town not connected to at least one? Town C is connected to B, so it is connected to at least one. Similarly, D is connected to A. So, actually, all towns are connected to at least one of A or B. Therefore, in a 4-cycle, for edge AB, there is no town that is disconnected from both A and B, but the problem allows a town disconnected from at least one. Wait, but all towns are connected to at least one. So, in the 4-cycle, there is no town that is disconnected from both, but the problem requires a town disconnected from at least one. Wait, but if a town is connected to at least one, then it&#39;s not disconnected from both. Wait, maybe the problem is misinterpreted. Let me check again.Original problem: &quot;for each two towns A and B connected by a road there is a town C which is not connected by a road with at least one of the towns A and B&quot;. So, for edge AB, there must be a town C such that either C is not connected to A, or C is not connected to B. So, such a C exists. In the 4-cycle, take edge AB. Then, town C is connected to B and D. So, C is connected to B. Town D is connected to A. So, town C is connected to B, town D is connected to A. So, is there a town not connected to A or B? Town C is connected to B, town D is connected to A, towns A and B are connected to each other. So, all towns are connected to at least one of A or B. Therefore, in the 4-cycle, for edge AB, there is no town C that is not connected to at least one of A or B. Therefore, the 4-cycle does not satisfy the condition. So, the 4-cycle is invalid. Therefore, the complete bipartite graph K_{2,2} is better because for each edge, there is a town not connected to one endpoint.Wait, in K_{2,2}, take edge AC. Then, town B is connected to C, but town D is not connected to A. Wait, no, in K_{2,2}, town D is connected to A. Wait, no, let&#39;s clarify. If partitions are {A,B} and {C,D}, then edges are AC, AD, BC, BD. So, for edge AC, the other towns are B, D. Town B is connected to C (through BC) and town D is connected to A (through AD). So, both B and D are connected to at least one of A or C. But wait, town D is connected to A, so not disconnected from A. Town B is connected to C. So, for edge AC, is there a town not connected to A or C? Town B is connected to C, town D is connected to A. So, again, similar to the cycle, all towns are connected to at least one endpoint. Wait, but this contradicts my earlier thought. So, maybe K_{2,2} also doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition? But wait, no, in K_{2,2}, for edge AC, town B is in partition {A,B}, which is connected to C and D. Wait, town B is connected to C and D. So, town B is connected to C, which is one endpoint. Town D is connected to A. So, again, all towns are connected to at least one of A or C. Therefore, there is no town that is not connected to at least one of A or C. Therefore, K_{2,2} also doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. Wait, that&#39;s confusing.But hold on, the problem states that for each edge AB, there exists a town C not connected to at least one of A or B. In K_{2,2}, take edge AC. The towns are A, B, C, D. Town B is connected to C, D. Town D is connected to A, B. So, town B is connected to C (the other endpoint). Town D is connected to A (the other endpoint). So, both B and D are connected to at least one of A or C. So, there is no town not connected to at least one. Therefore, K_{2,2} does not satisfy the condition either. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. Then, how did I think earlier that K_{2,2} satisfied the condition?Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If we have partitions {A,B} and {C,D}, edges are AC, AD, BC, BD. For edge AC, the other towns are B and D. Town B is connected to C (BC) and D (BD). Town D is connected to A (AD) and B (BD). So, town B is connected to C, town D is connected to A. So, both are connected to at least one of the endpoints. Therefore, no town is disconnected from both A and C. However, the problem requires a town disconnected from at least one, not necessarily both. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.The problem says: &quot;a town C which is not connected by a road with at least one of the towns A and B&quot;. So, C is not connected to A or not connected to B. So, for edge AC, we need a town that is not connected to A or not connected to C. Let&#39;s see: town B is connected to C (through BC) but is town B connected to A? In K_{2,2}, no. Town B is in partition {A,B}, so connected to C and D. Wait, no, in K_{2,2}, each vertex in partition 1 is connected to all in partition 2. So, town B is connected to C and D, but not to A. Wait, no. Wait, partition 1 is {A,B}, partition 2 is {C,D}. So, A is connected to C and D; B is connected to C and D. So, towns A and B are not connected to each other. So, in K_{2,2}, edge AC: towns are A, B, C, D. For edge AC, we need a town not connected to A or not connected to C. Town B is not connected to A (since in partition 1, they are not connected), but is connected to C. So, town B is not connected to A, so it&#39;s a witness. Similarly, town D is connected to A (AD) and connected to C (since in partition 2, but wait, in partition 2, {C,D} are not connected between themselves? Wait, no, in a complete bipartite graph, edges are only between partitions, not within. So, in K_{2,2}, C and D are not connected. So, town D is connected to A and B, but not to C. Wait, no. In K_{2,2}, town D is in partition 2, so connected to all in partition 1, which are A and B. Therefore, D is connected to A and B, but not to C. Wait, partition 2 is {C,D}, so C and D are in the same partition and hence not connected. So, for edge AC, town D is connected to A (AD) but not connected to C (since CD is not an edge). Therefore, town D is a witness because it&#39;s not connected to C. Similarly, town B is not connected to A. So, either town B or town D can serve as the witness for edge AC. So, in this case, K_{2,2} does satisfy the condition. My mistake earlier was thinking that D is connected to C, but in fact, in the complete bipartite graph, there are no edges within partitions. So, CD is not an edge. Therefore, town D is not connected to C, hence is a valid witness for edge AC. Similarly, town B is not connected to A, so is also a witness. Therefore, K_{2,2} does satisfy the condition, and each edge has multiple witnesses. Therefore, K_{2,2} is a valid graph with 4 edges for n=4. If we try to add another edge, say AC, but it&#39;s already there. Wait, adding an edge within a partition, say AB, then for edge AB, we need a witness town not connected to A or B. But in K_{2,2} plus AB, all other towns (C and D) are connected to both A and B. So, no witness exists, which violates the condition. Therefore, the maximum is indeed 4 for n=4.So, from these small cases, it seems that complete bipartite graphs might be good candidates because they naturally have vertices in one partition not connected to those in the other, which can serve as witnesses. Let&#39;s consider that.In a complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}, the graph is divided into two partitions with m and n vertices, and every vertex in one partition is connected to every vertex in the other partition, with no edges within a partition. For any edge between partitions, the witness can be a vertex in the same partition as one endpoint (since those aren&#39;t connected to the other endpoint). For example, take an edge AB where A is in partition 1 and B is in partition 2. Then, any other vertex in partition 1 is not connected to B, so can serve as a witness. Similarly, any vertex in partition 2 is not connected to A. Therefore, every edge in K_{m,n} satisfies the condition. So, complete bipartite graphs satisfy the condition. Therefore, if we model our graph as a complete bipartite graph, we can have a large number of edges while satisfying the condition. The question is, is the complete bipartite graph the maximum possible?In the case of n=100 towns, what&#39;s the maximum number of edges in a complete bipartite graph? It is achieved when the partitions are as equal as possible. For even n, split into two equal partitions of 50 each, giving 50*50=2500 edges. For odd n, it&#39;s floor(n/2)*ceil(n/2). Since 100 is even, it&#39;s 50*50=2500. So, 2500 edges.But is this the maximum possible? Or can we have a graph that is not bipartite but has more edges while still satisfying the condition?Alternatively, maybe a complete tripartite graph? Let&#39;s see. If we split the graph into three partitions, then edges exist between different partitions. For an edge between partition 1 and 2, a witness could be a vertex in partition 3. However, in a complete tripartite graph, a vertex in partition 3 is connected to all vertices in partitions 1 and 2. Wait, no. In a complete tripartite graph, each vertex is connected to all vertices not in its own partition. So, if we have three partitions, a vertex in partition 1 is connected to all in partitions 2 and 3. Therefore, for an edge between partition 1 and 2, a witness would need to be a vertex not connected to at least one of the endpoints. But any vertex in partition 3 is connected to both partitions 1 and 2, so connected to both endpoints. Therefore, in a complete tripartite graph, there are no witnesses for edges between different partitions, because all other vertices are connected to both endpoints. Therefore, complete tripartite graphs do not satisfy the condition. So, that&#39;s worse.Alternatively, maybe a graph that is a combination of complete bipartite and some other edges. But adding edges within a partition would create edges that might not have witnesses. For example, if we take K_{50,50} and add a few edges within a partition, then those new edges would need witnesses. But any witness would have to be a town not connected to at least one endpoint of the new edge. However, in the original partitions, all towns in the other partition are connected to both endpoints (since it&#39;s complete bipartite). And towns within the same partition are not connected to each other. So, for an edge within partition 1, say AB, the witness would need to be a town not connected to A or B. Towns in partition 2 are connected to both A and B, so they can&#39;t be witnesses. Towns within partition 1, other than A and B, are not connected to A or B (since there are no edges within the partition). So, town C in partition 1 is not connected to A or B, so can serve as a witness. Therefore, if we add an edge within partition 1, we can have a witness within the same partition. Therefore, maybe we can add some edges within a partition as long as for each such edge, there exists another vertex in the same partition not connected to its endpoints.Wait, but in that case, the graph becomes a combination of a complete bipartite graph and another graph within a partition. If the partition has m vertices, then the internal graph must satisfy that every edge has a witness within the partition. But since within the partition, originally there are no edges, adding edges would require that for each edge, there is a vertex not connected to at least one endpoint. If the internal graph is such that it&#39;s sparse enough so that for every edge, there is a non-adjacent vertex. For example, if we have a matching within the partition, then each edge has many witnesses. But if we have a complete graph within the partition, then obviously no witnesses. So, maybe if we add a triangle within the partition, then each edge in the triangle would need a witness, but all other vertices in the partition are connected or not? Wait, this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is indeed the complete bipartite graph, because any additional edges within a partition would require the partition to be sparse enough to satisfy the witness condition, which might limit the number of edges we can add. So, maybe the complete bipartite graph is the optimal.But let&#39;s test this with another example. Suppose n=5. If we split into partitions of 2 and 3. Then K_{2,3} has 6 edges. For each edge between partitions, the witness can be a vertex in the same partition as one endpoint. For example, edge AB (A in partition 1, B in partition 2). In partition 1, there&#39;s another vertex C (if partition 1 has 2 vertices). Wait, partition 1 has 2, partition 2 has 3. So, edge AB: witness could be the other vertex in partition 1, say C, which is not connected to B. Similarly, for edges in partition 2, there are none. So, K_{2,3} is okay. If we try to add an edge within partition 1 (which has 2 vertices), making it a complete graph within partition 1. Then, the edge AC (assuming partition 1 is {A,C}) now exists. For this edge, we need a witness not connected to A or C. All vertices in partition 2 are connected to both A and C, so they can&#39;t be witnesses. The other vertices in partition 1 are only B? Wait, no, partition 1 has only A and C. So, there&#39;s no other vertex in partition 1. So, there is no witness for edge AC. Therefore, we can&#39;t add that edge. So, partitions of 2 and 3 can have 6 edges. Alternatively, if we make a different split, say 3 and 2, same result. If we make a split of 1 and 4, K_{1,4} has 4 edges. That&#39;s worse. So, maximum is 6. But if we consider another graph structure. For example, a cycle of 5. Each edge in the cycle would need a witness. For any edge AB in the cycle, the town C which is two steps away would be connected to B but not to A? Wait, in a 5-cycle, each town is connected to two others. For edge AB, the other towns are C, D, E. Town C is connected to B and D, town D is connected to C and E, town E is connected to D and A. So, for edge AB, town E is connected to A and D. Town D is connected to C and E. Town C is connected to B and D. So, town C is connected to B, town D is connected to E, town E is connected to A. So, there is no town that is not connected to at least one of A or B. Wait, town D is connected to E and C, which are not A or B. So, town D is not connected to A or B. Wait, in a 5-cycle, town D is not connected to A or B? Wait, in a 5-cycle, towns are connected in a ring. Let&#39;s label them A, B, C, D, E. So, edges are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA. So, for edge AB, the towns are C, D, E. Town C is connected to B, town D is connected to C and E, town E is connected to D and A. So, town D is not connected to A or B. So, town D is not connected to A or B. Therefore, town D is a witness for edge AB. Similarly, for edge BC, town E is not connected to B or C. Wait, town E is connected to A and D. So, town E is not connected to B or C. Therefore, town E is a witness. Similarly, for edge CD, town A is not connected to C or D. Town A is connected to B and E. So, town A is a witness. For edge DE, town B is not connected to D or E. Town B is connected to A and C. So, town B is a witness. For edge EA, town C is not connected to E or A. Town C is connected to B and D. So, town C is a witness. Therefore, in a 5-cycle, every edge has a witness. Therefore, the 5-cycle satisfies the condition and has 5 edges. But K_{2,3} has 6 edges. So, K_{2,3} is better. Therefore, complete bipartite graphs can give more edges than cycles. So, maybe complete bipartite is better.Therefore, returning to the original problem with 100 towns. If we split into two partitions as equally as possible, 50 and 50, then the number of edges is 50*50=2500. Each edge has witnesses in the form of vertices in the same partition as one endpoint, which are not connected to the other endpoint. For example, edge between partition1 and partition2, a witness can be any vertex in partition1 not connected to the partition2 endpoint (but wait, in complete bipartite, partition1 is connected to all in partition2). Wait, actually, in complete bipartite graph, any vertex in partition1 is connected to all in partition2. So, if we take an edge AB where A is in partition1 and B is in partition2. Then, any other vertex in partition1 is connected to B (since it&#39;s complete), and any other vertex in partition2 is connected to A. Therefore, the only vertices not connected to A are those in partition1, but they are connected to B. The only vertices not connected to B are in partition2, but they are connected to A. Wait, hold on. This seems contradictory to my earlier conclusion. Wait, in K_{m,n}, for edge AB (A in partition1, B in partition2), any other vertex C in partition1 is connected to B (since it&#39;s complete bipartite), so C is connected to B. Any vertex D in partition2 is connected to A. Therefore, there is no vertex that is not connected to at least one of A or B. Wait, that can&#39;t be. Then how come in K_{2,2}, we had witnesses?Wait, in K_{2,2} with partitions {A,B} and {C,D}. Take edge AC. The other vertices are B and D. Vertex B is in partition1, so connected to C and D. So, B is connected to C. Vertex D is in partition2, connected to A and B. So, D is connected to A. Therefore, both B and D are connected to at least one of A or C. Therefore, there is no vertex that is not connected to at least one of A or C. But earlier, I thought that in K_{2,2}, D is not connected to C. Wait, in K_{2,2}, D is in partition2, so connected to all in partition1, which are A and B. So, D is connected to A and B, but not to C. Wait, no, partition2 is {C,D}, so in complete bipartite, D is connected to A and B, but not to C. Similarly, C is connected to A and B, but not to D. Therefore, for edge AC, town D is not connected to C. Therefore, town D is a witness because it&#39;s not connected to C. Similarly, town B is not connected to A. Wait, no, town B is in partition1, so connected to C and D, but not to A? Wait, in K_{2,2}, vertices in partition1 are connected to all in partition2. So, partition1 is {A,B}, so A is connected to C and D; B is connected to C and D. So, A and B are not connected to each other. Therefore, in edge AC, town B is not connected to A (since there is no edge between A and B), but is connected to C. Therefore, town B is a witness because it&#39;s not connected to A. Similarly, town D is not connected to C, so is a witness. Therefore, there are two witnesses for edge AC: B and D. Similarly, for any edge in K_{m,n}, a witness can be found in the same partition as one endpoint, which is not connected to the other endpoint. Wait, let&#39;s clarify.Take a general edge in K_{m,n} between partition1 (size m) and partition2 (size n). Let the edge be between vertex A (partition1) and vertex B (partition2). Then, any other vertex in partition1 is not connected to B (wait, no, in complete bipartite, all vertices in partition1 are connected to all in partition2). Wait, no. Wait, no, vertices in partition1 are connected to all in partition2. Therefore, any vertex in partition1 is connected to B. Similarly, any vertex in partition2 is connected to A. Therefore, the only vertices not connected to A are those in partition1 (but they are all connected to B), and the only vertices not connected to B are those in partition2 (but they are all connected to A). Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, in K_{m,n}, vertices within partition1 are not connected to each other, and vertices within partition2 are not connected to each other. So, take edge AB again. Any vertex C in partition1 (other than A) is connected to B (since C is in partition1, connected to all in partition2). Similarly, any vertex D in partition2 (other than B) is connected to A. Therefore, for edge AB, all other vertices are connected to at least A or B. Therefore, there is no witness. Wait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion with K_{2,2}. What&#39;s the issue here?Wait, in K_{2,2}, edge AC: towns are A (partition1), B (partition1), C (partition2), D (partition2). For edge AC, the other towns are B and D. Town B is in partition1, connected to C and D (all in partition2). So, B is connected to C. Town D is in partition2, connected to A and B. So, D is connected to A. But in partition1, A and B are not connected. Wait, partition1 is {A,B}, no edges between them. So, town B is not connected to A. Therefore, for edge AC, town B is not connected to A, even though it&#39;s connected to C. So, town B is a witness because it&#39;s not connected to A. Similarly, town D is connected to A but not to C (since D is in partition2, connected to A and B, but partition2 has no internal edges, so D is not connected to C). Therefore, town D is a witness because it&#39;s not connected to C. Therefore, both B and D are witnesses for edge AC. So, in K_{m,n}, even though vertices in the same partition are not connected, when considering an edge between partitions, the other vertices in the same partition as one endpoint are not connected to the other endpoint? Wait, no. Wait, if you have edge AC in K_{2,2}, town B is in the same partition as A (partition1). Town B is connected to C (because in complete bipartite, partition1 is connected to partition2). Therefore, town B is connected to C, which is one endpoint. But town B is not connected to A, which is the other endpoint. Wait, no, town B is in partition1, so it&#39;s not connected to A (since there are no edges within partition1). Wait, partition1 has no internal edges, so A and B are not connected. Therefore, town B is not connected to A but is connected to C. Therefore, town B is not connected to A, so serves as a witness. Similarly, town D is in partition2, not connected to C (since partition2 has no internal edges), but is connected to A. Therefore, town D is not connected to C, so serves as a witness. Therefore, in K_{m,n}, for any edge between partitions, the other vertices in the same partition as one endpoint are not connected to the other endpoint. Wait, this is true because within a partition, there are no edges. So, for edge AC (A in partition1, C in partition2), any other vertex in partition1 (like B) is not connected to A (since partition1 has no edges) but is connected to C (since partition1 is connected to partition2). Wait, no, wait. If partition1 has vertices A and B, then A is connected to all in partition2, and B is connected to all in partition2. But there&#39;s no edge between A and B. Therefore, for edge AC, town B is not connected to A but is connected to C. Therefore, town B is not connected to A, so is a valid witness. Similarly, town D in partition2 is not connected to C but is connected to A. Therefore, in K_{m,n}, for any edge between partitions, the other vertices in the same partition as one endpoint are not connected to that endpoint but are connected to the other endpoint. Therefore, they are witnesses because they are not connected to one of the endpoints. Therefore, complete bipartite graphs do satisfy the condition. Therefore, my initial confusion was because I was conflating connections between different partitions.Therefore, returning, in a complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}, every edge has a witness in the form of another vertex in the same partition as one endpoint, which is not connected to that endpoint. Therefore, K_{m,n} does satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, if we model the graph as a complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible, we can maximize the number of edges. For n=100, the maximum is achieved when partitions are 50 and 50, giving 50*50=2500 edges.But is this the maximum possible? Could there be a non-bipartite graph with more edges that still satisfies the condition? Let&#39;s think about it.Suppose we have a graph that is not bipartite but has more edges. For example, take a complete bipartite graph K_{50,50} and add a few edges within one partition. Let&#39;s say we add one edge within partition1. Now, this edge, say AB, needs a witness. The witness must be a town not connected to A or B. In partition2, all towns are connected to both A and B. In partition1, other towns are not connected to A or B (since only AB is added). So, if partition1 has 50 towns, adding AB, then for edge AB, any other town in partition1 (say C) is not connected to A or B, so can serve as a witness. Therefore, adding a single edge within partition1 is okay. Similarly, we can add another edge CD in partition1, and for each edge, the witness can be another town in partition1. Therefore, as long as within a partition, the subgraph is such that every edge has a witness within the partition. Wait, but the witnesses within the partition would need to not be connected to at least one endpoint. Since the rest of the graph is complete bipartite, all towns in partition2 are connected to both endpoints. So, witnesses have to be within partition1.Therefore, if we model partition1 as a graph where every edge has a witness within partition1, then we can add edges to partition1. The same logic applies to partition2. Therefore, the total number of edges would be the complete bipartite edges plus the edges within each partition. However, the edges within each partition are constrained by the condition that every edge within partition1 must have a witness, which is another vertex in partition1 not connected to at least one endpoint. Similarly for partition2.Therefore, if we can find a graph on 50 vertices (partition1) that has as many edges as possible, such that every edge has a witness (another vertex not adjacent to at least one endpoint). What&#39;s the maximum number of edges in such a graph?This seems similar to a graph where the complement graph has no isolated vertices. Wait, if every edge in G has a non-adjacent vertex, then in the complement graph, every edge in G corresponds to a non-edge in the complement, and the witness would be a vertex adjacent to at least one endpoint in the complement. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.Alternatively, this problem within partition1 is equivalent to: what&#39;s the maximum number of edges in a graph where every edge has at least one common non-neighbor. That is, for every edge AB, there exists a vertex C not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B.This is similar to a graph with no 2-edge dominating sets? Not sure.Alternatively, such graphs are called &quot;graphs with edge-vertex domination number at least 1&quot;, but I might be making that up.Alternatively, perhaps such graphs are triangle-free? No, because in a triangle, every edge has another edge connected, but in terms of witnesses, a triangle would require a witness for each edge. In a triangle, every vertex is connected to the other two, so for any edge AB, the third vertex C is connected to both A and B, so there is no witness. Therefore, a triangle doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition. So, triangle-free graphs might be necessary but not sufficient.Alternatively, maybe the maximum is achieved by a graph that is the complement of a triangle-free graph. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, if we consider that in partition1, for each edge AB, there must be a vertex C not adjacent to A or B. If partition1 has m vertices, then each edge AB must have at least one vertex C in partition1 not adjacent to A or not adjacent to B.Suppose we have a graph on m vertices where each edge has a non-adjacent vertex. What&#39;s the maximum number of edges?This is similar to a graph where the closed neighborhoods of the vertices cover the edges. Wait, not exactly.Alternatively, if we model this as for every edge AB, there exists a vertex C such that C is not adjacent to A or C is not adjacent to B. This is equivalent to saying that the open neighborhoods of the vertices cover the edges. Because for each edge AB, either A is not in the neighborhood of C, or B is not in the neighborhood of C. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, think of it as for each edge AB, the union of non-neighbors of A and non-neighbors of B is non-empty. So, there exists a vertex C that is a non-neighbor of A or a non-neighbor of B.Therefore, in such a graph, there cannot be an edge AB where both A and B are connected to all other vertices. Because if A and B are connected to all other vertices, then there is no C not adjacent to A or B. Hence, in such a graph, no two vertices can both have degree m-1 (if the graph has m vertices). Therefore, the maximum degree in such a graph can be at most m-2. Because if a vertex has degree m-1, then it is connected to all other vertices. Therefore, no other vertex can have degree m-1, because otherwise, the edge between them would have no witness.So, in such a graph, at most one vertex can have degree m-1. Wait, but if a vertex has degree m-1, then any edge incident to it would need a witness. For example, vertex A has degree m-1, connected to all others. Take edge AB. The witness must be a vertex not connected to A or B. But A is connected to everyone, so the witness must be a vertex not connected to B. But since A is connected to everyone, B is connected to A, but B could have other connections. Wait, if A is connected to everyone, then B is connected to A, but B&#39;s other connections are irrelevant for the witness of edge AB. The witness needs to be not connected to A or not connected to B. Since A is connected to everyone, any witness must be not connected to B. Therefore, if B has at least one non-neighbor, then such a witness exists. But if B is also connected to everyone (degree m-1), then there is no witness. Therefore, in such a graph, if there is a vertex of degree m-1, no other vertex can have degree m-1. So, maximum one vertex of degree m-1.But even if there is a vertex of degree m-1, the other vertices must have degree at most m-2. Therefore, the total number of edges would be at most (m-1) + (m-1)(m-2)/2. Wait, no. Let me think. If one vertex is connected to all others (degree m-1), and the remaining m-1 vertices form a graph where each has degree at most m-2 (but actually, their degrees are in the subgraph). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum such graph is a complete graph missing a matching. But not sure.Alternatively, consider that each edge needs at least one vertex not adjacent to one of its endpoints. If the graph is such that no two vertices are universal (i.e., connected to everyone), then it might satisfy the condition. So, the maximum number of edges would be when as many edges as possible are present without having two universal vertices.But this is vague. Let&#39;s look for known graph types.Wait, perhaps such graphs are called &quot;claw-free&quot; graphs or something else, but I don&#39;t recall.Alternatively, maybe the maximum is achieved by a complete graph minus a matching. For example, if we have m vertices, and remove a set of edges such that no two edges share a vertex (a matching), then in the resulting graph, each edge from the original complete graph that&#39;s still present would have... Wait, not necessarily. If you remove a matching, then for any remaining edge AB, there are two vertices C and D that were matched with A and B, but since it&#39;s a matching, C ≠ D. So, vertex C is not connected to A, and vertex D is not connected to B. Therefore, for edge AB, you can take witness C or D. Therefore, such a graph would satisfy the condition. How many edges would that be? A complete graph on m vertices has m(m-1)/2 edges. Removing a matching of size k reduces the edge count by k. The maximum matching in a complete graph is floor(m/2). So, if we remove a maximum matching, which is 25 edges for m=50, then the remaining graph has (50*49)/2 -25 edges. But wait, 50*49/2 is 1225. Minus 25 is 1200. But in this case, the graph would have 1200 edges. However, the witness condition is satisfied because for any edge AB, there is a vertex C (the one matched with A) not connected to A, and vertex D (matched with B) not connected to B. But in this case, if we remove a maximum matching, each vertex is missing exactly one edge (if m is even). So, each vertex has degree m-2. Then, for any edge AB, since both A and B are missing one connection each, to different vertices. Therefore, the witness for AB can be the vertex that was matched with A (not connected to A) or the vertex matched with B (not connected to B). Therefore, this graph satisfies the condition and has 1200 edges. Then, if we combine this with the complete bipartite graph.Wait, but we&#39;re talking about within a partition. If partition1 has 50 vertices, and we have a graph within partition1 that is a complete graph minus a matching, then the number of edges within partition1 is 1200. Then, the total number of edges in the entire graph (including complete bipartite) would be 1200 (within partition1) + 1200 (within partition2) + 50*50 (between partitions). Wait, but partition1 and partition2 are each 50 vertices. Wait, no, if we&#39;re adding edges within partition1 and within partition2, then the total edges would be:Edges within partition1: 1200Edges within partition2: 1200Edges between partitions: 50*50=2500Total edges: 1200+1200+2500=4900But the original complete bipartite graph has 2500 edges. So, this seems way more. But does this satisfy the condition?Wait, but edges within partition1 and partition2 are now present. So, take an edge AB within partition1. For this edge, we need a witness not connected to A or B. The witness can be within partition1 or partition2. However, partition2 is connected to all of partition1. So, any vertex in partition2 is connected to both A and B. Therefore, witnesses must be within partition1. Since the graph within partition1 is a complete graph minus a matching, then for any edge AB within partition1, there is a vertex C in partition1 not connected to A (if A was matched with C) or a vertex D not connected to B (if B was matched with D). Therefore, the witness exists. Similarly, edges within partition2 are handled the same way. For edges between partitions, which are still present as in complete bipartite, the witness can be found in the other partition. Wait, no. Wait, edges between partitions are not present in this new graph. Wait, no, in this hypothetical graph, we have complete bipartite edges plus edges within partitions. Wait, but in the original complete bipartite graph, there are no edges within partitions. If we add edges within partitions, then the edges between partitions are still there. Wait, no, if we have a graph that is the union of a complete bipartite graph and two graphs within each partition, then the edges between partitions are still the complete bipartite ones. So, for an edge between partition1 and partition2, say AB where A is in partition1 and B is in partition2, the witness would be a vertex in partition1 not connected to B (but in complete bipartite, all of partition1 is connected to B). Wait, no, in the complete bipartite graph, edges between partitions are all present. So, if we have an edge between A (partition1) and B (partition2), then any vertex in partition1 is connected to B, and any vertex in partition2 is connected to A. Therefore, similar to before, there is no witness in the other partition. Wait, but within the same partition, vertices are connected to the other partition. Therefore, for edge AB (between partitions), the witness must be in the same partition as A or B but not connected to the other endpoint.Wait, in partition1, other vertices are connected to B (since it&#39;s complete bipartite). So, vertices in partition1 are connected to B. In partition2, other vertices are connected to A. Therefore, for edge AB, there is no witness in the other partitions. However, within the same partition, if we have added edges, maybe there&#39;s a witness. Wait, no. For edge AB between partitions, witnesses have to be in the same graph. Wait, town C in partition1 is connected to B, town D in partition2 is connected to A. Therefore, the only possible witnesses are within partition1 or partition2, but they are all connected to at least one endpoint. Unless the added edges within the partitions affect this.Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me clarify.If we have a graph that is the union of a complete bipartite graph K_{50,50} and two graphs within each partition (each being a complete graph minus a matching), then:- For edges within partition1: each such edge AB has a witness within partition1 (due to the matching removal), so that&#39;s fine.- For edges within partition2: similarly, each edge CD has a witness within partition2.- For edges between partitions (the original K_{50,50} edges): each edge AB (A in partition1, B in partition2) needs a witness. However, in this combined graph, any vertex in partition1 is connected to B (from the complete bipartite), and any vertex in partition2 is connected to A. Additionally, vertices within partition1 might have additional edges, but those don&#39;t affect the connection to B. Similarly, vertices in partition2 have additional edges, but those don&#39;t affect the connection to A. Therefore, for edge AB between partitions, all vertices in partition1 are connected to B and all in partition2 are connected to A. Therefore, there is no witness for edge AB, because every vertex is connected to at least one of A or B. Therefore, this combined graph does not satisfy the condition for the between-partition edges. Therefore, the initial idea of adding edges within partitions invalidates the witnesses for the between-partition edges.Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work. Therefore, if we want to keep the between-partition edges, which are necessary for the high edge count, we cannot add edges within partitions, because that would break the witness condition for the between-partition edges. Therefore, the complete bipartite graph is optimal, because adding any edges within partitions causes the between-partition edges to lose their witnesses.Therefore, perhaps the maximum is indeed 2500. But wait, the problem states that it&#39;s known that for each two towns A and B connected by a road, there is a town C not connected with at least one of A or B. The problem doesn&#39;t specify that the graph is undirected or has no multiple edges, but I assume it&#39;s a simple undirected graph.Wait, but perhaps there&#39;s another graph structure that isn&#39;t bipartite but still satisfies the condition and has more edges. Let me think.Suppose we have a graph that is a union of multiple complete bipartite graphs. Or, maybe a graph composed of a complete bipartite graph and some other carefully arranged edges. However, adding any edge outside the complete bipartite structure would create an edge that might not have a witness. For example, suppose we have a complete tripartite graph with partitions of size 33, 33, 34. But in a complete tripartite graph, every edge between partitions has all vertices in the third partition connected to both endpoints, so no witnesses. Therefore, complete tripartite graphs are invalid.Alternatively, a graph that is a star graph. A star graph has one central hub connected to all others, and no other edges. In this case, for each edge, the witness can be one of the other leaf nodes. For example, edge AB where A is the hub and B is a leaf. Then, another leaf node C is not connected to B. Wait, no, in a star graph, all leaf nodes are connected to the hub but not to each other. So, for edge AB (hub A and leaf B), town C (another leaf) is not connected to B, so is a witness. Similarly, for any edge between the hub and a leaf, another leaf serves as a witness. However, in a star graph, the number of edges is n-1, which is 99 for n=100. That&#39;s way less than 2500. Therefore, not useful.Alternatively, consider a graph composed of multiple disjoint complete bipartite graphs. For example, multiple K_{50,50} graphs. But we only have 100 vertices, so it would have to be a single K_{50,50}.Alternatively, maybe a graph where each vertex is connected to almost all others, except for a few. For example, a graph where each vertex is not connected to one other vertex. This would be a complete graph minus a matching. As I considered before, such a graph has 100*99/2 - 50 = 4950 - 50 = 4900 edges. But in this graph, for each edge AB, since each vertex is missing only one connection, the witness would be the vertex not connected to A or the vertex not connected to B. For example, if A is not connected to C, and B is not connected to D, then for edge AB, witnesses are C or D. However, if A and B are not connected to different vertices, then both C and D are witnesses. If A and B are not connected to the same vertex C, then C is not connected to either, so C is a witness. Therefore, such a graph satisfies the condition. Therefore, a complete graph minus a matching has 4900 edges and satisfies the condition. That&#39;s much higher than 2500.Wait, this seems contradictory to my earlier reasoning. If this is true, then the maximum number of roads is 4900. But that contradicts the complete bipartite idea. So, where is the mistake here?Wait, let&#39;s check with a smaller example. Take n=4. A complete graph minus a matching would be K4 minus two edges (a matching). So, 6-2=4 edges. Which is the same as K_{2,2}. Indeed, K_{2,2} is a complete bipartite graph and is also a complete graph minus a perfect matching. So, in n=4, both approaches give the same result. And it satisfies the condition.For n=5, a complete graph minus a matching (since n is odd, the matching is 2 edges, leaving one vertex unmatched). So, 10-2=8 edges. Does this graph satisfy the condition? Let&#39;s see. Each edge is part of the complete graph minus two edges. For any edge AB, if neither A nor B is part of the removed matching, then they are connected to all others. Wait, no. In a complete graph minus a matching, each vertex is missing at most one edge. So, for any edge AB, if A is not connected to C, and B is not connected to D, then C and D are witnesses. If A and B are both connected to everyone except their respective matches. Therefore, this should work. For example, in n=5, vertices A,B,C,D,E. Remove edges AC and BD. So, edges removed are AC and BD. Then, for edge AB, which is present, witnesses can be C or D. C is not connected to A, D is not connected to B. For edge AE, since A is only not connected to C, witness is C. For edge BE, B is not connected to D, witness is D. For edge CD, which is present, witnesses can be A or B. A is connected to D, B is connected to C. Wait, no. Edge CD is present. For edge CD, we need a witness not connected to C or D. Vertex A is connected to D (since only AC is removed). Vertex B is connected to C (since only BD is removed). Vertex E is connected to both C and D. Therefore, there is no witness for edge CD. Wait, this is a problem. In this case, edge CD would not have a witness, violating the condition. Therefore, the complete graph minus a matching does not necessarily satisfy the condition for odd n.Ah, so in odd n, when you remove a matching, you have one vertex left. That vertex is connected to all others, so edges incident to it may not have witnesses. For example, in n=5, vertex E is connected to all others. So, edge AE is present, and the witness for AE is C (not connected to A). However, edge CE is present (since only AC and BD are removed). For edge CE, we need a witness not connected to C or E. Town A is connected to E but not to C. So, town A is not connected to C, so it&#39;s a witness. Similarly, edge DE is present. Witness is town B (not connected to D). But edge BE is present. Witness is D (not connected to B). Edge DE: witness is B. So, actually, maybe it does work. Wait, edge CD is present. Witness must be a town not connected to C or D. Towns are A, B, E. Town A is connected to D, town B is connected to C, town E is connected to both C and D. So, no witness for edge CD. Therefore, the graph doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition.Therefore, in odd n, the complete graph minus a matching does not satisfy the condition because of the leftover edges. Therefore, this approach works only for even n. For even n, a complete graph minus a perfect matching (so that each vertex is missing exactly one edge) satisfies the condition. Because for every edge AB, the witness is the vertex not connected to A or the vertex not connected to B. Since it&#39;s a perfect matching, every vertex is missing exactly one edge, so for every edge AB, which is not part of the matching, there are two witnesses: the one matched with A and the one matched with B. If the edge is part of the matching, it&#39;s removed, so not present.Wait, no. In a complete graph minus a perfect matching, the edges removed are the matching edges. The remaining edges are all except the matching. So, for every edge that remains, which is not in the matching, the two endpoints are not matched with each other. Therefore, each endpoint is matched with some other vertex. Therefore, for edge AB, the witnesses would be the vertices C and D, where C is matched with A and D is matched with B. Since C is not connected to A, and D is not connected to B. Therefore, both C and D are witnesses for edge AB. Therefore, in even n, complete graph minus a perfect matching satisfies the condition.For example, in n=4, complete graph minus a perfect matching (two edges) gives K_{2,2}, which is bipartite and satisfies the condition. For n=6, complete graph minus three disjoint edges. Each remaining edge has two witnesses. Therefore, this graph satisfies the condition.Therefore, for even n=100, a complete graph minus a perfect matching (50 edges removed) would have (100*99)/2 -50=4950-50=4900 edges, and satisfies the condition. Therefore, this graph has 4900 edges, which is much more than the complete bipartite graph&#39;s 2500 edges. Therefore, the complete graph minus a perfect matching is a better candidate.Wait, but in the complete graph minus a matching, every edge has two witnesses (the vertices not connected to each endpoint). Therefore, this seems to satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. So, why did I think earlier that complete bipartite was the maximum? Because I didn&#39;t consider this construction.Therefore, this suggests that the maximum number of roads is 4900. But I need to verify this.Let me check with n=4 again. Complete graph has 6 edges. Minus a perfect matching (2 edges), remaining 4 edges, which is K_{2,2}. This is correct and satisfies the condition. For n=6, complete graph has 15 edges. Minus a perfect matching (3 edges), remaining 12 edges. Each edge in the remaining graph has two witnesses. This works. Therefore, generalizing, for even n, the maximum number of edges is n(n-2)/2. Because total edges in complete graph is n(n-1)/2, minus n/2 edges for the perfect matching, giving n(n-1)/2 - n/2 = (n(n-1) -n)/2 = (n^2 -n -n)/2 = (n^2 -2n)/2 = n(n-2)/2. For n=100, this is 100*98/2=4900.Therefore, the graph is a complete graph minus a perfect matching, which has 4900 edges and satisfies the condition that every edge has a witness. Therefore, this seems to be the correct answer.But then why does the complete bipartite graph give only 2500 edges? Because it&#39;s a different structure. The complete graph minus a perfect matching is a much denser graph, utilizing all possible edges except a matching, and hence having almost all possible edges (only 50 missing out of 4950). Therefore, 4900 edges is way more than 2500. Therefore, the answer should be 4900.But I need to ensure that this graph actually satisfies the problem&#39;s condition. For every edge AB, there exists a town C not connected to A or B. In the complete graph minus a perfect matching, every vertex is missing exactly one edge. Therefore, for any edge AB (which is present), vertices A and B are each missing one edge, to different towns (since it&#39;s a perfect matching). Therefore, the town C that is not connected to A is the one matched with A, and the town D that is not connected to B is the one matched with B. Since the matching is perfect, C and D exist and are distinct (since A and B are different). Therefore, both C and D are witnesses for edge AB, since C is not connected to A and D is not connected to B. Therefore, such a graph does satisfy the condition, and has 4900 edges.Therefore, the maximum number of roads is 4900. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{4900}Wait, but hold on. The problem says &quot;for each two towns A and B connected by a road there is a town C which is not connected by a road with at least one of the towns A and B&quot;. So, in the complete graph minus a perfect matching, for any edge AB, there exists a town C not connected to A (the one matched with A) or not connected to B (the one matched with B). Since these are distinct towns, at least one of them exists. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.Therefore, this construction works, and gives 4900 edges. Therefore, this should be the correct answer.But then why did I initially think of complete bipartite graphs? Because in the small case of n=4, both complete bipartite and complete graph minus a matching give the same result. But for larger n, complete graph minus a matching gives a much higher edge count.Therefore, the answer is 4900.Wait, but I need to confirm this with another example. Take n=6. Complete graph minus a perfect matching of 3 edges. So, 15-3=12 edges. For any edge AB, the two witnesses are the towns matched with A and B. Since it&#39;s a perfect matching, those are two distinct towns. For example, if the matching is (A-C), (B-D), (E-F), then for edge AB, the witnesses are C and D. Town C is not connected to A, town D is not connected to B. Both exist. Therefore, satisfies the condition. Similarly, for edge AC, which is removed, but it&#39;s not present. For edge AE, which is present, witnesses are C (not connected to A) and F (not connected to E). Since E is matched with F, F is not connected to E. Therefore, witnesses are C and F. Therefore, this works. Therefore, the complete graph minus a perfect matching does satisfy the condition for any even n.Therefore, in the case of n=100, the maximum number of edges is 100*98/2=4900.Therefore, the answer is boxed{4900}.Final Answerboxed{4900}&lt;/think&gt;Given a problem where we need to determine the maximum number of roads (edges) in a graph of 100 towns (vertices) such that for any two towns (A) and (B) connected by a road, there exists a town (C) not connected by a road to at least one of (A) or (B), we need to find the optimal solution.1. Understanding the Condition: For every edge (AB), there must be a vertex (C) such that (C) is not connected to (A) or (B). This means the graph cannot have any edge (AB) where both (A) and (B) are connected to all other vertices.2. Complete Bipartite Graph Consideration: Initially, a complete bipartite graph (K_{50,50}) was considered, which has (50 times 50 = 2500) edges. However, this was later found to be suboptimal.3. Complete Graph Minus a Perfect Matching: A more optimal solution is a complete graph minus a perfect matching. In a complete graph with (n) vertices, removing a perfect matching (a set of edges where no two edges share a vertex and all vertices are included) results in a graph where each vertex is missing exactly one edge. For (n = 100) (even), this construction ensures that every edge (AB) has a witness (C) (the vertex not connected to (A) or (B) due to the removed matching).4. Edge Calculation: The total number of edges in a complete graph with (n) vertices is (frac{n(n-1)}{2}). Removing a perfect matching (which has (frac{n}{2}) edges) results in:   [   frac{n(n-1)}{2} - frac{n}{2} = frac{n(n-2)}{2}   ]   For (n = 100):   [   frac{100 times 98}{2} = 4900   ]5. Verification: The graph formed by removing a perfect matching from a complete graph satisfies the condition because each edge (AB) will have witnesses (the vertices not connected to (A) or (B) due to the removed edges).Thus, the maximum number of roads possible is (boxed{4900}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🔑:</span>1. Problem Restatement and Graph Representation:   - We are given ( n = 100 ) towns, and we need to determine the maximum number of roads (edges) such that for any two towns ( A ) and ( B ) connected by a road, there exists a town ( C ) which is not connected by a road to at least one of ( A ) or ( B ).   - Represent the towns as vertices of a graph ( G ) and the roads as edges of ( G ).2. Inverse Graph Consideration:   - Consider the complement graph ( overline{G} ) of ( G ). In ( overline{G} ), an edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in ( G ).   - We need to ensure that for every edge ( (u, v) ) in ( G ), there exists a vertex ( w ) such that ( w ) is not adjacent to at least one of ( u ) or ( v ) in ( G ). This translates to ensuring that in ( overline{G} ), for every non-edge ( (u, v) ), the degrees of ( u ) and ( v ) sum to at least 1.3. Minimum Edges in Complement Graph:   - To satisfy the condition in ( overline{G} ), we need to minimize the number of edges in ( overline{G} ) such that no two vertices are isolated. This is because if there are two isolated vertices in ( overline{G} ), their degrees sum to 0, violating the condition.   - The minimum number of edges required to ensure no isolated vertices in ( overline{G} ) is ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ). This is achieved by pairing the vertices such that each vertex has a degree of at most 1 in ( overline{G} ).4. Maximum Edges in Original Graph:   - The total number of possible edges in a complete graph ( K_n ) with ( n ) vertices is ( binom{n}{2} ).   - The number of edges in ( G ) is the total number of possible edges minus the number of edges in ( overline{G} ).   - Therefore, the maximum number of edges in ( G ) is:     [     binom{n}{2} - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor     ]   - For ( n = 100 ):     [     binom{100}{2} - leftlfloor frac{100}{2} rightrfloor = frac{100 cdot 99}{2} - 50 = 4950 - 50 = 4900     ]The final answer is (boxed{4900})</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-e60bd32c data-v-37986e25><div class="review" data-v-37986e25><div class="review-title" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>❓:</span>3. Natural numbers, for which the sum of the digits equals 5, were arranged in ascending order. What number is in the 122-nd position?</div><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the 122nd number in a list of natural numbers whose digits add up to 5, arranged in ascending order. Hmm, let&#39;s see. Let me break this down step by step.First, I need to understand what numbers we are dealing with. Natural numbers where the sum of the digits equals 5. So, examples would be 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 50, 104, 113, etc. These are numbers where when you add up all the digits, the total is 5. Then, these numbers are sorted from smallest to largest, and we need to find which one is in the 122nd position.To approach this, maybe I can think of how many such numbers there are with a certain number of digits, and then try to count up to 122 by considering numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, etc., until I reach the 122nd position. That sounds like a plan.Let&#39;s start with 1-digit numbers. The only 1-digit number that sums to 5 is 5 itself. So that&#39;s one number. Position 1: 5.Next, 2-digit numbers. These are numbers from 10 upwards where the two digits add up to 5. The possible combinations are (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0). Each of these corresponds to a two-digit number. But we have to be careful because numbers can&#39;t start with 0. So for two-digit numbers, the first digit can be from 1 to 5, and the second digit is 5 minus the first digit.So let&#39;s list them:- 14 (1+4=5)- 23 (2+3=5)- 32 (3+2=5)- 41 (4+1=5)- 50 (5+0=5)Wait, but (0,5) would be 05, which is just 5, a one-digit number, so that&#39;s already counted. So actually, there are 5 two-digit numbers. Hmm, so total two-digit numbers: 5. Therefore, positions 2 to 6: 14, 23, 32, 41, 50.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s check the count. The number of two-digit numbers where digits sum to 5. The first digit can be 1 to 5, and the second digit is 5 - first digit. So first digit 1: second digit 4 → 14; first digit 2: second digit 3 →23; first digit 3: second digit 2→32; first digit 4: second digit 1→41; first digit 5: second digit 0→50. So that&#39;s 5 numbers. So total numbers so far: 1 (one-digit) + 5 (two-digit) = 6 numbers. So positions 1-6.Now moving on to three-digit numbers. The three-digit numbers where the digits sum to 5. The digits are a, b, c, each from 0-9, with a ≥1 (since it&#39;s a three-digit number), and a + b + c =5.This is a problem of partitioning 5 into three digits where the first digit is at least 1. So, we can model this as a stars and bars problem, but with constraints.In stars and bars, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =5 is C(5 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(7,2)=21. But since the first digit must be at least 1, we substitute a&#39; = a -1, so a&#39; + b + c =4. Then the number of non-negative solutions is C(4 + 3 -1, 3 -1)=C(6,2)=15. So 15 three-digit numbers. Let me verify this by another method.Alternatively, the first digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since the total sum is 5, and the first digit can&#39;t be 0). For each possible first digit, the remaining two digits must sum to 5 - a.So if a=1, then b + c =4. The number of non-negative solutions is 5 (since for b and c, from 0 to 4, so (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)), which is 5.If a=2, then b + c =3. The number of solutions is 4: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).a=3, b + c=2: solutions: 3: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).a=4, b + c=1: solutions: 2: (0,1), (1,0).a=5, b + c=0: only one solution: (0,0).So total three-digit numbers: 5 +4 +3 +2 +1=15. That matches the stars and bars result. So 15 three-digit numbers. So positions 7 to 21 (6 +15=21). So up to three-digit numbers, we have 21 numbers.Next, four-digit numbers. Let&#39;s see. The four-digit numbers where digits sum to 5. First digit must be at least 1, so the remaining three digits (including leading zeros) sum to 5 -1=4. So again, stars and bars. The number of solutions is C(4 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(7,3)=35. Wait, let me check that.Wait, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 +x2 +x3 +x4 =5 with x1 ≥1 is equivalent to x1&#39; +x2 +x3 +x4 =4, so solutions C(4 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(7,3)=35. So 35 four-digit numbers.Alternatively, we can think of first digit from 1 to 5, and the remaining three digits sum to 5 - a. For each a, compute the number of solutions.a=1: remaining digits sum to 4. Number of non-negative solutions: C(4 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(6,2)=15.a=2: remaining digits sum to 3. C(3 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(5,2)=10.a=3: remaining sum 2. C(2 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(4,2)=6.a=4: remaining sum 1. C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3.a=5: remaining sum 0. C(0 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(2,2)=1.Total four-digit numbers:15+10+6+3+1=35. Yep, matches. So 35 four-digit numbers. Therefore, positions 22 to 56 (21 +35=56). So up to four-digit numbers, 56 numbers.Now, moving on to five-digit numbers. Similarly, first digit at least 1, remaining four digits sum to 4. So the number of solutions is C(4 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(7,3)=35? Wait, no. Wait, the equation is x1 +x2 +x3 +x4 +x5=5, with x1 ≥1. Let me use substitution: x1&#39; =x1 -1, so x1&#39; +x2 +x3 +x4 +x5=4. Then the number of solutions is C(4 +5 -1,5 -1)=C(8,4)=70. Wait, so 70 five-digit numbers.Wait, maybe I need to check this with another method. Let&#39;s do that. For five-digit numbers, first digit a can be 1 to5, and the remaining four digits sum to 5 -a.a=1: remaining digits sum to 4. Number of solutions: C(4 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(7,3)=35.a=2: remaining digits sum to 3: C(3 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(6,3)=20.a=3: remaining digits sum to 2: C(2 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(5,3)=10.a=4: remaining digits sum to1: C(1 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(4,3)=4.a=5: remaining digits sum to0: C(0 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(3,3)=1.So total five-digit numbers:35 +20 +10 +4 +1=70. Correct. So 70 five-digit numbers. Therefore, positions 57 to 126 (56 +70=126). Wait, so positions from 57 to 126 inclusive. Therefore, the 122nd number is within the five-digit numbers. Since 122 is between 57 and 126, so we need to find the (122 -56)=66th five-digit number.So, now the problem reduces to finding the 66th five-digit number where digits sum to5. These numbers are arranged in ascending order. So we need to list five-digit numbers with digits summing to5 in ascending order and pick the 66th one.But how do we generate these numbers in ascending order? Five-digit numbers start from 10000, so the smallest five-digit number with digits summing to5 is 10004 (1+0+0+0+4=5), then 10013, 10022, 10031, 10040, 10103, 10112, etc. But manually listing them up to the 66th would be time-consuming. We need a systematic way.Alternatively, since the numbers are in ascending order, they are ordered numerically. So, to generate them in order, we need to generate numbers from 10000 upwards where digits sum to5. But how to compute the 66th such number without listing all?Alternatively, we can think of the five-digit numbers with digits summing to5 as all numbers from 10000 to 99999 where the sum of digits is5. Since we need the 66th one, we can model this as a combinatorial problem where we iterate through the digits and count how many numbers exist with certain prefixes.Alternatively, think of generating all combinations of digits (a,b,c,d,e) where a≥1 and a+b+c+d+e=5, then converting these to numbers and sorting them. But again, this is equivalent to generating the numbers in order.But maybe we can use the concept of lex order. Since the numbers are in ascending order, which is equivalent to lex order for numbers with the same digit sum. Wait, not exactly. For example, 10004 comes before 10013, which comes before 10022, etc., which is similar to lex order if we consider the digits from left to right.So, the problem reduces to generating the combinations in lex order, which corresponds to the numerical order. So, perhaps we can use the lex order generation to find the 66th combination.To model this, let&#39;s consider the digits as a tuple (a,b,c,d,e) where a≥1 and a+b+c+d+e=5. The numbers are ordered by their numerical value, which is the same as lex order of the tuples (since leading digits have higher weight). So, for example, 10004 is (1,0,0,0,4), which is lex smaller than (1,0,0,1,3)=10013.So, if we can generate the combinations in lex order, then the 66th combination will correspond to the 66th five-digit number.But how do we compute the 66th combination without generating all previous ones?This requires a combinatorial ranking/unranking algorithm. Essentially, given a particular digit combination, we can compute its rank in the lex order, and vice versa. So, if we can compute the unranking, we can find the combination at position 66.To do this, we can iterate through each digit position and determine how many combinations start with a particular digit, then subtract from the target rank until we find the correct digits.Let&#39;s formalize this. Let&#39;s denote the digits as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, where d1 ≥1 and d1 +d2 +d3 +d4 +d5=5. We need to find the 66th combination in lex order.Starting with d1. The possible values for d1 are 1,2,3,4,5. For each possible d1, the number of combinations is the number of non-negative integer solutions to d2 +d3 +d4 +d5=5 -d1.So for d1=1: 5-1=4. The number of solutions is C(4 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(7,3)=35. So combinations starting with 1 are 35 in total.But 35 is less than 66, so the 66th combination is not in d1=1. Subtract 35 from 66: 66-35=31. Now, target rank=31.Next, d1=2: 5-2=3. Number of solutions=C(3 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(6,3)=20. So combinations starting with 2 are 20.31 &gt;20, so subtract 20: 31-20=11. Now, target rank=11.Next, d1=3: 5-3=2. Number of solutions=C(2 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(5,3)=10. 11&gt;10, subtract 10: 11-10=1. Now, target rank=1.Next, d1=4: 5-4=1. Number of solutions=C(1 +4 -1,4 -1)=C(4,3)=4. 1&lt;=4, so the desired combination starts with d1=4, and is the 1st combination in d1=4.So, now, we need to find the 1st combination where d1=4, and d2 +d3 +d4 +d5=1. So, now, moving to d2.For d2, possible values 0,1 (since remaining sum=1). For each d2, the number of combinations is C( (1 -d2) +3 -1,3 -1)=C( (1 -d2) +2,2). Wait, let&#39;s do it step by step.Given that d1=4, remaining sum=1. So d2 can be from 0 to1.For d2=0: remaining sum=1, digits d3 +d4 +d5=1. Number of solutions=C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3.But target rank=1, which is &lt;=3. So the combination is in d2=0, and it&#39;s the 1st combination here. Subtract nothing, target rank remains 1.Now, moving to d3. For d3, possible values 0 to1 (remaining sum=1).For d3=0: remaining sum=1, digits d4 +d5=1. Number of solutions=C(1 +2 -1,2 -1)=C(2,1)=2.But target rank=1 &lt;=2. So it&#39;s in d3=0, and the 1st combination here. Subtract 0, target rank=1.Now, moving to d4. For d4, possible values 0 to1.For d4=0: remaining sum=1, so d5=1. Number of solutions=1.But target rank=1, so we take d4=0, d5=1.Thus, the combination is d1=4, d2=0, d3=0, d4=0, d5=1. Therefore, the number is 40001.Wait, but let&#39;s check. But wait, we were supposed to be in five-digit numbers, so this is 40001.But hold on. Let me check if this is correct. Wait, if d1=4, d2=0, d3=0, d4=0, d5=1, then the number is 4 0 0 0 1 →40001.But is this the first combination when d1=4? Wait, let&#39;s think. When d1=4, the remaining digits sum to1. The numbers starting with 4 followed by digits summing to1. The smallest such number would be 40001, then 40010, 40100, 41000. So four numbers: 40001, 40010, 40100, 41000. Wait, but according to the calculation, there are 4 numbers starting with d1=4 (C(4,3)=4). So the first one is 40001, which would be rank 1. So that seems correct.But according to our calculation, when d1=4, we had target rank=1. Then, in d2=0, we had 3 numbers (d3=0, d4=0, d5=1; d3=0, d4=1, d5=0; d3=1, d4=0, d5=0). Wait, no, actually, when d1=4, d2=0, remaining sum=1. Then, the digits d3, d4, d5 sum to1.The number of solutions is C(1 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(3,2)=3. So there are 3 numbers here:- d3=0, d4=0, d5=1 →40001- d3=0, d4=1, d5=0 →40010- d3=1, d4=0, d5=0 →40100Wait, but where does 41000 come from? That&#39;s when d2=1. Let&#39;s see.Wait, if d2=1, then remaining sum=0. So d3=0, d4=0, d5=0. So 41000.So when d1=4, d2 can be 0 or1.If d2=0, then we have 3 numbers as above.If d2=1, then remaining digits must all be0. So 41000. So total 4 numbers starting with d1=4: 40001, 40010, 40100, 41000.But in our previous calculation, for d1=4, the number of combinations is C(4,3)=4, which matches. So, the 1st combination when d1=4 is 40001.But according to our calculation, with target rank=1, we ended up at 40001. So then, the 66th five-digit number is 40001. However, we need to verify this.But wait, let&#39;s check how many numbers come before this. Let&#39;s recap.Total numbers with:- 1-digit:1- 2-digit:5 → total 6- 3-digit:15 → total 21- 4-digit:35 → total 56- 5-digit:70 → total 126So the 122nd number is the 66th five-digit number (122 -56=66). According to the ranking, the 66th five-digit number is 40001. But wait, that seems too low. 40001 is a relatively small number. Let&#39;s check with some examples.Wait, for example, the first five-digit number is 10004. Then 10013, 10022, 10031, 10040, 10103, 10112, 10121, 10130, 10202, ..., up to 50000.But 40001 is way larger than these. So if 40001 is the 66th five-digit number, that would mean that after 10004, 10013, ..., 40001 is the 66th. But that seems inconsistent because numbers starting with 1 would be first, then numbers starting with 2, etc. So numbers starting with 4 would come after numbers starting with 1,2,3. So 40001 would be in the latter part of the five-digit numbers.But according to our calculation, the 66th five-digit number is 40001. Let&#39;s check how many numbers are there before d1=4.When d1=1, there are 35 numbers.d1=2, 20 numbers. Total so far:35+20=55.d1=3, 10 numbers. Total so far:55+10=65.Then, the next number (66th) is the first number with d1=4, which is 40001. So yes, that seems correct. The first 35 are d1=1, next 20 d1=2, next 10 d1=3, totaling 65, so the 66th is the first with d1=4, which is 40001. But wait, but when you sort all five-digit numbers with digits summing to5, they are ordered numerically, so 10004 comes first, then 10013, etc., then numbers starting with 1 followed by higher digits.But according to the calculation, the numbers starting with d1=1 are all 35 numbers first, then d1=2 next 20, then d1=3 next10, then d1=4 next4, and d1=5 next1. So in the sorted list, all numbers starting with1 come first, followed by those starting with2, etc. But wait, numerically, numbers starting with1 are indeed smaller than those starting with2, etc. So the lex order of the entire number is equivalent to first sorted by d1, then d2, etc.Therefore, the count as per d1 blocks is correct. So 35 numbers starting with1, then 20 with2, 10 with3, 4 with4,1 with5. So, the 66th number is indeed the first number in the d1=4 block, which is 40001.But wait, but when you think numerically, 40001 is 40001, but there are numbers like 10004, 10013, ..., 10040, 10103, etc., which are much smaller. So why is 40001 the 66th number?Because when arranged in ascending order, all numbers starting with1 come first. Since there are 35 such numbers, positions 57-91 (56+35=91). Then numbers starting with2 are next, 20 numbers, positions 92-111 (91+20=111). Then numbers starting with3, 10 numbers, positions 112-121 (111+10=121). Then numbers starting with4, 4 numbers: positions 122-125 (121+4=125). Then the last number starting with5 is 50000, position126.Wait a second, hold on! Wait, my initial calculation was that five-digit numbers start at position57 (since 1+5+15+35=56, so next is57). Then the five-digit numbers total70, so positions57-126. However, when we broke down the five-digit numbers by their first digit:- d1=1:35 numbers, positions57-91- d1=2:20 numbers, positions92-111- d1=3:10 numbers, positions112-121- d1=4:4 numbers, positions122-125- d1=5:1 number, position126Therefore, the 122nd number is the first number in the d1=4 group. Which is the first five-digit number starting with4, which is40001. So, this makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be40001.But let&#39;s verify this. Let&#39;s try to list some numbers in order.Starting with d1=1:The smallest five-digit number is10004 (1+0+0+0+4=5). Then10013, 10022, 10031, 10040, 10103, 10112, 10121, 10130, 10202, 10211, 10220, 10301, 10310, 10400, 11003, 11012, 11021, 11030, 11102, 11111, 11120, 11201, 11210, 11300, 12002, 12011, 12020, 12101, 12110, 12200, 13001, 13010, 13100, 14000. That&#39;s 35 numbers.Then d1=2:Starting with2, the next numbers are20003, 20012, 20021, 20030, 20102, 20111, 20120, 20201, 20210, 20300, 21002, 21011, 21020, 21101, 21110, 21200, 22001, 22010, 22100, 23000. That&#39;s 20 numbers.Then d1=3:30002, 30011, 30020, 30101, 30110, 30200, 31001, 31010, 31100, 32000. That&#39;s10 numbers.Then d1=4:40001, 40010, 40100, 41000. Four numbers.Then d1=5:50000. One number.So, according to this list, the numbers starting with4 are40001,40010,40100,41000. And the first of these,40001, is at position122 (since up to d1=3 is121). Therefore, the 122nd number is40001.But let&#39;s check the count:- d1=1:35 numbers: positions57-91- d1=2:20 numbers:92-111- d1=3:10 numbers:112-121- d1=4:4 numbers:122-125- d1=5:1 number:126Yes, exactly. So the 122nd number is the first in the d1=4 group, which is40001.Therefore, the answer is40001.But wait, just to be thorough, let&#39;s check the exact positions. For example, the first five-digit number is10004 at position57. Then, the 35th five-digit number with d1=1 is14000 at position57+34=91 (since it starts at57). Then, the next number is20003 at position92. Then d1=2 numbers go up to position111. Then d1=3 numbers start at112, and the last d1=3 number is32000 at position121. Then, the next number is40001 at position122. So yes, 40001 is the 122nd number.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{40001}.Final Answerboxed{40001}&lt;/think&gt;To find the 122nd number in the list of natural numbers whose digits sum to 5, arranged in ascending order, we need to consider numbers with different digit lengths and count them systematically.1. 1-digit numbers: Only 5 (1 number).2. 2-digit numbers: 14, 23, 32, 41, 50 (5 numbers). Total: 1 + 5 = 6.3. 3-digit numbers: There are 15 such numbers. Total: 6 + 15 = 21.4. 4-digit numbers: There are 35 such numbers. Total: 21 + 35 = 56.5. 5-digit numbers: There are 70 such numbers. Total: 56 + 70 = 126.The 122nd number falls within the 5-digit numbers. We need to find the 66th 5-digit number (since 122 - 56 = 66).To determine the 66th 5-digit number:- d1=1: 35 numbers (positions 57-91).- d1=2: 20 numbers (positions 92-111).- d1=3: 10 numbers (positions 112-121).- d1=4: 4 numbers (positions 122-125).- d1=5: 1 number (position 126).The 66th 5-digit number is the first number with d1=4. This number is 40001.Thus, the 122nd number is (boxed{40001}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to figure out this problem. So, we need to find the 122nd number in the list of natural numbers where the sum of the digits is 5, arranged in ascending order. Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I need to recall how numbers with a digit sum of 5 look. For example, numbers like 5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 50, 104, 113, etc. Each of these numbers has digits that add up to 5. Now, since they are arranged in ascending order, the first one is 5, then 14, 23, 32, 41, 50, and so on. But to find the 122nd number, I can&#39;t just list them all out; that would take too long. I need a systematic way to count how many numbers there are with different digit lengths and figure out where the 122nd falls. Let me start by considering numbers with different numbers of digits. The digit sum is 5, so the number can have 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, etc. Each time, we need to calculate how many numbers there are for each digit length and keep a running total until we reach 122.Starting with 1-digit numbers: The only 1-digit number with a digit sum of 5 is 5 itself. So that&#39;s 1 number.Next, 2-digit numbers: Here, we need two digits (let&#39;s say a and b) such that a + b = 5, where a is from 1 to 9 (since it&#39;s the first digit and can&#39;t be zero) and b is from 0 to 9. The number of solutions to this is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b = 5, with a ≥ 1. If we let a&#39; = a - 1, then a&#39; + b = 4, which has 5 solutions (since a&#39; and b can be 0-4). So there are 5 two-digit numbers. These would be 14, 23, 32, 41, 50. So that adds 5 numbers, bringing the total to 1 + 5 = 6.Moving on to 3-digit numbers: Here, we need three digits (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 5, with a ≥ 1 (since it&#39;s a 3-digit number) and b, c ≥ 0. Using stars and bars theorem here. If a ≥ 1, let a&#39; = a - 1, then a&#39; + b + c = 4, with a&#39;, b, c ≥ 0. The number of solutions is C(4 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(6, 2) = 15. So 15 three-digit numbers. But wait, let me check with actual examples. The smallest 3-digit number would be 104 (1+0+4=5), then 113, 122, 131, 140, 203, 212, 221, 230, 302, 311, 320, 401, 410, 500. Let&#39;s count these: 104, 113, 122, 131, 140 (5), 203, 212, 221, 230 (4), 302, 311, 320 (3), 401, 410, 500 (3). Total 15, which matches the calculation. So adding 15, the total becomes 6 + 15 = 21.Then 4-digit numbers: Similarly, four digits a + b + c + d = 5, with a ≥ 1. Let a&#39; = a - 1, so a&#39; + b + c + d = 4, all non-negative. The number of solutions is C(4 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(7, 3) = 35. So 35 four-digit numbers. Adding this, total is 21 + 35 = 56.5-digit numbers: Following the same logic. Let a + b + c + d + e = 5, with a ≥ 1. Then a&#39; = a - 1, so a&#39; + b + c + d + e = 4. The number of solutions is C(4 + 5 - 1, 5 - 1) = C(8, 4) = 70. Adding 70, the total becomes 56 + 70 = 126. Hmm, wait, but we need the 122nd number. So the 122nd number is within the 5-digit numbers. Because up to 4-digit numbers, we have 56 numbers, and adding 70 gives us 126, so the 122nd number is the 122 - 56 = 66th number in the 5-digit numbers.Wait, but let me confirm. If the total up to 4 digits is 56, then starting from 57th to 126th positions are 5-digit numbers. So, position 57 is the first 5-digit number, and position 126 is the last 5-digit number. Therefore, position 122 is the 122 - 56 = 66th 5-digit number. So we need to find the 66th 5-digit number where the digits sum to 5. But how are these ordered?Since the numbers are arranged in ascending order, the 5-digit numbers will start from 10004 (1+0+0+0+4=5), then 10013, 10022, 10031, 10040, 10103, 10112, etc. But to find the 66th one, we need a way to list them or to generate them in order.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as the 5-digit numbers with digits summing to 5, sorted ascendingly, and find the 66th one. Since they are sorted, the numbers will start from the smallest possible, which is 10004, then 10013, 10022, 10031, 10040, 10103, 10112, 10121, 10130, 10202, etc.But enumerating 66 numbers manually is tedious. Instead, maybe we can use the concept of generating them in lexicographical order. Since the numbers are in ascending order, which corresponds to lex order for numbers with leading zeros, but since they are natural numbers, leading zeros are not allowed, but we can think of them as strings with digits d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 where d1 &gt;=1 and d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 =5.So to generate them in lex order, which corresponds to ascending numerical order, we can iterate through the digits starting from the left, trying the smallest possible digits first.Alternatively, we can model this as combinations with repetition, but since digits are ordered, it&#39;s more of a stars and bars problem with constraints.But maybe another way: think of the positions of the digits. Since the first digit must be at least 1, and the rest can be 0. So, for 5-digit numbers with digits summing to 5, the first digit can be from 1 to 5, and the remaining four digits sum to (5 - first digit). For each possible first digit, we can compute how many numbers there are with that first digit. Then, using this, we can find which first digit the 66th number has.Wait, perhaps breaking it down:Total 5-digit numbers: 70 (from before). But we need the 66th one. Wait, if the first digit is 1, then the remaining four digits must sum to 4. The number of such numbers is C(4 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(7,3)=35. So numbers starting with 1: 35 numbers. Then starting with 2: remaining digits sum to 3: C(3 + 4 -1,4 -1)=C(6,3)=20. Then starting with 3: remaining sum 2: C(5,3)=10. Starting with 4: remaining sum 1: C(4,3)=4. Starting with 5: remaining sum 0: C(3,3)=1. Let&#39;s check: 35+20+10+4+1=70, correct.So the first 35 numbers (positions 57 to 91) start with 1. Then next 20 (positions 92 to 111) start with 2. Then next 10 (positions 112 to 121) start with 3. Then next 4 (positions 122 to 125) start with 4. Then the last one (position 126) starts with 5.Wait, hold on. So positions 57-91: 35 numbers starting with 1. Then 92-111: 20 numbers starting with 2. Then 112-121: 10 numbers starting with 3. Then 122-125: 4 numbers starting with 4. And 126: starting with 5.But the problem states the 122nd position. So position 122 is the first number starting with 4. So the first number starting with 4 would be 40001, since the remaining digits sum to 1. But let&#39;s confirm.Wait, how are the numbers ordered? For numbers starting with 4, the remaining four digits must sum to 1. So the possible distributions of the remaining 1 among four digits (d2, d3, d4, d5). The possible combinations are:- 1000 (i.e., d2=1, others 0) =&gt; 41000- 0100 =&gt; 40100- 0010 =&gt; 40010- 0001 =&gt; 40001But since the numbers are in ascending order, the smallest number starting with 4 would be 40001, then 40010, then 40100, then 41000. So the order is 40001, 40010, 40100, 41000. Therefore, the four numbers starting with 4 are 40001 (position 122), 40010 (123), 40100 (124), 41000 (125). Then position 126 is 50000.Therefore, the 122nd number is 40001. But wait, hold on. Wait, let&#39;s check if that&#39;s correct.Wait, but maybe when numbers start with 4, the remaining digits can be arranged in ascending order? Wait, no. The numbers are arranged in numerical ascending order. So 40001 is 40,001, which is smaller than 40010 (40,010), which is smaller than 40100 (40,100), etc. So yes, ascending order would have 40001 first. So position 122 is 40001.But let&#39;s check if our previous calculation is correct. The total numbers before 4xxxx are 35 (starting with 1) + 20 (starting with 2) + 10 (starting with 3) = 65 numbers. Wait, but the total numbers up to 3xxxx would be 35 + 20 +10 = 65 numbers. Therefore, starting from position 57 + 65 = 122? Wait, no. Wait, the positions: up to 1xxxx: 35 numbers (positions 57-91). Then 2xxxx: next 20 (92-111). Then 3xxxx: next 10 (112-121). Then 4xxxx: next 4 (122-125). So yes, position 122 is the first 4xxxx number. Which is 40001.But is that correct? Let me see. Let&#39;s think about how the numbers are generated. After all the 3xxxx numbers, which are the numbers from 30000 upwards where the digits sum to 5. The smallest 3xxxx number is 30002 (3+0+0+0+2=5), but wait, hold on. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if the first digit is 3, the remaining four digits must sum to 2. So the possible numbers are 30002, 30011, 30101, 30200, 31001, 31100, 32000. But in ascending order, these would be 30002, 30011, 30101, 30200, 31001, 31100, 32000. Wait, that&#39;s seven numbers, but we previously calculated 10 numbers starting with 3. Wait, there&#39;s a discrepancy here.Wait, no. If first digit is 3, then the remaining digits sum to 2. The number of such numbers is C(2 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(5,3) = 10. But when I list them, I only get 7. Wait, something&#39;s wrong here.Wait, perhaps my mistake is in how I list the numbers. Let&#39;s take first digit 3, then the remaining four digits (d2, d3, d4, d5) must sum to 2. The number of solutions is C(2 + 4 -1, 4 -1) = C(5,3) = 10. So there should be 10 numbers. Let me list them properly.The possible distributions of 2 among the four digits:- 2000: digits 2,0,0,0 =&gt; number 32000- 1100: digits 1,1,0,0 =&gt; number 31100- 1010: digits 1,0,1,0 =&gt; number 31010- 1001: digits 1,0,0,1 =&gt; number 31001- 0200: digits 0,2,0,0 =&gt; number 30200- 0110: digits 0,1,1,0 =&gt; number 30110- 0101: digits 0,1,0,1 =&gt; number 30101- 0020: digits 0,0,2,0 =&gt; number 30020- 0011: digits 0,0,1,1 =&gt; number 30011- 0002: digits 0,0,0,2 =&gt; number 30002So these are 10 numbers. Now, arranging them in ascending order:30002, 30011, 30020, 30101, 30110, 30200, 31001, 31010, 31100, 32000.So the order is correct. Therefore, numbers starting with 3 are 10 in total. Then, numbers starting with 4 would be the next four, as we discussed. So positions 112-121: the 10 numbers starting with 3. Then positions 122-125: the four numbers starting with 4.Therefore, the 122nd number is the first number starting with 4, which is 40001. Hence, the answer is 40001. But let me double-check.Wait, let&#39;s verify the count again. Total numbers:1-digit: 1 (pos 1)2-digit: 5 (pos 2-6)3-digit:15 (pos7-21)4-digit:35 (pos22-56)5-digit:70 (pos57-126)So position 122 is indeed in the 5-digit numbers, specifically the 122 -56=66th 5-digit number.Earlier, we broke down the 5-digit numbers into:Starting with 1:35 (pos57-91)Starting with 2:20 (pos92-111)Starting with3:10 (pos112-121)Starting with4:4 (pos122-125)Starting with5:1 (pos126)So yes, pos122 is first of the starting with4 numbers. Which is 40001.But wait, when we listed the numbers starting with3, the last one was 32000. Then the next number should be the first starting with4, which is 40001. Let&#39;s check numerical order. 32000 is 32,000. Then the next number would be 40001, which is 40,001. There&#39;s a jump here. Are there no numbers between 32,000 and 40,001 with digit sum 5?Wait, there might be numbers starting with 4, but with more digits. Wait, but we&#39;re only considering 5-digit numbers here. The next number after 5-digit numbers would be 6-digit numbers, but since we&#39;re only dealing with 5-digit numbers here (as per the count up to 70), the next number after 32000 (which is 5-digit) is 40001. So in ascending order, 32000 (32,000) is followed by 40001 (40,001). But 32,000 is less than 40,001, so numerically, that&#39;s correct. But are there any numbers between them with digit sum 5?For example, numbers like 100004 (but that&#39;s 6-digit, which we aren&#39;t considering here because the 5-digit numbers go up to 50,000). Wait, no. All 5-digit numbers with digit sum 5 are from 10004 to 50000. So after 32000, the next 5-digit number with digit sum 5 is 40001. There are no 5-digit numbers between 32000 and 40001 that have a digit sum of 5. For example, let&#39;s take 33000: digits sum to 3+3+0+0+0=6, which is too much. 34000:3+4=7. Similarly, 32001:3+2+0+0+1=6. So no, there are no numbers in between. So 32000 is followed by 40001. Therefore, the order is correct.Hence, the 122nd number is 40001. Therefore, the answer should be boxed{40001}.Final Answerboxed{40001}&lt;/think&gt;To find the 122nd number in the list of natural numbers where the sum of the digits equals 5, arranged in ascending order, we need to consider numbers with different digit lengths and count them systematically.1. 1-digit numbers: Only 1 number (5).2. 2-digit numbers: 5 numbers (14, 23, 32, 41, 50).3. 3-digit numbers: 15 numbers (e.g., 104, 113, 122, ..., 500).4. 4-digit numbers: 35 numbers (e.g., 1004, 1013, 1022, ..., 5000).The total count up to 4-digit numbers is (1 + 5 + 15 + 35 = 56). Therefore, the 122nd number must be a 5-digit number. For 5-digit numbers, the count is 70. We need the 66th 5-digit number (since (122 - 56 = 66)). Breaking down the 5-digit numbers:- Numbers starting with 1: 35 (positions 57-91)- Numbers starting with 2: 20 (positions 92-111)- Numbers starting with 3: 10 (positions 112-121)- Numbers starting with 4: 4 (positions 122-125)- Numbers starting with 5: 1 (position 126)The 66th 5-digit number falls in the group starting with 4. The first number in this group is 40001, which is the 122nd number overall.Thus, the 122nd number is (boxed{40001}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🔑:</span>Answer: 40001.Solution: see 9th grade.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-e60bd32c data-v-37986e25><div class="review" data-v-37986e25><div class="review-title" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>❓:</span>Given the functions f(x)=ln (1+x)-x and g(x)=xln x.(I) Find the maximum value of the function f(x);(II) Prove that 0 &lt; g(a)+g(b)-2g(frac{a+b}{2}) &lt; (b-a)ln 2 for 0 &lt; a &lt; b.</div><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem with two parts. Let me start with part (I): finding the maximum value of the function f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x. Hmm, maximum value. Since it&#39;s a function of one variable, I should probably take its derivative, find critical points, and then determine which one is the maximum.First, let&#39;s recall that ln(1 + x) is the natural logarithm function, which is defined for x &gt; -1. But since the function is f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x, and we might be looking for a maximum, I need to consider the domain where the function is defined. The problem doesn&#39;t specify the domain, but since ln(1 + x) requires 1 + x &gt; 0, so x &gt; -1. But maybe the problem is considering x ≥ 0? Wait, the original problem mentions part (II) with 0 &lt; a &lt; b, so maybe part (I) is also considering x &gt; 0? Hmm, not sure. But let&#39;s check.Wait, the function f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x. Let&#39;s find its derivative. The derivative of ln(1 + x) is 1/(1 + x), and the derivative of -x is -1. So f&#39;(x) = 1/(1 + x) - 1. To find critical points, set f&#39;(x) = 0:1/(1 + x) - 1 = 01/(1 + x) = 1Multiply both sides by (1 + x):1 = 1 + xSubtract 1: 0 = xSo x = 0 is the critical point. Now, to check if this is a maximum or minimum. Let&#39;s take the second derivative.The first derivative is f&#39;(x) = 1/(1 + x) - 1. The derivative of 1/(1 + x) is -1/(1 + x)^2, and the derivative of -1 is 0. So the second derivative f&#39;&#39;(x) = -1/(1 + x)^2.At x = 0, f&#39;&#39;(0) = -1/(1 + 0)^2 = -1, which is negative. Therefore, by the second derivative test, x = 0 is a local maximum. So the maximum value of f(x) is f(0) = ln(1 + 0) - 0 = ln(1) = 0. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check.Wait, when x approaches -1 from the right, ln(1 + x) goes to negative infinity, and -x goes to 1, so the function f(x) tends to negative infinity. As x approaches infinity, ln(1 + x) grows logarithmically, while -x goes to negative infinity, so f(x) tends to negative infinity as x approaches infinity. So the only critical point is at x = 0, which is a local maximum. Since the function tends to negative infinity on both sides, the maximum value is indeed at x = 0, which is 0. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 0. So part (I) answer is 0.Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the function around x = 0. Let me plug in x = 0. f(0) = ln(1) - 0 = 0. What about x = 1? f(1) = ln(2) - 1 ≈ 0.6931 - 1 ≈ -0.3069. Negative. x = -0.5? Wait, x must be greater than -1. Let&#39;s take x = -0.5: ln(0.5) - (-0.5) = -0.6931 + 0.5 ≈ -0.1931. Still negative. What about x approaching 0 from the left? For x approaching 0 from the left, like x = -0.1: ln(0.9) - (-0.1) ≈ -0.1054 + 0.1 ≈ -0.0054. Still negative. So at x = 0, it&#39;s 0. So indeed, the maximum value is 0 at x = 0. So part (I) is solved.Now part (II): Prove that 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) &lt; (b - a)ln2 for 0 &lt; a &lt; b. The function g(x) is x ln x. So first, let&#39;s write down the expression:g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) = a ln a + b ln b - 2 * [( (a + b)/2 ) ln( (a + b)/2 )]Simplify that expression:First, compute 2 * [( (a + b)/2 ) ln( (a + b)/2 )] = (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )Therefore, the expression becomes:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )We need to show that this expression is between 0 and (b - a) ln2.First, let&#39;s see if we can manipulate the expression.Let me write it as:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )= a [ ln a - ln( (a + b)/2 ) ] + b [ ln b - ln( (a + b)/2 ) ]= a ln [ a / ( (a + b)/2 ) ] + b ln [ b / ( (a + b)/2 ) ]Simplify the arguments inside the logarithms:a / ( (a + b)/2 ) = 2a / (a + b )Similarly, b / ( (a + b)/2 ) = 2b / (a + b )Therefore, the expression becomes:a ln(2a/(a + b)) + b ln(2b/(a + b))= a [ ln2 + ln a - ln(a + b) ] + b [ ln2 + ln b - ln(a + b) ]= a ln2 + a ln a - a ln(a + b) + b ln2 + b ln b - b ln(a + b)Combine like terms:ln2(a + b) + (a ln a + b ln b) - (a + b) ln(a + b)But this is the same as the original expression. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s consider substituting variables. Let me denote t = (b - a)/2, so that a = c - t, b = c + t, where c = (a + b)/2. Then the expression becomes:g(c - t) + g(c + t) - 2g(c)= (c - t) ln(c - t) + (c + t) ln(c + t) - 2c ln cMaybe this substitution can help. Let&#39;s see:Expand each term:(c - t) ln(c - t) + (c + t) ln(c + t) - 2c ln c= c [ ln(c - t) + ln(c + t) ] - t [ ln(c - t) - ln(c + t) ] - 2c ln cSimplify:= c [ ln((c - t)(c + t)) ] - t [ ln( (c - t)/(c + t) ) ] - 2c ln c= c ln(c² - t²) - t ln( (c - t)/(c + t) ) - 2c ln c= c [ ln(c² - t²) - 2 ln c ] - t ln( (c - t)/(c + t) )= c ln( (c² - t²)/c² ) - t ln( (c - t)/(c + t) )= c ln(1 - t²/c² ) - t ln( (c - t)/(c + t) )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let&#39;s think of this expression as the difference between g(a) + g(b) and 2g((a + b)/2). Since g(x) = x ln x, this is similar to the concept of convexity or concavity. If g(x) is convex or concave, then we can apply Jensen&#39;s inequality.Wait, let&#39;s check the second derivative of g(x). The first derivative of g(x) = x ln x is g&#39;(x) = ln x + 1. The second derivative is g&#39;&#39;(x) = 1/x. Since x is in (0, ∞), and in our case 0 &lt; a &lt; b, so x is positive. Therefore, g&#39;&#39;(x) = 1/x &gt; 0 for x &gt; 0. So g(x) is convex on its domain. Therefore, by Jensen&#39;s inequality, for a convex function, we have:(g(a) + g(b))/2 ≥ g( (a + b)/2 )Multiplying both sides by 2:g(a) + g(b) ≥ 2g( (a + b)/2 )Which implies that g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) ≥ 0. But the problem states 0 &lt; ... So we need to show that the inequality is strict, i.e., not equal to zero. Since a ≠ b (because 0 &lt; a &lt; b), and g is strictly convex, the inequality is strict. Therefore, 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ). That gives the left inequality.Now, for the right inequality: proving that g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) &lt; (b - a) ln2.Hmm, how to approach this. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s consider the expression:g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )We need to show that this is less than (b - a) ln2.Let me try to manipulate the expression. Let&#39;s set t = (b - a)/2. Then b = a + 2t. Let me substitute b = a + 2t into the expression.So, substituting:a ln a + (a + 2t) ln(a + 2t) - (a + (a + 2t)) ln( (a + (a + 2t))/2 )Simplify:a ln a + (a + 2t) ln(a + 2t) - (2a + 2t) ln( (2a + 2t)/2 )= a ln a + (a + 2t) ln(a + 2t) - 2(a + t) ln(a + t)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the expression as a function of a and b and take partial derivatives? Maybe not. Alternatively, let&#39;s consider substituting variables such that u = a, v = b, and then express in terms of u and v. Wait, maybe another approach.Let me write the expression as:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )= a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) [ ln(a + b) - ln2 ]= a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b) + (a + b) ln2So the expression is:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b) + (a + b) ln2= (a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)) + (a + b) ln2But not sure. Let&#39;s see, maybe we can compare this expression to (b - a) ln2. Let&#39;s see.Wait, maybe we can use the Mean Value Theorem for the function g(x) = x ln x. Since g is convex, maybe the difference g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) relates to the derivative of g at some point.Alternatively, consider that the expression is the difference between the sum g(a) + g(b) and twice the value at the midpoint. For convex functions, this difference is related to the variance or something similar. Hmm.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the function h(x) = g(x) = x ln x. Then the expression h(a) + h(b) - 2h((a + b)/2). Let me consider expanding h around the midpoint.Let c = (a + b)/2, and let t = (b - a)/2, so that a = c - t, b = c + t.Then h(a) = h(c - t) and h(b) = h(c + t). Let&#39;s perform a Taylor expansion of h(c - t) and h(c + t) around c.h(c + t) ≈ h(c) + h&#39;(c) t + (1/2) h&#39;&#39;(c) t² + (1/6) h&#39;&#39;&#39;(c) t³ + ...Similarly, h(c - t) ≈ h(c) - h&#39;(c) t + (1/2) h&#39;&#39;(c) t² - (1/6) h&#39;&#39;&#39;(c) t³ + ...Adding these two:h(c + t) + h(c - t) ≈ 2h(c) + h&#39;&#39;(c) t²Therefore, h(a) + h(b) - 2h(c) ≈ h&#39;&#39;(c) t²But h&#39;&#39;(x) = 1/x, so h&#39;&#39;(c) = 1/c.Therefore, the expression is approximately (1/c) t² = (1/c) * ( (b - a)/2 )² = ( (b - a)^2 ) / (4c )But the problem states that the expression is less than (b - a) ln2. So if we have this approximation, (b - a)^2 / (4c ) &lt; (b - a) ln2, which would require (b - a)/4c &lt; ln2. But since c = (a + b)/2, so substituting, (b - a)/(4*( (a + b)/2 )) = (b - a)/(2(a + b)) ). Therefore, (b - a)/(2(a + b)) &lt; ln2. But this might not hold for all 0 &lt; a &lt; b. For example, if a approaches b, then (b - a)/(2(a + b)) approaches 0, which is certainly less than ln2. But if a is very small and b is large, say a approaches 0 and b approaches infinity, then (b - a)/(2(a + b)) ≈ b/(2b) = 1/2, which is approximately 0.5, and ln2 ≈ 0.693, so 0.5 &lt; 0.693, which is true. So the approximation suggests that (b - a)^2 / (4c ) &lt; (b - a) ln2 when (b - a)/(2(a + b)) &lt; ln2. However, since the exact expression may be different because the Taylor expansion is only up to the second derivative, and higher-order terms might be involved. So this approach may not be sufficient.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to bound the expression. Let&#39;s go back to the original expression:g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )Let me factor out (a + b):= (a + b) [ (a/(a + b)) ln a + (b/(a + b)) ln b ] - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )= (a + b) [ (a/(a + b)) ln a + (b/(a + b)) ln b - ln( (a + b)/2 ) ]Notice that (a/(a + b)) and (b/(a + b)) are weights that sum to 1. Let me denote p = a/(a + b), so that 1 - p = b/(a + b). Then the expression becomes:= (a + b) [ p ln a + (1 - p) ln b - ln( (a + b)/2 ) ]But p = a/(a + b), so a = p(a + b). Similarly, b = (1 - p)(a + b). Therefore:= (a + b) [ p ln (p(a + b)) + (1 - p) ln ( (1 - p)(a + b) ) - ln( (a + b)/2 ) ]Expand the logs:= (a + b) [ p ( ln p + ln(a + b) ) + (1 - p)( ln(1 - p) + ln(a + b) ) - ln(a + b) + ln2 ]Simplify:= (a + b) [ p ln p + p ln(a + b) + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + (1 - p) ln(a + b) - ln(a + b) + ln2 ]Combine the terms with ln(a + b):p ln(a + b) + (1 - p) ln(a + b) = ln(a + b)(p + 1 - p) = ln(a + b)So:= (a + b) [ ln(a + b) + p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) - ln(a + b) + ln2 ]Simplify further:= (a + b) [ p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 ]So the expression simplifies to:(a + b) [ p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 ]But p = a/(a + b). Let&#39;s denote that p is between 0 and 1 because 0 &lt; a &lt; b. So 0 &lt; p &lt; 1/2 (since a &lt; b). Wait, because if a &lt; b, then p = a/(a + b) &lt; b/(a + b) = 1 - p, so p &lt; 1/2.Therefore, the term inside the brackets is [ p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 ]. Let&#39;s analyze this term. Let&#39;s denote h(p) = p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2. We need to show that this is less than (b - a)/ (a + b) * ln2. Wait, but our expression is (a + b) h(p) &lt; (b - a) ln2. Wait, since p = a/(a + b), then (b - a) = (a + b)(1 - 2p). Wait, because:If p = a/(a + b), then 1 - 2p = (a + b - 2a)/(a + b) = (b - a)/(a + b). Therefore, (b - a) = (a + b)(1 - 2p). So substituting into the inequality:(a + b) h(p) &lt; (a + b)(1 - 2p) ln2Divide both sides by (a + b) (since a + b &gt; 0):h(p) &lt; (1 - 2p) ln2Therefore, we need to show that:p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 &lt; (1 - 2p) ln2Rearranging:p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) &lt; (1 - 2p) ln2 - ln2 + ln2 ?Wait, no. Wait, starting from h(p) = p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 &lt; (1 - 2p) ln2Therefore, h(p) = p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) + ln2 &lt; (1 - 2p) ln2Subtract ln2 from both sides:p ln p + (1 - p) ln(1 - p) &lt; -2p ln2Wait, but this seems not straightforward. Maybe we can rearrange:Let me denote q = 1 - p, so q = 1 - a/(a + b) = b/(a + b). Since a &lt; b, q &gt; 1/2. Then the term h(p) becomes:p ln p + q ln q + ln2And we need to show that this is less than (1 - 2p) ln2 = (q - p) ln2Hmm. So:p ln p + q ln q + ln2 &lt; (q - p) ln2Let me rearrange:p ln p + q ln q &lt; (q - p - 1) ln2Wait, that doesn&#39;t look right. Wait, (q - p) is equal to (b - a)/(a + b). Wait, maybe this substitution complicates things. Let&#39;s try plugging in some numbers. Let&#39;s take a = 1 and b = 3. Then c = (1 + 3)/2 = 2. Then:g(1) + g(3) - 2g(2) = 1*ln1 + 3*ln3 - 2*(2*ln2) = 0 + 3 ln3 - 4 ln2Calculate 3 ln3 ≈ 3*1.0986 ≈ 3.2958; 4 ln2 ≈ 4*0.6931 ≈ 2.7724. So the expression ≈ 3.2958 - 2.7724 ≈ 0.5234.Now (b - a) ln2 = (3 -1)*0.6931 ≈ 2*0.6931 ≈ 1.3862. So 0.5234 &lt; 1.3862, which holds.Now let&#39;s check another pair. Let a approach 0, say a = 0.1, b = 1. Then c = 0.55. Compute g(0.1) + g(1) - 2g(0.55) = 0.1 ln0.1 + 1 ln1 - 2*(0.55 ln0.55). Compute:0.1 ln0.1 ≈ 0.1*(-2.3026) ≈ -0.23031 ln1 = 00.55 ln0.55 ≈ 0.55*(-0.5978) ≈ -0.3288Multiply by 2: -0.6576Therefore, total expression: -0.2303 + 0 - (-0.6576) = 0.4273(b - a) ln2 = (1 - 0.1)*0.6931 ≈ 0.9*0.6931 ≈ 0.6238. So 0.4273 &lt; 0.6238, which holds.Another test case: a = 1, b = 2. Then c = 1.5.g(1) + g(2) - 2g(1.5) = 1*ln1 + 2*ln2 - 2*(1.5 ln1.5)≈ 0 + 2*0.6931 - 3*0.4055 ≈ 1.3862 - 1.2165 ≈ 0.1697(b - a) ln2 = 1*0.6931 ≈ 0.6931, which is larger. So yes, holds.So empirically it seems to hold. Now, how to prove it.Wait, let&#39;s recall that the expression we need to bound is:g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )We need to show this is less than (b - a) ln2.Let me consider the function h(x) = x ln x. Then the expression is h(a) + h(b) - 2h((a + b)/2). Let&#39;s use the Mean Value Theorem for divided differences. For a twice differentiable function, the difference h(a) + h(b) - 2h((a + b)/2) can be expressed in terms of the second derivative.Indeed, by Taylor&#39;s theorem, for a function h(x) around the midpoint c = (a + b)/2, we have:h(a) = h(c - t) = h(c) - t h&#39;(c) + (t²/2) h&#39;&#39;(ξ₁) for some ξ₁ between c - t and c.Similarly, h(b) = h(c + t) = h(c) + t h&#39;(c) + (t²/2) h&#39;&#39;(ξ₂) for some ξ₂ between c and c + t.Adding these two:h(a) + h(b) = 2h(c) + (t²/2)(h&#39;&#39;(ξ₁) + h&#39;&#39;(ξ₂))Therefore, h(a) + h(b) - 2h(c) = (t²/2)(h&#39;&#39;(ξ₁) + h&#39;&#39;(ξ₂))For h(x) = x ln x, h&#39;&#39;(x) = 1/x. So h&#39;&#39;(ξ) = 1/ξ.Thus, the expression becomes:(t²/2)(1/ξ₁ + 1/ξ₂ )Since ξ₁ is in (c - t, c) and ξ₂ is in (c, c + t), and since c = (a + b)/2, t = (b - a)/2.Therefore, ξ₁ ≥ a and ξ₂ ≤ b.So 1/ξ₁ + 1/ξ₂ ≤ 1/a + 1/b.But then:h(a) + h(b) - 2h(c) ≤ (t²/2)(1/a + 1/b )But t = (b - a)/2, so t² = (b - a)^2 /4. Hence:≤ ( (b - a)^2 / 8 )(1/a + 1/b )= (b - a)^2 (a + b) / (8ab )But we need to show that the original expression is less than (b - a) ln2. Therefore, this approach gives an upper bound of (b - a)^2 (a + b)/(8ab ). But this is not necessarily less than (b - a) ln2. For example, take a =1, b=3:(b - a)^2 (a + b)/(8ab ) = (2)^2 (4)/(8*1*3) = 4*4 /24 = 16/24 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. And (b - a) ln2 = 2*0.6931 ≈ 1.3862. So indeed 0.6667 &lt; 1.3862. But for a =0.1, b=1:(b - a)^2 (a + b)/(8ab ) = (0.9)^2 (1.1)/(8*0.1*1) = 0.81*1.1 /0.8 ≈ 0.891/0.8 ≈ 1.11375. While (b - a) ln2 =0.9*0.6931≈0.6238. Wait, here the upper bound from the Taylor expansion is larger than (b - a) ln2, which contradicts. So this method gives an upper bound that&#39;s not always less than (b - a) ln2. Therefore, this approach might not work.Alternatively, maybe integrating the derivative. Let&#39;s consider the function H(t) = g(a) + g(t) - 2g( (a + t)/2 ), for t &gt; a. We need to show that H(t) &lt; (t - a) ln2. Let&#39;s compute H&#39;(t):H(t) = a ln a + t ln t - 2*( (a + t)/2 ) ln( (a + t)/2 )= a ln a + t ln t - (a + t) ln( (a + t)/2 )Then H&#39;(t) = ln t + 1 - [ ln( (a + t)/2 ) + (a + t)* (1/( (a + t)/2 )) * (1/2) ]Wait, derivative of (a + t) ln( (a + t)/2 ) with respect to t is:First term: derivative of (a + t) is 1, times ln( (a + t)/2 ), plus (a + t) times derivative of ln( (a + t)/2 ), which is 1/( (a + t)/2 ) * (1/2 )So overall:1 * ln( (a + t)/2 ) + (a + t) * [ 1/( (a + t)/2 ) * (1/2) ]= ln( (a + t)/2 ) + (a + t) * (2/(a + t)) * (1/2 )= ln( (a + t)/2 ) + 1Therefore, H&#39;(t) = ln t + 1 - [ ln( (a + t)/2 ) + 1 ] = ln t - ln( (a + t)/2 ) = ln( 2t/(a + t) )We need to show that H(t) &lt; (t - a) ln2. Let&#39;s check H(a):At t = a, H(a) = a ln a + a ln a - 2g(a) = 2a ln a - 2a ln a = 0. Which matches the left inequality. Now, compute H&#39;(t) = ln( 2t/(a + t) )We need to analyze H&#39;(t). Let&#39;s note that 2t/(a + t) = 2/(1 + a/t ). As t increases from a to infinity, a/t decreases from 1 to 0, so 2/(1 + a/t ) increases from 1 to 2. Therefore, ln(2t/(a + t)) increases from ln1 = 0 to ln2. Hence, H&#39;(t) is increasing from 0 to ln2. Therefore, H(t) is a function whose derivative starts at 0 and increases to ln2. Therefore, H(t) is convex in t. The maximum slope is ln2, so the function H(t) grows at a rate approaching ln2 as t increases. Let&#39;s integrate H&#39;(t) from a to b:H(b) = ∫_{a}^b H&#39;(t) dt = ∫_{a}^b ln(2t/(a + t)) dtBut since H&#39;(t) is increasing from 0 to ln2, the integral is less than the maximum slope times the interval length:∫_{a}^b H&#39;(t) dt &lt; ln2 * (b - a)Therefore, H(b) &lt; (b - a) ln2. Which is exactly the right inequality we need to prove. Therefore, this completes the proof.Therefore, summarizing:(I) The maximum value of f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x is 0 at x = 0.(II) By using the Mean Value Theorem and analyzing the derivative, we showed that 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a + b)/2) &lt; (b - a) ln2 for 0 &lt; a &lt; b.Final Answer(I) The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is boxed{0}.(II) The inequality ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) is proven as required.&lt;/think&gt;(I) To find the maximum value of the function ( f(x) = ln(1 + x) - x ):1. Compute the first derivative: ( f&#39;(x) = frac{1}{1 + x} - 1 ).2. Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points: ( frac{1}{1 + x} - 1 = 0 ). Solving this gives ( x = 0 ).3. Compute the second derivative: ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = -frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} ).4. Evaluate the second derivative at ( x = 0 ): ( f&#39;&#39;(0) = -1 ), which is negative, indicating a local maximum.5. Evaluate ( f(0) ): ( ln(1 + 0) - 0 = 0 ).Thus, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{0}).(II) To prove ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) for ( 0 &lt; a &lt; b ):1. Left Inequality (Strict Convexity):   - The function ( g(x) = x ln x ) is convex since its second derivative ( g&#39;&#39;(x) = frac{1}{x} &gt; 0 ) for ( x &gt; 0 ).   - By Jensen&#39;s inequality for convex functions: ( frac{g(a) + g(b)}{2} geq gleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) ).   - Multiplying by 2 gives ( g(a) + g(b) geq 2gleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) ). Since ( a neq b ), the inequality is strict: ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) ).2. Right Inequality (Bounding the Expression):   - Consider the function ( H(t) = g(a) + g(t) - 2gleft(frac{a + t}{2}right) ).   - Compute the derivative ( H&#39;(t) = lnleft(frac{2t}{a + t}right) ).   - Analyze ( H&#39;(t) ): It is increasing from 0 to ( ln 2 ) as ( t ) increases from ( a ) to infinity.   - Integrate ( H&#39;(t) ) from ( a ) to ( b ): The integral is less than the maximum slope ( ln 2 ) times the interval length ( b - a ), giving ( H(b) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ).Thus, the inequality ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) is proven. Final answers:(I) (boxed{0})(II) The inequality is proven as required.,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. There are two parts here: finding the maximum of the function f(x) = ln(1+x) - x, and then proving an inequality involving the function g(x) = x ln x. Let&#39;s start with part I.Part I: Finding the maximum of f(x) = ln(1+x) - xFirst, since we need to find the maximum value of f(x), the natural approach is to use calculus. To find maxima or minima of a function, we typically take its derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then we can check if that critical point is indeed a maximum.So let&#39;s compute the first derivative of f(x). The derivative of ln(1+x) is 1/(1+x), and the derivative of -x is -1. Therefore, f&#39;(x) = 1/(1+x) - 1.Now, set f&#39;(x) = 0 to find critical points:1/(1+x) - 1 = 0Let&#39;s solve this equation:1/(1+x) = 1Multiply both sides by (1+x):1 = 1 + xSubtract 1 from both sides:0 = xSo, x = 0 is the critical point. But wait, we need to confirm if this is a maximum or a minimum. For that, we can use the second derivative test.Compute the second derivative f&#39;&#39;(x). The first derivative is 1/(1+x) - 1, so the derivative of that is -1/(1+x)^2 - 0 = -1/(1+x)^2. Therefore, f&#39;&#39;(x) = -1/(1+x)^2.Evaluate the second derivative at x = 0:f&#39;&#39;(0) = -1/(1+0)^2 = -1. Since f&#39;&#39;(0) is negative, this means the function is concave downward at x = 0, so the critical point x = 0 is a local maximum.But wait, the function f(x) = ln(1+x) - x is defined for x &gt; -1, but since we have ln(1+x), x must be greater than -1. However, since x = 0 is the critical point, and the second derivative here is negative, this is indeed the maximum. Let&#39;s check the behavior of the function as x approaches -1 and as x approaches infinity to ensure that there are no other critical points or higher maxima.As x approaches -1 from the right (since the domain is x &gt; -1), ln(1+x) tends to negative infinity, and -x tends to 1. So the function f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches infinity, ln(1+x) grows logarithmically, while -x grows negatively linearly. So ln(1+x) - x will tend to negative infinity as x approaches infinity. Therefore, the only critical point is at x = 0, which is a local maximum, and since the function tends to negative infinity on both ends, this must be the global maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is f(0). Let&#39;s compute that:f(0) = ln(1 + 0) - 0 = ln(1) - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0.Wait, so the maximum value is 0? That seems interesting. Let me verify this with a quick check. If x = 0, then yes, it&#39;s 0. If x = 1, f(1) = ln(2) - 1 ≈ 0.6931 - 1 ≈ -0.3069. If x = -0.5, which is approaching -1, f(-0.5) = ln(0.5) - (-0.5) = -0.6931 + 0.5 ≈ -0.1931, which is still less than 0. So indeed, the maximum value is 0 at x = 0. That makes sense because the function starts at x approaching -1 from the right going to negative infinity, reaches 0 at x = 0, and then decreases again towards negative infinity as x increases. So part I&#39;s answer is 0.Part II: Proving 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a+b)/2) &lt; (b - a) ln 2 for 0 &lt; a &lt; bAlright, this part seems more involved. The function g(x) is x ln x. Let&#39;s first write out what g(a) + g(b) - 2g((a+b)/2) is:So, that&#39;s a ln a + b ln b - 2*( (a+b)/2 ) * ln( (a + b)/2 )Simplify the expression:First, 2 * [ (a + b)/2 * ln( (a + b)/2 ) ] = (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )Therefore, the expression becomes:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )So, we need to show that this is greater than 0 and less than (b - a) ln 2, given 0 &lt; a &lt; b.Let me think. The expression a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 ) resembles something related to entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, but maybe that&#39;s overcomplicating. Alternatively, it could be related to convexity.Wait, the function g(x) = x ln x. Let&#39;s check its convexity. The second derivative of g(x) is important for convexity. Let&#39;s compute:First derivative g&#39;(x) = ln x + 1.Second derivative g&#39;&#39;(x) = 1/x.Since x &gt; 0 (given 0 &lt; a &lt; b), the second derivative is positive. Therefore, g(x) is convex on its domain.Therefore, by Jensen&#39;s inequality, for a convex function, we have:g(a) + g(b) &gt;= 2g( (a + b)/2 )But wait, in our case, the expression is g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ), so if the inequality is &gt;= 0, then our expression is &gt;= 0, which matches the left side of the inequality we need to prove: 0 &lt; ... So the question is to show that this expression is strictly greater than 0 and less than (b - a) ln 2.But since the function is strictly convex (since the second derivative is positive), Jensen&#39;s inequality tells us that the inequality is strict unless a = b. Since we have 0 &lt; a &lt; b, so a ≠ b, therefore, g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) &gt; 0. That gives the left inequality.Now, for the right inequality: showing that this expression is less than (b - a) ln 2.Hmm. How to approach this?Perhaps expanding the expression and trying to manipulate it into a form that can be compared to (b - a) ln 2.Alternatively, maybe using the Mean Value Theorem or Taylor series expansion. Let&#39;s think.Let me denote c = (a + b)/2. Then, the expression becomes:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln c.But c is (a + b)/2. So, a + b = 2c. Therefore, we can write the expression as:a ln a + b ln b - 2c ln cBut since c is the midpoint, maybe we can write a = c - d and b = c + d, where d = (b - a)/2. Then, a = c - d and b = c + d, with d &gt; 0 since a &lt; b.Substituting:(c - d) ln(c - d) + (c + d) ln(c + d) - 2c ln cLet&#39;s compute this:= c ln(c - d) - d ln(c - d) + c ln(c + d) + d ln(c + d) - 2c ln cGroup the terms:= c [ ln(c - d) + ln(c + d) ] + d [ - ln(c - d) + ln(c + d) ] - 2c ln cSimplify:First term: c ln[(c - d)(c + d)] = c ln(c² - d²)Second term: d [ ln(c + d) - ln(c - d) ] = d ln( (c + d)/(c - d) )Third term: -2c ln cTherefore, the entire expression becomes:c ln(c² - d²) + d ln( (c + d)/(c - d) ) - 2c ln cFactor c in the first and third terms:= c [ ln(c² - d²) - 2 ln c ] + d ln( (c + d)/(c - d) )Simplify ln(c² - d²) - 2 ln c:= ln(c² - d²) - ln c² = ln( (c² - d²)/c² ) = ln(1 - (d²/c²))Therefore, the expression is:c ln(1 - (d²/c²)) + d ln( (c + d)/(c - d) )Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let&#39;s see if we can make progress.Alternatively, perhaps expanding in terms of d. Since d = (b - a)/2, and we need to relate this to (b - a) ln 2. The upper bound is (b - a) ln 2, so if we can show that the expression is less than 2d ln 2 (since d = (b - a)/2, so 2d = b - a), that would do.So maybe the transformed expression is:Expression = c ln(1 - (d²/c²)) + d ln( (c + d)/(c - d) )We need to show that this is less than 2d ln 2.Hmm. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe using the convexity of g(x) and some other inequality. Since g is convex, the difference g(a) + g(b) - 2g(c) (where c is the midpoint) is related to the squared difference or something. But the upper bound is given in terms of (b - a) ln 2. Maybe there&#39;s a way to bound this expression.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the function h(t) = g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) where t = b - a. But not sure.Wait, another approach: Let&#39;s define the expression as:E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )We can factor out (a + b):E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) [ ln(a + b) - ln 2 ]= a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b) + (a + b) ln 2So, E = [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] + (a + b) ln 2But the term [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] is equal to (a + b) [ (a/(a + b)) ln a + (b/(a + b)) ln b - ln(a + b) ]Which is similar to the negative of the entropy function, but maybe that&#39;s a stretch.Alternatively, we can consider the term:E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 ) = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b)(ln(a + b) - ln 2 )= a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b) + (a + b) ln 2So, E = [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] + (a + b) ln 2But perhaps we can rearrange:E = (a + b) ln 2 + [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)]But how does this help? Let&#39;s see. Maybe analyze the term in the brackets:a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)Let me set t = a/(a + b). Then, since 0 &lt; a &lt; b, t &lt; 1/2 (because a &lt; b, so a/(a + b) &lt; b/(a + b), and since a + b is fixed, t &lt; 1 - t).Wait, but t = a/(a + b), so 1 - t = b/(a + b). Then, the term becomes:(a + b)[ t ln(a) + (1 - t) ln(b) ] - (a + b) ln(a + b)= (a + b)[ t ln(a) + (1 - t) ln(b) - ln(a + b) ]= (a + b)[ t ln(a) + (1 - t) ln(b) - ln(a + b) ]But t = a/(a + b), so t ln(a) = (a/(a + b)) ln(a), similarly for the other term. So:= (a + b)[ (a/(a + b) ln a + b/(a + b) ln b ) - ln(a + b) ]= (a + b)[ ( (a ln a + b ln b)/(a + b) ) - ln(a + b) ]= (a ln a + b ln b) - (a + b) ln(a + b)Which is what we started with.Hmm, so this term is known in information theory as the negative of the joint entropy or something similar. But maybe it&#39;s better to see if we can bound this.Alternatively, note that:The term [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] is equivalent to:a ln (a / (a + b)) + b ln (b / (a + b))Which is equal to - (a + b) [ (a/(a + b)) ln( (a + b)/a ) + (b/(a + b)) ln( (a + b)/b ) ]Which is the negative of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution (a/(a + b), b/(a + b)) and the uniform distribution (1/2, 1/2), but scaled by (a + b). Hmm, perhaps not helpful here.Alternatively, let&#39;s think of the expression E:E = (a + b) ln 2 + [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)]But I need to show that E &lt; (b - a) ln 2.Wait, but (a + b) ln 2 is larger than (b - a) ln 2 because a + b &gt; b - a (since a and b are positive and a &lt; b). So perhaps this approach is not directly helpful.Wait, perhaps I made an error in the previous steps. Let&#39;s check again.Original expression:E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )We need to show that E &lt; (b - a) ln 2.Let me try to manipulate E:E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) [ ln(a + b) - ln 2 ]= a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b) + (a + b) ln 2So E = [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] + (a + b) ln 2But we need to show this is less than (b - a) ln 2. So:[a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] + (a + b) ln 2 &lt; (b - a) ln 2Subtract (a + b) ln 2 from both sides:[a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln(a + b)] &lt; -2a ln 2Wait, that seems tricky. Maybe not the right way.Alternative idea: Let&#39;s consider the difference between the upper bound and E:(b - a) ln 2 - [a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )]We need to show that this difference is positive.So compute:(b - a) ln 2 - a ln a - b ln b + (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 )Let me rearrange terms:= (a + b) ln( (a + b)/2 ) - a ln a - b ln b + (b - a) ln 2But not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor terms:= a [ ln( (a + b)/2 ) - ln a ] + b [ ln( (a + b)/2 ) - ln b ] + (b - a) ln 2= a ln( (a + b)/(2a) ) + b ln( (a + b)/(2b) ) + (b - a) ln 2= a ln( (1 + b/a)/2 ) + b ln( (a/b + 1)/2 ) + (b - a) ln 2Let me set t = b/a, where t &gt; 1 since b &gt; a &gt; 0.Then, substituting b = a t:= a ln( (1 + t)/2 ) + a t ln( (1/t + 1)/2 ) + (a t - a) ln 2Factor out a:= a [ ln( (1 + t)/2 ) + t ln( (1 + 1/t)/2 ) + (t - 1) ln 2 ]Simplify the second logarithm:(1 + 1/t)/2 = (t + 1)/(2t)So,ln( (t + 1)/(2t) ) = ln(t + 1) - ln(2t) = ln(t + 1) - ln 2 - ln tTherefore, substitute back into the expression:= a [ ln( (1 + t)/2 ) + t ( ln(t + 1) - ln 2 - ln t ) + (t - 1) ln 2 ]Now expand the terms:First term: ln( (1 + t)/2 ) = ln(1 + t) - ln 2Second term: t [ ln(t + 1) - ln 2 - ln t ] = t ln(t + 1) - t ln 2 - t ln tThird term: (t - 1) ln 2So putting all together:= a [ (ln(1 + t) - ln 2) + (t ln(t + 1) - t ln 2 - t ln t) + (t - 1) ln 2 ]Now, let&#39;s combine like terms:- Terms with ln(1 + t): ln(1 + t) + t ln(1 + t) = (1 + t) ln(1 + t)- Terms with ln 2: -ln 2 - t ln 2 + (t - 1) ln 2 = (-1 - t + t -1) ln 2 = (-2) ln 2Wait, let&#39;s compute:First ln 2 terms:Original expression has:- ln 2 (from first term)- t ln 2 (subtracted in the second term)+ (t -1) ln 2 (third term)So total ln 2 terms:(-1 - t + t -1) ln 2 = (-2) ln 2- Terms with ln t: -t ln tSo the entire expression becomes:= a [ (1 + t) ln(1 + t) - 2 ln 2 - t ln t ]Therefore, we have:(b - a) ln 2 - E = a [ (1 + t) ln(1 + t) - t ln t - 2 ln 2 ]We need to show that this is positive. Since a &gt; 0, it&#39;s equivalent to showing that:(1 + t) ln(1 + t) - t ln t - 2 ln 2 &gt; 0 for t &gt; 1.Let me define a function h(t) = (1 + t) ln(1 + t) - t ln t - 2 ln 2.We need to show h(t) &gt; 0 for t &gt; 1.Compute h(1):h(1) = 2 ln 2 - 1 ln 1 - 2 ln 2 = 2 ln 2 - 0 - 2 ln 2 = 0.Compute the derivative h&#39;(t):h&#39;(t) = d/dt [ (1 + t) ln(1 + t) - t ln t - 2 ln 2 ]First term derivative: ln(1 + t) + (1 + t)*(1/(1 + t)) = ln(1 + t) + 1Second term derivative: - [ ln t + t*(1/t) ] = - ln t - 1Third term derivative: 0Therefore, h&#39;(t) = ln(1 + t) + 1 - ln t - 1 = ln( (1 + t)/t ) = ln(1 + 1/t )Since t &gt; 1, 1/t &lt; 1, so 1 + 1/t &gt; 1, so ln(1 + 1/t ) &gt; 0. Therefore, h&#39;(t) &gt; 0 for t &gt; 1.Since h(1) = 0 and h&#39;(t) &gt; 0 for t &gt; 1, then h(t) is increasing for t &gt; 1 and h(t) &gt; h(1) = 0 for t &gt; 1. Therefore, h(t) &gt; 0 for t &gt; 1. Therefore, (b - a) ln 2 - E &gt; 0, which implies E &lt; (b - a) ln 2. Thus, the right inequality is proved.Therefore, combining both parts, we have 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2g( (a + b)/2 ) &lt; (b - a) ln 2.SummaryFor part I, the maximum of f(x) = ln(1+x) - x occurs at x = 0 with value 0. For part II, using substitution and convexity along with analyzing the function h(t) shows the required inequality.Final Answer(I) The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{0}).(II) The inequality ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) is proven as required.&lt;/think&gt;(I) To find the maximum value of the function ( f(x) = ln(1+x) - x ):1. Compute the first derivative: ( f&#39;(x) = frac{1}{1+x} - 1 ).2. Set the derivative equal to zero: ( frac{1}{1+x} - 1 = 0 ). Solving this gives ( x = 0 ).3. Compute the second derivative: ( f&#39;&#39;(x) = -frac{1}{(1+x)^2} ). Evaluating at ( x = 0 ) gives ( f&#39;&#39;(0) = -1 ), which is negative, indicating a local maximum.4. Check the behavior of ( f(x) ) as ( x to -1^+ ) and ( x to infty ), both approaching ( -infty ). Thus, the maximum value is at ( x = 0 ).The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is ( f(0) = ln(1) - 0 = 0 ).[boxed{0}](II) To prove ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) for ( 0 &lt; a &lt; b ):1. The function ( g(x) = x ln x ) is convex since its second derivative ( g&#39;&#39;(x) = frac{1}{x} ) is positive for ( x &gt; 0 ).2. By Jensen&#39;s inequality for strictly convex functions, ( g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &gt; 0 ).3. To show the upper bound, consider the expression ( E = a ln a + b ln b - (a + b) lnleft(frac{a + b}{2}right) ).4. Substitute ( t = frac{b}{a} ) (where ( t &gt; 1 )) and transform the expression to show it is less than ( (b - a)ln 2 ).5. Define ( h(t) = (1 + t) ln(1 + t) - t ln t - 2 ln 2 ) and show ( h(t) &gt; 0 ) for ( t &gt; 1 ). The derivative ( h&#39;(t) = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{t}right) ) is positive, indicating ( h(t) ) is increasing and positive for ( t &gt; 1 ).Thus, the inequality ( 0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2 ) is proven.[boxed{0 &lt; g(a) + g(b) - 2gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) &lt; (b - a)ln 2}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🔑:</span>(I) Solution: The domain of the function f(x) is (-1,+infty).f&#39;(x)=frac{1}{1+x}-1.

Alright, let&#39;s start by recalling that if two sets are equal, all their elements must be the same, though the order doesn&#39;t matter. So, each element in A must be in B and vice versa. The sets are A = {x, y/x, 1} and B = {x², x + y, 0}. Hmm, so I need to figure out the values of x and y that make these sets equal.First, let&#39;s list the elements of both sets. Set A has three elements: x, y/x, and 1. Set B has x², x + y, and 0. Since sets don&#39;t have duplicate elements, all these elements must be distinct. So, all elements in A must be present in B, and all elements in B must be present in A. The challenge here is to figure out which elements correspond to each other because the order doesn&#39;t matter.One of the elements in B is 0, which means that 0 must be an element of A as well. So, either x = 0, y/x = 0, or 1 = 0. But 1 can&#39;t be 0, so that&#39;s out. Let&#39;s check the other possibilities.If x = 0, then in set A, we would have 0, y/0 (which is undefined), and 1. But division by zero isn&#39;t allowed, so x can&#39;t be 0. Therefore, the other possibility is that y/x = 0. If y/x = 0, then y must be 0 (since a fraction is 0 when the numerator is 0 and the denominator isn&#39;t). So, if y = 0, then let&#39;s see what happens.If y = 0, then set A becomes {x, 0, 1} and set B becomes {x², x, 0} (since x + y = x + 0 = x). Now, comparing these sets: A has {x, 0, 1}, and B has {x², x, 0}. For these to be equal, the remaining element in A that&#39;s not in B must be 1, and in B, the remaining element not in A must be x². So, this implies that x² must equal 1. Therefore, x² = 1, which means x = 1 or x = -1.Let&#39;s check both possibilities.First, if x = 1. Then set A is {1, 0, 1}, but wait, that would have duplicates: 1 appears twice. However, sets cannot have duplicate elements, so this would actually be {0, 1}. But the original set A was given as {x, y/x, 1}, which should have three distinct elements. However, if x = 1 and y = 0, then y/x = 0, so set A is {1, 0, 1}, but this collapses to {0, 1}, which has only two elements. But the original set B is {x², x, 0}, which when x = 1 is {1, 1, 0}, which also collapses to {0, 1}. So, both sets would have only two elements, but the problem states them as sets with three elements. Therefore, x = 1 is invalid because it leads to duplicate elements, which aren&#39;t allowed in sets. So, x = 1 is not a valid solution.Next, if x = -1. Then set A becomes {-1, 0/(-1), 1}, which simplifies to {-1, 0, 1} because 0 divided by -1 is 0. Set B becomes {(-1)^2, -1 + 0, 0} which is {1, -1, 0}. So, set A is {-1, 0, 1} and set B is {1, -1, 0}. These are the same sets, just written in different orders. So, this works. Therefore, x = -1 and y = 0 is a valid solution.Wait, but let me confirm. If x = -1 and y = 0, then set A is {-1, 0, 1} and set B is {1, -1, 0}, which are indeed equal. So, that&#39;s good. So, x = -1 and y = 0 is a valid solution. Therefore, these are the values we need.Alternatively, let&#39;s check if there might be other solutions. Let me think. Suppose that 0 isn&#39;t coming from y/x but from another element. Wait, but set B has 0, so set A must have 0. The elements of A are x, y/x, and 1. Since 1 can&#39;t be 0, and x can&#39;t be 0 (as we saw earlier because then y/x is undefined), the only way for A to have 0 is if y/x = 0, which requires y = 0. So, that seems like the only path. So, the only possible solution is y = 0, and then x² must be 1. But x can&#39;t be 1 because that would cause duplicates, so x must be -1. Therefore, x = -1 and y = 0 is the only solution.So, now, we need to compute x^2023 + y^2024. Plugging in x = -1 and y = 0:First, (-1)^2023. Since 2023 is an odd number, (-1) raised to an odd power is -1. So, (-1)^2023 = -1.Next, y^2024 = 0^2024. Any number to any power is 0, so 0^2024 = 0.Therefore, adding them together: -1 + 0 = -1.So, the answer should be -1. But let me double-check everything to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.Starting again: A = B implies that all elements in A are in B and vice versa. Set A has x, y/x, 1. Set B has x², x + y, 0. So, 0 must be in A, which as we saw requires y = 0. Then set A becomes {x, 0, 1}, set B becomes {x², x, 0}. Therefore, the elements x, 0, 1 must equal x², x, 0. Therefore, x² must be equal to 1. So, x = 1 or x = -1. But x = 1 causes duplication in the set, so it&#39;s invalid. Therefore, x = -1. Then y = 0. So, x = -1, y = 0. Therefore, the calculation is correct.Alternatively, could there be another scenario where 0 is not obtained from y/x? For instance, maybe x is 0? But earlier, we saw that x can&#39;t be 0 because y/x would be undefined. So, no. Therefore, the only solution is x = -1, y = 0. Therefore, the answer is -1 + 0 = -1.Yes, that seems right. I think that&#39;s the correct answer.Final Answerboxed{-1}&lt;/think&gt;Given sets ( A = {x, frac{y}{x}, 1} ) and ( B = {x^2, x + y, 0} ), we need to find ( x^{2023} + y^{2024} ) if ( A = B ).Since sets ( A ) and ( B ) must have the same elements, we start by noting that ( 0 ) must be an element of ( A ). The elements of ( A ) are ( x ), ( frac{y}{x} ), and ( 1 ). Since ( 1 neq 0 ) and ( x ) cannot be ( 0 ) (as it would make ( frac{y}{x} ) undefined), the only possibility is ( frac{y}{x} = 0 ). This implies ( y = 0 ).With ( y = 0 ), set ( A ) becomes ( {x, 0, 1} ) and set ( B ) becomes ( {x^2, x, 0} ). For these sets to be equal, the remaining elements must match. Thus, ( x^2 ) must be equal to ( 1 ), leading to ( x = 1 ) or ( x = -1 ).- If ( x = 1 ), set ( A ) would be ( {1, 0, 1} ), which is invalid due to duplicate elements.- If ( x = -1 ), set ( A ) becomes ( {-1, 0, 1} ) and set ( B ) becomes ( {1, -1, 0} ), which are valid and equal.Thus, ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 0 ). Calculating ( x^{2023} + y^{2024} ):- ( (-1)^{2023} = -1 ) (since 2023 is odd)- ( 0^{2024} = 0 )Therefore, ( x^{2023} + y^{2024} = -1 + 0 = -1 ).[boxed{-1}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I have two sets, A and B. A is {x, y/x, 1} and B is {x², x + y, 0}. And they&#39;re equal. So, since sets are equal, all elements of A must be in B and vice versa. Also, sets don&#39;t have duplicate elements, so all elements must be unique. Hmm, so I need to find x and y such that every element in A is in B and every element in B is in A.First, let&#39;s list the elements of A and B:A = {x, y/x, 1}B = {x², x + y, 0}Since sets are unordered, the order doesn&#39;t matter, but the elements must match. So, each element in A must be equal to one element in B. Also, since sets have unique elements, there can&#39;t be duplicates. So, x, y/x, and 1 must all be distinct, and x², x + y, 0 must all be distinct as well.So, first, let&#39;s note that 0 is in set B. Therefore, 0 must be in set A as well. So, one of the elements in A (x, y/x, 1) must be 0. Let&#39;s check which one can be 0.Looking at A: elements are x, y/x, and 1. 1 is already 1, so that can&#39;t be 0. So either x = 0 or y/x = 0.But if x = 0, then y/x would be undefined (division by zero). So x can&#39;t be 0. Therefore, the only possibility is that y/x = 0. If y/x = 0, then y must be 0 (since x ≠ 0). So y = 0.So from this, we can conclude that y = 0. Let&#39;s write that down: y = 0.Now, substitute y = 0 into both sets:A becomes {x, 0/x, 1} which simplifies to {x, 0, 1} (since 0 divided by x is 0 as long as x ≠ 0, which we already know because y/x was an element of A and x can&#39;t be 0).Set B becomes {x², x + 0, 0} which simplifies to {x², x, 0}.So now, A = {x, 0, 1} and B = {x², x, 0}. Since A and B must be equal, their elements must match. So the elements in A are x, 0, 1 and the elements in B are x², x, 0. Therefore, the element 1 in A must be equal to the element in B which is not x or 0. That element is x². So x² must equal 1.Therefore, x² = 1. Solving this, x can be 1 or -1.So two possibilities for x: x = 1 or x = -1. Let&#39;s check both possibilities.First, let&#39;s check x = 1.If x = 1, then set A is {1, 0, 1}, but wait, that would have duplicate elements (two 1s). But sets cannot have duplicates, so this is invalid. Therefore, x cannot be 1.Wait, but in set A, when x = 1, the elements would be 1, 0, and 1. Since sets must have unique elements, having two 1s is not allowed. Therefore, x = 1 is not possible. So x must be -1.Let&#39;s check x = -1.If x = -1, then set A is {-1, 0, 1}, because y is 0. Let&#39;s verify set B. Set B would be {(-1)², -1 + 0, 0} which is {1, -1, 0}. So set B is {1, -1, 0}, which is the same as set A. Since sets are unordered, { -1, 0, 1 } is the same as { 1, -1, 0 }, so this works.Therefore, x = -1 and y = 0.Now, the question asks for x²⁰²³ + y²⁰²⁴. Let&#39;s compute that.First, x = -1. So (-1)²⁰²³. Since 2023 is an odd exponent, (-1) raised to an odd power is -1.Then y = 0. So 0²⁰²⁴ is 0.Therefore, x²⁰²³ + y²⁰²⁴ = (-1) + 0 = -1.Wait, but the problem might expect the answer in boxed notation. Let me just double-check my steps.1. A = B implies they have the same elements.2. Since 0 is in B, it must be in A. Therefore, either x, y/x, or 1 is 0. 1 can&#39;t be 0. x can&#39;t be 0 because y/x would be undefined. So y/x = 0 =&gt; y = 0.3. Then A becomes {x, 0, 1} and B becomes {x², x, 0}.4. Comparing these, the extra element in A is 1, so in B, the element corresponding to 1 must be x². Hence, x² = 1.5. Solutions x = 1 or x = -1. But x = 1 leads to duplicate elements in set A, which is invalid. So x = -1.6. Therefore, x = -1, y = 0. Then x²⁰²³ + y²⁰²⁴ = (-1)^2023 + 0^2024 = (-1) + 0 = -1.Yes, that seems right. Let me check once more if there are other possibilities. For example, could there be another way where elements map differently?Suppose we tried to map 1 to x + y instead of x². But if x + y = 1, then since y = 0, x = 1. But as before, x = 1 leads to duplicate elements in set A. So that&#39;s not possible. Hence, the only valid mapping is x² = 1, leading to x = -1. Therefore, the answer is -1.Final Answerboxed{-1}&lt;/think&gt;Given sets ( A = {x, frac{y}{x}, 1} ) and ( B = {x^2, x + y, 0} ), we need to find ( x^{2023} + y^{2024} ) if ( A = B ).1. Since ( 0 ) is an element of set ( B ), it must also be an element of set ( A ). The elements of ( A ) are ( x ), ( frac{y}{x} ), and ( 1 ). Since ( 1 ) cannot be ( 0 ) and ( x ) cannot be ( 0 ) (as it would make ( frac{y}{x} ) undefined), we conclude ( frac{y}{x} = 0 ). This implies ( y = 0 ).2. Substituting ( y = 0 ) into both sets:   - Set ( A ) becomes ( {x, 0, 1} )   - Set ( B ) becomes ( {x^2, x, 0} )3. For sets ( A ) and ( B ) to be equal, the element ( 1 ) in ( A ) must correspond to an element in ( B ). The only possibility is ( x^2 = 1 ), giving ( x = 1 ) or ( x = -1 ).4. Checking ( x = 1 ):   - Set ( A ) would be ( {1, 0, 1} ), which has duplicate elements and is invalid.5. Checking ( x = -1 ):   - Set ( A ) becomes ( {-1, 0, 1} )   - Set ( B ) becomes ( {1, -1, 0} )   - Both sets are valid and equal.6. Therefore, ( x = -1 ) and ( y = 0 ).7. Calculating ( x^{2023} + y^{2024} ):   - ( (-1)^{2023} = -1 ) (since 2023 is odd)   - ( 0^{2024} = 0 )Thus, the final answer is (boxed{-1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🔑:</span>Given A={x,frac{y}{x},1} and B={{x}^{2},x+y,0} and the condition that A=B, we proceed as follows:1.

This gives us the equations:   - 1 = {x}^{2} or 1 = x+y or 1 = 0   - x = {x}^{2} or x = x+y or x = 0   - frac{y}{x} = {x}^{2} or frac{y}{x} = x+y or frac{y}{x} = 02. From the possible matches, we observe that 1 = 0 is impossible, and hence 1 = {x}^{2} and 0 must match with either x or frac{y}{x}. Since x = 0 would not satisfy x^2 = 1, it follows that 0 = frac{y}{x}, leading to y = 0.3. With y = 0, the equation 1 = {x}^{2} becomes our focus. Considering x could be either 1 or -1 to satisfy this equation.4.

I have this problem about an isosceles trapezoid ABCD where the three sides AB, BC, and CD are tangent to the parabola y = -1/2 x² + 2. The task is to find the minimum area of this trapezoid. Hmm, okay. First, I need to visualize this. The parabola is given by y = -½x² + 2, which is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0, 2). The domain is x ∈ [-2, 2], so the parabola spans from x = -2 to x = 2. At x = ±2, the y-value is -½*(4) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. So the parabola has its vertex at (0, 2) and intersects the x-axis at (-2, 0) and (2, 0).Now, the trapezoid ABCD is isosceles, which means the non-parallel sides (the legs) are equal in length, and the base angles are equal. In an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent, and the upper base is shorter than the lower base. However, in this problem, three sides are tangent to the parabola: AB, BC, and CD. Since ABCD is a trapezoid, sides AB and CD are the two bases (the parallel sides), and BC and AD are the legs. Wait, but the problem says AB, BC, and CD are tangent. So the two bases AB and CD, and one of the legs BC, are tangent to the parabola. The other leg, AD, is not necessarily tangent. Hmm, interesting.Wait, but the trapezoid is isosceles, so if BC is tangent, then AD should also be tangent? Because in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and symmetric. So if BC is tangent, maybe AD is also tangent? But the problem states that only AB, BC, and CD are tangent. So maybe AD is not tangent? That seems odd. Let me confirm: the problem says &quot;the three sides AB, BC, and CD are tangent&quot;. So three sides, not all four. So AB, BC, CD are tangent, but AD is not. Hmm. So ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with AB, BC, CD tangent to the parabola. The area of this trapezoid needs to be minimized.First, perhaps I need to model the trapezoid. Since it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, it&#39;s symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So the left and right sides (legs) are symmetric. Let&#39;s assume that the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis. So points A and D are on the left and right sides, respectively, and points B and C are on the right and left? Wait, need to clarify.Wait, trapezoid ABCD. Let&#39;s recall the order of the vertices in a trapezoid. Typically, ABCD would be labeled such that AB and CD are the two bases, and BC and AD are the legs. So if it&#39;s isosceles, legs BC and AD are congruent. But since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are congruent and symmetric with respect to the vertical axis (if the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis). So, given that the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that the trapezoid is also symmetric about the y-axis.Therefore, points A and D are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, as are points B and C. So, if AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base, then AB would be horizontal, as would CD. But the problem doesn&#39;t specify which sides are the bases. Wait, in an isosceles trapezoid, the bases are the two parallel sides. So if AB, BC, CD are the three sides tangent to the parabola, then perhaps AB and CD are the two bases (parallel sides), and BC is one of the legs? But in that case, BC would be a leg, not a base. Wait, maybe I need to check the problem statement again.Wait, the problem says: &quot;the three sides AB, BC, and CD of the isosceles trapezoid ABCD are tangent to the graph...&quot;. So AB, BC, CD are three consecutive sides of the trapezoid. In a trapezoid, consecutive sides are two bases and a leg. Wait, for example, ABCD with AB and CD being the two bases (parallel), and BC and AD the legs. So the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB, BC, CD are three consecutive sides. Therefore, AB and CD are the two bases (parallel sides), and BC is a leg. But in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and non-parallel. So BC and AD are the legs. Therefore, if AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola, then AB and CD are the top and bottom bases, BC is one leg, and the other leg AD is not tangent. Hmm. That&#39;s possible.But since the trapezoid is isosceles, and the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, maybe the trapezoid is also symmetric, so if BC is tangent to the parabola on one side, then AD is also tangent on the other. But the problem only states that AB, BC, CD are tangent, so perhaps AD is not. But maybe the problem counts BC and AD as the same because of symmetry? Wait, no. The sides AB, BC, CD are specified. So AB is the top base, BC is the right leg, CD is the bottom base? Wait, but CD is a base, so it&#39;s parallel to AB. But in a trapezoid, the two bases are the two parallel sides. So if AB and CD are the bases (parallel), then BC is a leg. So AB, BC, CD are three sides: AB is a base, BC is a leg, CD is a base. Then DA is the other leg. So if AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola, DA is not. But since the trapezoid is isosceles, DA is congruent to BC, but not tangent. However, given the symmetry, perhaps BC and DA are both tangent, but the problem says only three sides. Hmm, maybe there&#39;s a misinterpretation here.Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is oriented such that AB and CD are the legs, and BC and AD are the bases? Wait, but in a trapezoid, only two sides are parallel. So if AB and CD are legs, then BC and AD would be the bases. But if AB and CD are legs, then BC and AD are the bases. But in that case, AB and CD being legs would be non-parallel, and BC and AD would be the two bases (parallel sides). However, the problem says the trapezoid is isosceles, which typically refers to the legs being congruent. So perhaps AB and CD are the legs, and BC and AD are the bases. Then AB and CD are congruent and non-parallel, and BC and AD are the bases (parallel). But in that case, the sides AB, BC, CD would be three consecutive sides: AB (leg), BC (base), CD (leg). But that would mean BC is a base, so parallel to AD. Then AB and CD are legs, which are non-parallel. But the problem states that three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent. If AB and CD are legs, BC is a base. Then perhaps BC is the lower base, AB is the left leg, CD is the right leg, and AD is the upper base. But in that case, AB and CD are legs, BC and AD are the bases.But this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to draw a rough sketch mentally. The parabola is opening downward with vertex at (0,2) and x-intercepts at (-2,0) and (2,0). The trapezoid is isosceles, so symmetric about the y-axis. Let&#39;s suppose that the trapezoid is such that the upper base AB is above the parabola, the lower base CD is below the parabola? Wait, but the parabola is between y=0 and y=2. Wait, the parabola goes from y=0 at x=±2 up to y=2 at x=0. So if the trapezoid has sides AB, BC, CD tangent to the parabola, then these sides must touch the parabola at points P, Q, R. Since the parabola is between x=-2 and x=2, the trapezoid must be within or around this region.Given that the trapezoid is tangent to the parabola at three points, the sides AB, BC, CD each touch the parabola at one point. Let&#39;s consider the trapezoid is surrounding the parabola. Since it&#39;s symmetric, the trapezoid must be symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, the points of tangency P, Q, R should also be symmetric. Wait, but there are three points. So maybe the tangency points are symmetric with Q at the center (on the y-axis) and P, R symmetric about the y-axis. For example, Q is at the vertex (0,2), but the vertex is the highest point. Wait, but if BC is a leg, and it&#39;s tangent at Q, which might be at the vertex. But the vertex is at (0,2). However, if AB and CD are the bases, they might be horizontal lines tangent to the parabola at points symmetric about the y-axis. For example, AB is a horizontal line above the parabola, tangent at some point (a, -½a² + 2) and (-a, -½a² + 2), but since AB is a single side, it&#39;s a line segment. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the bases are the two parallel sides. If AB and CD are the bases, then AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base. If AB is tangent to the parabola at two points (symmetric), but the problem says each side is tangent at one point. Wait, the problem states that AB, BC, CD are tangent at points P, Q, R. So each side is tangent at one point. Therefore, AB is tangent at one point P, BC at Q, CD at R.Therefore, each of these sides is a tangent line to the parabola at exactly one point. Since the parabola is a function, vertical lines can&#39;t be tangent, so all tangent lines are non-vertical. So sides AB, BC, CD are each tangent lines to the parabola at one point each. Since the trapezoid is isosceles and symmetric about the y-axis, the points of tangency for AB and CD should be symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and the point of tangency for BC should be on the y-axis. Similarly, if BC is a leg, then BC is a non-parallel side, and since the trapezoid is symmetric, BC is on the right side, and AD is on the left side. But BC is tangent at Q, which is on the y-axis. So BC is the right leg, tangent to the parabola at the vertex (0, 2). Wait, but the vertex is (0,2). The slope of the tangent at the vertex (0,2) is horizontal? Let&#39;s check. The derivative of y = -½x² + 2 is y’ = -x. At x=0, the slope is 0, so the tangent is horizontal. Therefore, the tangent line at (0,2) is horizontal. If BC is tangent at (0,2), and BC is a leg of the trapezoid, which is a non-parallel side, but if BC is horizontal, then BC would be a base, not a leg. That contradicts, since in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. Therefore, maybe BC is not tangent at the vertex.Wait, perhaps the point Q is not the vertex. Let&#39;s think again. Let&#39;s denote the points of tangency: P on AB, Q on BC, R on CD. Given the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, then points P and R should be symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and point Q is on the y-axis. Therefore, Q is at (0, b) for some b. Let&#39;s formalize this.Let me denote the coordinates. Let’s assume the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis. Let’s denote the top base AB as a horizontal line segment tangent to the parabola at point P (p, -½p² + 2) and its symmetric counterpart. Wait, but AB is a single side, so if it&#39;s horizontal and tangent to the parabola, then the tangent point must be unique? Wait, no. A horizontal line can be tangent to the parabola at one point. Since the parabola is symmetric, a horizontal line will be tangent at one point if it&#39;s above the vertex, but wait, the parabola opens downward. The vertex is at (0,2). A horizontal line above y=2 would not intersect the parabola. A horizontal line at y=2 is tangent at the vertex. Lines below y=2 will intersect the parabola at two points. Therefore, the only horizontal tangent line is at y=2, tangent at (0,2). Therefore, if AB is a horizontal tangent, it must be the line y=2, tangent at (0,2). But then AB would be the line y=2 from (-a, 2) to (a, 2), but that line is only tangent at (0,2). Wait, but the line y=2 is horizontal and touches the parabola only at (0,2). So AB could be the line y=2, but then AB is the top base of the trapezoid. Then BC would be the right leg, going from (a,2) down to some point (c, d), and CD would be the bottom base from (c, d) to (-c, d). But CD would then be another horizontal line. Wait, but CD is supposed to be tangent to the parabola as well. If CD is a horizontal line, it can only be tangent at a single point. If CD is below y=2, then a horizontal line would intersect the parabola at two points unless it&#39;s at y=0, which is the x-axis. The x-axis is tangent to the parabola at (2,0) and (-2,0). Wait, but the x-axis is the line y=0, which touches the parabola at x=±2, which are endpoints. But the problem states that the parabola is considered for x ∈ [-2, 2]. So at x=±2, the parabola meets the x-axis. But the x-axis is tangent to the parabola at those points? Let&#39;s check. The derivative at x=2 is y’ = -x = -2, so the slope at (2,0) is -2. The x-axis has slope 0, so it&#39;s not tangent at (2,0). Similarly, the tangent line at (2,0) is y = -2(x - 2) + 0 = -2x + 4. Similarly, at (-2, 0), the tangent line is y = 2x + 4. So the x-axis is not tangent to the parabola at those points. Therefore, there is no horizontal tangent line at y=0. Therefore, the only horizontal tangent line is y=2 at the vertex. Therefore, if AB and CD are horizontal lines tangent to the parabola, they must both be y=2, which would collapse the trapezoid into a line, which is impossible. Therefore, AB and CD cannot both be horizontal tangent lines. Therefore, maybe AB and CD are not horizontal? Wait, but in a trapezoid, the two bases are parallel. If they are not horizontal, they could be slanting, but since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are congruent and the non-parallel sides are symmetric. However, given the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, the two bases AB and CD must be horizontal. Because any non-horizontal parallel lines symmetric about the y-axis would require the trapezoid to be slanting, but isosceles trapezoids usually have horizontal bases. Wait, but maybe not necessarily. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let&#39;s try to approach step by step.First, the trapezoid is isosceles, symmetric about the y-axis. The three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates of the trapezoid. Let’s suppose that the top base AB is a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at some point P(p, -½p² + 2), and due to symmetry, there&#39;s another tangent point on the left side, but since AB is a single side, perhaps it&#39;s tangent at a single point. Wait, but a line can only be tangent to a parabola at one point. So AB is a tangent line to the parabola at point P(p, -½p² + 2). Similarly, CD is a tangent line at point R(r, -½r² + 2). Given the trapezoid is symmetric, then R should be (-p, -½p² + 2) if P is (p, ...). Wait, but if AB and CD are the two bases, then AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base. If the trapezoid is symmetric, then CD would be the reflection of AB over the x-axis? Not necessarily, because the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, not the x-axis. Hmm.Alternatively, since the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, then points A and D are on the left and right, respectively, and points B and C are on the right and left. Let me try to assign coordinates. Let’s assume that the top base AB is tangent to the parabola at point Q on the right side, BC is tangent at the vertex (0,2), and CD is tangent at point Q&#39; on the left side. Wait, but the problem states there are three tangent points: P, Q, R. So each side is tangent at one point. So AB is tangent at P, BC at Q, CD at R. Given symmetry, perhaps P and R are symmetric across the y-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So Q is at (0,2), the vertex. Let&#39;s check if BC can be tangent at (0,2). The tangent line at (0,2) is horizontal (slope 0). If BC is a leg of the trapezoid, which is supposed to be a non-parallel side, but if BC is horizontal, then it would be parallel to AB and CD, which contradicts the definition of a trapezoid (only two sides are parallel). Therefore, BC cannot be horizontal. Therefore, the tangent point Q cannot be at (0,2). Therefore, Q must be another point on the parabola where the tangent line is not horizontal.Therefore, let&#39;s denote:- AB is the top base, a line tangent to the parabola at point P(p, -½p² + 2).- BC is the right leg, a line tangent to the parabola at point Q(q, -½q² + 2).- CD is the bottom base, a line tangent to the parabola at point R(r, -½r² + 2).Given the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, then points P and R should be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, R is (-p, -½p² + 2). Similarly, the tangent line for AB is at point P(p, -½p² + 2), and the tangent line for CD is at R(-p, -½p² + 2). The tangent line for BC is at point Q, which, due to symmetry, should be on the y-axis. So Q is (0, q_y), but the parabola at x=0 is (0, 2), so Q must be (0,2). But as before, the tangent at (0,2) is horizontal, which would make BC a horizontal line, conflicting with BC being a leg. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. Maybe the trapezoid is not symmetric in the way I thought? Or perhaps the tangent points are not symmetric?Wait, the problem says it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. So if the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, legs BC and AD are congruent and symmetric. However, the problem states that three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent. So perhaps BC is the right leg, tangent at some point, and AD is the left leg, which is not tangent. But since the trapezoid is symmetric, if BC is tangent at some point (q_x, q_y), then AD should be tangent at (-q_x, q_y). But the problem only mentions three sides being tangent. Therefore, maybe the trapezoid is not symmetric? But it&#39;s stated to be isosceles, which usually implies symmetry. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, but the three tangent points are P, Q, R with Q on the y-axis, and P and R symmetric. So AB is the top base, tangent at P(p, y_p), BC is the right leg, tangent at Q(0, y_q), and CD is the bottom base, tangent at R(-p, y_p). Wait, but if AB and CD are the two bases, they must be parallel. If they are both tangent lines to the parabola at symmetric points, then their slopes should be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, unless they are horizontal. Wait, no. If AB and CD are parallel, their slopes must be equal. If AB is tangent at P(p, y_p), then its slope is the derivative at p, which is -p. Similarly, CD is tangent at R(-p, y_p), so the derivative at -p is p. Therefore, the slopes of AB and CD would be -p and p, which are negatives of each other, meaning AB and CD are not parallel unless p=0, which would make both slopes zero. But p=0 would mean AB and CD are both tangent at the vertex (0,2), but then AB and CD would both be the horizontal line y=2, which can&#39;t form a trapezoid. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, AB and CD cannot both be tangent lines to the parabola unless they are horizontal, which is only possible at the vertex. But that&#39;s not useful. Therefore, my previous assumption is wrong. Therefore, perhaps AB and CD are not both tangent. Wait, the problem says AB, BC, CD are tangent. So AB and CD are the two bases, each tangent to the parabola at one point, and BC is a leg tangent at one point. However, given that AB and CD are parallel, their tangent lines must have the same slope, but the parabola&#39;s tangent slopes at different points would only be equal if the points are symmetric. Wait, but the slope of the tangent at point x=a is -a. So if AB is tangent at x=p, slope is -p, and CD is tangent at x=q, slope is -q. For AB and CD to be parallel, their slopes must be equal, so -p = -q =&gt; p = q. But if the trapezoid is symmetric, then AB and CD are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so if AB is tangent at x=p, CD would be tangent at x=-p, giving slopes -p and p, which are not equal unless p=0. Therefore, the only way AB and CD can be parallel and tangent to the parabola is if they are both horizontal lines (slope 0), which occurs only at the vertex (0,2). But then AB and CD would both coincide at y=2, which is not possible. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, my initial approach must be flawed.Alternative approach: Maybe the trapezoid is not symmetric in the way I thought. Wait, but it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, which is defined as a trapezoid with legs congruent and base angles equal. This usually implies symmetry. So perhaps the trapezoid is symmetric about the vertical axis. Let&#39;s consider that AB and CD are the two bases, horizontal, and BC and AD are the legs, non-parallel, slanting inwards. However, three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. If AB and CD are horizontal lines tangent to the parabola, each at one point. Let&#39;s suppose AB is above the parabola, CD is below. Wait, but the parabola is between y=0 and y=2. If CD is below the parabola, it would have to be below y=0, which is outside the given parabola&#39;s range. Alternatively, CD could be above the parabola? But the parabola&#39;s highest point is y=2. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is surrounding the parabola. So AB is a horizontal line above the parabola, tangent at the vertex (0,2). Then BC is a line tangent to the parabola on the right side, and CD is a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at the bottom. Wait, but the bottom of the parabola is at y=0, which is the x-axis. So CD would be the x-axis, tangent at (2,0) and (-2,0). But the problem states that each side is tangent at one point. However, the x-axis intersects the parabola at two points, so it&#39;s not a tangent. So CD can&#39;t be the x-axis. Therefore, CD must be a line tangent somewhere else. Wait, but the parabola is only defined between x=-2 and x=2. So any tangent line to the parabola must touch it at exactly one point within this interval.Let me recall that a tangent line to the parabola y = -½x² + 2 at a point (a, -½a² + 2) has the equation derived as follows. The derivative is y’ = -x, so at x=a, the slope is -a. Therefore, the tangent line at point (a, -½a² + 2) is:y = -a(x - a) + (-½a² + 2) = -a x + a² - ½a² + 2 = -a x + (½a² + 2).So the equation is y = -a x + (½a² + 2).Similarly, the tangent line at point (-a, -½a² + 2) (since the parabola is symmetric) would have slope a, so equation:y = a(x + a) + (-½a² + 2) = a x + a² - ½a² + 2 = a x + (½a² + 2).Now, considering the trapezoid, let&#39;s suppose AB is the top base, a horizontal line tangent at the vertex (0,2). The equation of AB would then be y = 2, as the tangent at (0,2) is horizontal. Then BC is the right leg, tangent to the parabola at some point (a, -½a² + 2) where a &gt; 0. The equation of BC is y = -a x + (½a² + 2). Similarly, CD is the bottom base, which would need to be a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at some point. Wait, but the only horizontal tangent is y=2. If we want another horizontal line tangent to the parabola, it would have to be below y=2, but such a line would intersect the parabola at two points. Wait, no. For a horizontal line y = k to be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2, we set k = -½x² + 2. The horizontal line will touch the parabola at x=0 if k=2, which is the vertex. For other k values, the line y=k will intersect the parabola at two points when k &lt; 2 and no points when k &gt; 2. Therefore, the only horizontal tangent line is y=2. Therefore, CD cannot be a horizontal tangent line unless it&#39;s also y=2, which would make the trapezoid collapse. Therefore, CD must be a non-horizontal tangent line.Wait, but CD is supposed to be a base of the trapezoid, which is parallel to AB. Since AB is horizontal (y=2), CD must also be horizontal. But as established, the only horizontal tangent is y=2. Therefore, CD cannot be a horizontal tangent line. Contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that AB is the horizontal tangent at y=2 is invalid.Alternative approach: Maybe AB and CD are not horizontal. Then, since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two bases AB and CD are parallel but not horizontal. However, given the symmetry about the y-axis, the trapezoid would have AB and CD symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let’s consider that AB is a line tangent to the parabola at some point (a, -½a² + 2) and CD is tangent at (-a, -½a² + 2). Then, since AB and CD are parallel, their slopes must be equal. The slope of AB is -a (from derivative), and the slope of CD is a (derivative at -a). For them to be parallel, -a = a =&gt; a=0. But that again gives the horizontal line at y=2, leading to the same problem. Therefore, AB and CD cannot be parallel unless they are horizontal, which only allows y=2, which is not feasible. Therefore, this suggests that the initial assumption that AB and CD are the two bases (parallel sides) might be wrong. Maybe the trapezoid is such that BC and AD are the bases? But in a trapezoid, only two sides are parallel. If BC and AD are the bases (parallel), then AB and CD are the legs. But since the trapezoid is isosceles, legs AB and CD are congruent. However, the problem states that AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola, so two legs and one base. If BC is a base (parallel to AD), and AB and CD are legs, then BC and AD are the two bases.But then BC is a base, which is a side of the trapezoid. If BC is a base and tangent to the parabola, then BC is a line segment that is part of a tangent line to the parabola. Similarly, AB and CD are legs, which are also tangent to the parabola. Let&#39;s try this configuration.Assume BC and AD are the two bases (parallel sides), and AB and CD are the legs (congruent and non-parallel). The trapezoid is isosceles, so it&#39;s symmetric about the y-axis. Then, BC is the top base, AD is the bottom base. Points B and C are on the right and left, respectively, connected by BC. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify the labeling.In a trapezoid, the order of the vertices matters. If BC and AD are the bases, then the vertices are ordered such that BC is connected to CD and AB, but this is getting confusing. Maybe it&#39;s better to assign coordinates.Let me define the trapezoid as follows, symmetric about the y-axis:- Let’s suppose the top base BC is a horizontal line segment tangent to the parabola at its midpoint, which is the vertex (0,2). Then BC is the line y=2, from (-b, 2) to (b, 2). Then, the legs AB and CD go downwards from A to B and from D to C, respectively. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, legs AB and CD are congruent and symmetric. The bottom base AD is another line segment parallel to BC, located at some lower y-coordinate. However, in this case, BC is the top base tangent at (0,2), but the problem states that AB, BC, and CD are tangent. So AB and CD would also need to be tangent to the parabola. Let&#39;s see:If BC is y=2, tangent at (0,2), then AB is the left leg from A to B, and CD is the right leg from C to D. If AB is tangent to the parabola, then the line AB must be tangent at some point. Let&#39;s say AB is tangent at point P on the left side of the parabola, and CD is tangent at point Q on the right side. Due to symmetry, P and Q are symmetric with respect to the y-axis.Let’s denote point B as (b, 2) and point C as (-b, 2). Then, the legs AB and CD go from A to (b, 2) and from D to (-b, 2). Let’s assume that the legs are tangent to the parabola at points P(-p, -½p² + 2) and Q(p, -½p² + 2) for some p &gt; 0.The line AB connects point A to point B(b, 2) and is tangent to the parabola at P(-p, -½p² + 2). Similarly, line CD connects point D to point C(-b, 2) and is tangent to the parabola at Q(p, -½p² + 2). Since the trapezoid is symmetric, the coordinates of A and D should be symmetric. Let&#39;s assume A is (-a, k) and D is (a, k), so the bottom base AD is from (-a, k) to (a, k), a horizontal line. Then, the legs AB and CD are from (-a, k) to (b, 2) and (a, k) to (-b, 2), respectively.Now, the line AB is tangent to the parabola at P(-p, -½p² + 2). Let&#39;s find the equation of line AB. The slope of AB can be calculated in two ways: one using the points A(-a, k) and B(b, 2), and another using the fact that it&#39;s the tangent line at P(-p, -½p² + 2).First, as a tangent line at P(-p, y_p), the slope is given by the derivative at x = -p, which is y’ = -(-p) = p. So the slope of the tangent line at P is p. Therefore, the equation of line AB is:y - y_p = p(x + p)Substituting y_p = -½p² + 2:y - (-½p² + 2) = p(x + p)Simplify:y + ½p² - 2 = p x + p²y = p x + p² - ½p² + 2 - 2Wait, let&#39;s check:Wait, expanding the left side:y = p(x + p) + (-½p² + 2)= p x + p² + (-½p² + 2)= p x + (p² - ½p²) + 2= p x + (½p²) + 2So the equation of tangent line AB is y = p x + ½p² + 2.But this line also passes through points A(-a, k) and B(b, 2). Therefore:For point B(b, 2):2 = p * b + ½p² + 2Subtract 2 from both sides:0 = p b + ½p²=&gt; p b + ½p² = 0=&gt; p (b + ½p) = 0Since p ≠ 0 (otherwise the tangent line would be horizontal at the vertex, which we already considered), we have:b + ½p = 0 =&gt; b = -½p.But b is the x-coordinate of point B, which we assumed to be positive (since it&#39;s on the right side). However, here we get b = -½p, which would be negative if p is positive. Contradiction. Therefore, this suggests an error in the assumptions.Wait, maybe the labeling is incorrect. If the tangent point P is on the left side of the parabola at (-p, y_p), then the line AB is the left leg, going from A(-a, k) to B(b, 2). However, the slope calculated from the tangent line is p, but when we calculate the slope using points A and B, it should also be p.Slope from A(-a, k) to B(b, 2):m = (2 - k)/(b - (-a)) = (2 - k)/(b + a)This slope must equal the slope of the tangent line at P, which is p. Therefore:(2 - k)/(b + a) = p.But also, from the earlier equation from the tangent line passing through B(b, 2):2 = p * b + ½p² + 2.Which simplifies to 0 = p b + ½p² =&gt; same as before.But we found that b = -½p, which would have to be negative. But if b is positive, then p must be negative. Wait, p is the x-coordinate of the point of tangency on the left side, which we took as -p, but if p is negative, then -p becomes positive. Wait, perhaps there&#39;s confusion in variables.Let me redefine the point of tangency. Let&#39;s suppose the left leg AB is tangent to the parabola at point P(p, -½p² + 2), where p &lt; 0 (since it&#39;s on the left side). Then the slope of the tangent line at P is y’ = -p (since derivative is -x). But since p is negative, the slope is positive. Wait, no: if p is the x-coordinate, which is negative, then the slope is -p, which would be positive. So the tangent line at P(p, y_p) (p &lt; 0) has a positive slope.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at P is:y = -p(x - p) + (-½p² + 2)Wait, no: wait, general formula: at point (a, f(a)), the tangent line is y = f’(a)(x - a) + f(a). So here, a = p, f(a) = -½p² + 2, f’(a) = -p.Thus, the tangent line is:y = -p(x - p) + (-½p² + 2) = -p x + p² - ½p² + 2 = -p x + ½p² + 2.But since p is negative, let&#39;s denote p = -q where q &gt; 0. Then the equation becomes:y = -(-q)x + ½(-q)^2 + 2 = q x + ½q² + 2.So the tangent line has a positive slope q, where q = |p|.This line passes through point B(b, 2). Let&#39;s substitute x = b, y = 2 into the equation:2 = q b + ½ q² + 2Subtract 2:0 = q b + ½ q² =&gt; q(b + ½ q) = 0.Since q ≠ 0, then b + ½ q = 0 =&gt; b = -½ q.But b is the x-coordinate of point B on the right side, so b should be positive. But here, b = -½ q, which would be negative since q &gt; 0. Contradiction again. This suggests that the line tangent to the left side of the parabola cannot pass through a point B on the right side with positive x-coordinate. Therefore, perhaps the tangent line is not the left leg but another side.Wait, maybe AB is the top base, not the leg. Let me reassign the sides. Suppose AB is the top base, BC is the right leg, and CD is the bottom base. The trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, so points A and D are on the left and right, B and C are on the top and bottom? Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to use a different notation.Let’s define the trapezoid ABCD with AB and CD as the two bases (parallel), and BC and AD as the legs. The trapezoid is isosceles, so legs BC and AD are congruent and symmetric about the y-axis. AB is the top base, CD is the bottom base. The three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola.Given the symmetry, AB and CD are horizontal lines, tangent to the parabola at their midpoints. Wait, but the only horizontal tangent is y=2. If AB is y=2, then CD would have to be another horizontal line, but as established earlier, it can&#39;t be tangent. Alternatively, AB and CD are non-horizontal lines, but they need to be parallel. However, their slopes would have to match, which as before leads to contradictions unless they are horizontal.Given the problem&#39;s complexity, perhaps I need to approach this with more mathematical rigor.Let’s denote the three tangent lines: AB, BC, CD. Let’s find their equations and use the fact that they are tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2.Let’s denote the tangent points as follows:- AB is tangent at point P(p, -½p² + 2)- BC is tangent at point Q(q, -½q² + 2)- CD is tangent at point R(r, -½r² + 2)Given the trapezoid is isosceles and symmetric about the y-axis, we can assume that:- Points P and R are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So R = (-p, -½p² + 2).- Point Q is on the y-axis, so q = 0. Therefore, Q = (0, -½*0² + 2) = (0, 2). But wait, the tangent at Q(0,2) is horizontal (slope 0). If BC is the leg, which is supposed to be non-parallel, but if BC is horizontal, it would be parallel to AB and CD, which can&#39;t be. Therefore, Q cannot be on the y-axis. Contradiction again. Therefore, my assumption is wrong.Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not symmetric about the y-axis, but is isosceles in another way. However, given the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, it&#39;s natural that the minimal area trapezoid would also be symmetric. Therefore, perhaps my mistake is in assuming Q is on the y-axis. Let&#39;s drop that assumption.Let’s suppose instead that due to the trapezoid&#39;s symmetry, the tangent points P and R are symmetric across the y-axis, and Q is another point. However, BC is a leg, which is not symmetric. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid symmetric about the y-axis, legs BC and AD are mirror images. Therefore, if BC is tangent at Q, then AD should be tangent at Q&#39;, the mirror image of Q. But the problem states only three sides are tangent: AB, BC, CD. Therefore, AD is not tangent. Therefore, perhaps Q is not on the y-axis, but BC is tangent at Q, and AD is not tangent. However, given symmetry, if BC is tangent at Q, AD would have a symmetric tangent point Q&#39;, but the problem doesn&#39;t require AD to be tangent. Therefore, maybe Q is not on the y-axis. But this complicates things.Alternatively, perhaps all three tangent points P, Q, R are on one side of the y-axis, but the trapezoid is still symmetric. This seems unlikely. I might need to consider a different approach.Alternative approach: To find the minimal area of the trapezoid, we can parametrize the trapezoid with certain variables and express the area in terms of those variables, then minimize it.Given the trapezoid is isosceles and three sides are tangent to the parabola, we can use the condition of tangency to relate the sides to the parabola.Let’s consider that the trapezoid has two horizontal bases AB and CD, and two legs BC and AD. Due to the trapezoid being isosceles and the parabola&#39;s symmetry, we can assume AB and CD are horizontal, symmetric about the y-axis. The legs BC and AD are slant sides, also symmetric. However, the problem states that three sides (AB, BC, CD) are tangent to the parabola. So AB, BC, CD are tangent, but AD is not.Let’s define AB as the top base, a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at point P(p, -½p² + 2). Due to the trapezoid&#39;s symmetry, AB is centered on the y-axis, so AB extends from (-a, h) to (a, h), where h is the y-coordinate. Similarly, CD is the bottom base, extending from (-b, k) to (b, k). However, since AB and CD are both horizontal and the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs BC and AD connect (a, h) to (b, k) and (-a, h) to (-b, k), respectively.But AB is tangent to the parabola at P(p, -½p² + 2). Since AB is horizontal, the tangent line at P must be horizontal. The only horizontal tangent line to the parabola is at the vertex (0, 2). Therefore, AB must be the line y=2, tangent at (0,2). Therefore, AB is the line segment from (-a, 2) to (a, 2). Similarly, CD is the line segment from (-b, k) to (b, k), which must also be horizontal. But CD is tangent to the parabola at some point. However, since CD is horizontal and tangent to the parabola, it must also be the line y=2, which would collapse the trapezoid. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, AB cannot be a horizontal line unless it&#39;s at y=2, which is not feasible for a trapezoid with another base CD.Therefore, this suggests that the bases AB and CD are not horizontal. Hence, the trapezoid is not axis-aligned, which complicates things. However, given that it&#39;s isosceles, the trapezoid must be symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, the two bases AB and CD are parallel and symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and the legs BC and AD are congruent and symmetric.Let’s assume that AB is the top base, a line tangent to the parabola at point P(p, -½p² + 2), and CD is the bottom base, tangent at point R(-p, -½p² + 2). Due to the trapezoid&#39;s symmetry, the slopes of AB and CD must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, but since AB and CD are parallel, their slopes must be equal. This is only possible if the slopes are zero, i.e., horizontal lines, but we already saw that this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, AB and CD cannot be both tangent to the parabola unless they are horizontal lines at y=2, which is invalid. Therefore, this approach is not working.Alternative idea: Perhaps the trapezoid is not surrounding the parabola but intersecting it at three tangent points. For example, the top base AB is above the parabola, the leg BC is on the right side tangent to the parabola, and the bottom base CD is below the parabola. But the parabola is only defined between x=-2 and x=2, so CD cannot be too far below. But the bottom base CD would have to be tangent to the parabola at some point within x ∈ [-2, 2]. However, the lowest y-value of the parabola is 0 at x=±2.Wait, the problem states that the three sides are tangent to the graph of the function y = -½x² + 2, x ∈ [-2, 2]. So the sides AB, BC, CD must each touch the parabola at exactly one point within the domain x ∈ [-2, 2]. Therefore, the trapezoid must be arranged such that each of these three sides touches the parabola at one point inside this interval.Given the trapezoid is isosceles, we can model it with the top base AB, right leg BC, and bottom base CD each tangent to the parabola at one point. Let’s parametrize the trapezoid with variables and use calculus to minimize the area.Let’s denote:- Top base AB is tangent to the parabola at point T1(t, -½t² + 2) where t ∈ (-2, 2).- Right leg BC is tangent to the parabola at point T2(s, -½s² + 2) where s ∈ (-2, 2).- Bottom base CD is tangent to the parabola at point T3(u, -½u² + 2) where u ∈ (-2, 2).Due to the trapezoid&#39;s symmetry about the y-axis, we can assume that:- T1 is at (t, -½t² + 2) and its mirror image (-t, -½t² + 2) is not necessarily a tangent point since AB might be a single line. Wait, no. AB is a side of the trapezoid, which is a line segment. If AB is tangent to the parabola, it can only touch at one point. Similarly for CD. Given the trapezoid is symmetric, AB and CD must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so if AB is tangent at (t, y_t), CD is tangent at (-t, y_t). However, AB and CD are parallel, so their slopes must be equal. The slope of AB is the derivative at t, which is -t, and the slope of CD is the derivative at -t, which is t. For AB and CD to be parallel, -t = t =&gt; t = 0. Therefore, the only possibility is t=0, which is the vertex. Therefore, AB and CD are both horizontal lines at y=2, which is not feasible for a trapezoid. Therefore, this approach also leads to a contradiction.This recurring issue suggests that the initial assumption that AB and CD are the two bases might be incorrect. Perhaps instead, the trapezoid has AB and CD as legs and BC as a base. But in that case, since it&#39;s isosceles, legs AB and CD are congruent, and the bases BC and AD are parallel. But the problem states that three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent. If AB and CD are legs and BC is a base, then BC must be tangent to the parabola. Given the symmetry, BC would be horizontal, tangent at the vertex (0,2), and legs AB and CD would be slanting lines tangent at symmetric points.Let’s try this. Let’s assume that BC is the top base, a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at (0,2), so BC is the line y=2, extending from (-b, 2) to (b, 2). Then, the legs AB and CD are lines connecting A(-c, k) to B(-b, 2) and D(c, k) to C(b, 2), respectively. These legs must be tangent to the parabola at some points. Due to symmetry, AB is tangent at (-a, -½a² + 2) and CD is tangent at (a, -½a² + 2). The line AB has to pass through points A(-c, k) and B(-b, 2), and be tangent to the parabola at (-a, -½a² + 2). Similarly for CD.Let’s derive the equation of line AB. The slope of the tangent at (-a, -½a² + 2) is the derivative at x = -a, which is a. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is:y - (-½a² + 2) = a(x + a)Simplifying:y + ½a² - 2 = a x + a²y = a x + a² - ½a² + 2 - 2Wait:Wait, expanding properly:y = a(x + a) + (-½a² + 2)= a x + a² - ½a² + 2= a x + (½a² + 2)So the equation of the tangent line AB is y = a x + ½a² + 2.This line must pass through points A(-c, k) and B(-b, 2).First, plug in B(-b, 2):2 = a*(-b) + ½a² + 2Subtract 2:0 = -a b + ½a²=&gt; ½a² - a b = 0=&gt; a(½a - b) = 0Since a ≠ 0 (otherwise the tangent line would be horizontal), we have:½a - b = 0 =&gt; b = ½a.Similarly, plug in A(-c, k):k = a*(-c) + ½a² + 2=&gt; k = -a c + ½a² + 2.Additionally, the bottom base AD is the line connecting A(-c, k) and D(c, k), which is horizontal (since both have y-coordinate k). Therefore, AD is the line y = k, and since the trapezoid is isosceles, AD is parallel to BC (which is y=2). Therefore, the distance between BC and AD is 2 - k.The legs AB and CD are congruent, and their length can be calculated, but perhaps we can express the area of the trapezoid in terms of a and c.The area of a trapezoid is given by the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. The bases are BC and AD, with lengths 2b and 2c, respectively (since BC is from -b to b, and AD is from -c to c). The height is the distance between the two bases, which is 2 - k.Wait, BC is the top base, length 2b, and AD is the bottom base, length 2c. The height is the vertical distance between y=2 and y=k, which is 2 - k. Therefore, area = ½*(2b + 2c)*(2 - k) = (b + c)*(2 - k).Now, from the earlier equation for k:k = -a c + ½a² + 2.Also, from the relation b = ½a.Therefore, substituting b = ½a, we have:Area = (½a + c)*(2 - k) = (½a + c)*(2 - (-a c + ½a² + 2)).Simplify the expression inside the second parenthesis:2 - k = 2 - (-a c + ½a² + 2) = 2 + a c - ½a² - 2 = a c - ½a².Therefore, Area = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²).We need to express this in terms of a single variable. To do that, we need another relation between a and c. This comes from the fact that point A(-c, k) lies on the tangent line AB, which we already used to get k = -a c + ½a² + 2. However, we need another equation to relate a and c.Wait, perhaps we can find another condition from the bottom base AD. The bottom base AD is the line y = k, which is supposed to be a horizontal line. However, in this configuration, we have not imposed any condition on AD other than it being the bottom base. The problem states that three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. BC is tangent at (0,2), AB is tangent at (-a, -½a² + 2), CD is tangent at (a, -½a² + 2). AD is not tangent. Therefore, we don&#39;t have a condition on AD. Therefore, the only relations are:1. b = ½a2. k = -a c + ½a² + 2But we need another equation to relate a and c. However, perhaps we need to ensure that the bottom base AD does not intersect the parabola, but since AD is part of the trapezoid and the problem doesn&#39;t state that AD is tangent, it just has to be a side. However, if AD is the line y = k, and since the parabola&#39;s minimum y-value is 0, then k must be less than or equal to 0 to lie below the parabola. But if k is below the parabola, AD would not intersect it, but since the parabola is above y=0, k must be less than 0. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether AD is above or below the parabola. If AD is above the parabola, k must be greater than or equal to 2, but then the trapezoid would be flipped. This is getting too vague. Maybe there&#39;s another condition.Wait, the trapezoid must enclose the parabola? Or just have three sides tangent. Since three sides are tangent, AD is not tangent, so it can be anywhere. But we need to find the minimum area, so likely k is above the parabola to have a smaller height.Alternatively, perhaps the bottom base AD is also tangent to the parabola, but the problem states only three sides are tangent. Therefore, AD is not tangent. Therefore, the line AD (y = k) must not intersect the parabola. Since the parabola is at y ≥ 0, if k &lt; 0, then AD is below the parabola and doesn&#39;t intersect. If k ≥ 0, then AD would intersect the parabola unless k &gt; 2, which is above the parabola&#39;s maximum. However, if k &gt; 2, then AD is above the parabola, but since the top base BC is at y=2, the height would be 2 - k &lt; 0, which doesn&#39;t make sense. Therefore, k must be less than 0, so AD is below the parabola.Therefore, k &lt; 0, and the distance between BC (y=2) and AD (y=k) is 2 - k.But then the area is (½a + c)*(2 - k) = (½a + c)*(2 - (-a c + ½a² + 2)) = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²) as before.But we need to express this in terms of a single variable. Let&#39;s try to express c in terms of a. From the equation k = -a c + ½a² + 2, and since k &lt; 0, we have:-a c + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0=&gt; -a c &lt; -½a² - 2=&gt; c &gt; (½a² + 2)/a (since dividing by -a reverses the inequality)=&gt; c &gt; (a/2 + 2/a)But this is a condition on c. However, we need another equation to relate a and c.Wait, perhaps there&#39;s an additional geometric constraint. The bottom base AD is the line segment from (-c, k) to (c, k). For the trapezoid to close properly, the legs AB and CD must connect to AD. The leg AB goes from B(-b, 2) to A(-c, k), and the leg CD goes from C(b, 2) to D(c, k). The slopes of AB and CD must be equal due to the trapezoid being isosceles, but since it&#39;s symmetric, their slopes are negatives of each other. Wait, no. In an isosceles trapezoid symmetric about the y-axis, the legs AB and CD have slopes that are negatives of each other. Therefore, the slope of AB is (k - 2)/(-c + b) and the slope of CD is (k - 2)/(c - b). Given the symmetry, these slopes should be negatives. However, this seems not necessarily true unless specific conditions are met. Wait, if the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, then the legs AB and CD are mirror images, so their slopes are negatives. Therefore:Slope of AB = (k - 2)/(-c + b) = mSlope of CD = (k - 2)/(c - b) = -mTherefore, these two expressions should be negatives:(k - 2)/(-c + b) = - (k - 2)/(c - b)But note that (c - b) = -(-c + b), so:(k - 2)/(-c + b) = - (k - 2)/(-(-c + b)) = - (k - 2)/(c - b) = slope of CDTherefore, this holds true, so the slopes are negatives as required by symmetry. Therefore, there&#39;s no new information here.Wait, perhaps we can relate a and c through the equation of the tangent line. The line AB is the tangent to the parabola at (-a, -½a² + 2). We already used that to get the equation y = a x + ½a² + 2, which passes through B(-b, 2) and A(-c, k). We have two equations:1. For point B(-b, 2):2 = a*(-b) + ½a² + 2 =&gt; 0 = -a b + ½a² =&gt; b = ½a.2. For point A(-c, k):k = a*(-c) + ½a² + 2 =&gt; k = -a c + ½a² + 2.Additionally, the bottom base AD is the line y = k, from (-c, k) to (c, k). Since AD is not tangent to the parabola, the line y = k does not touch the parabola. The parabola has a minimum y-value of 0, so k must be less than 0 to ensure AD is below the parabola.Therefore, we have two variables a and c, related by k = -a c + ½a² + 2, with k &lt; 0. Our goal is to express the area in terms of a single variable and minimize it.Let’s express c in terms of a from the equation for k:k = -a c + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0=&gt; -a c &lt; -½a² - 2=&gt; c &gt; (½a² + 2)/aBut since c is positive (as it&#39;s the x-coordinate of point A(-c, k)), we can write:c = (½a² + 2)/a + t, where t &gt; 0.But this might complicate things. Alternatively, express c from k:k = -a c + ½a² + 2 =&gt; c = (½a² + 2 - k)/a.But since k &lt; 0, we have:c = (½a² + 2 - k)/a &gt; (½a² + 2)/a.But this might not help directly. Alternatively, let&#39;s use the area expression.Area = (b + c)*(2 - k) = (½a + c)*(2 - k).But we can substitute k from the equation k = -a c + ½a² + 2:Area = (½a + c)*(2 - (-a c + ½a² + 2)) = (½a + c)*(2 + a c - ½a² - 2) = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²)Factor out a:= (½a + c)*a(c - ½a)= a(½a + c)(c - ½a)Let’s expand this:= a [c^2 - (½a)^2] (since (x + y)(x - y) = x² - y²)= a(c² - ¼a²)But we need to express this in terms of a single variable. Let&#39;s substitute c from the equation k = -a c + ½a² + 2. However, k is also related to c. Let&#39;s solve for c in terms of a:From k = -a c + ½a² + 2, and k &lt; 0:- a c + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; a c &gt; ½a² + 2 =&gt; c &gt; (½a² + 2)/a.But c is also related to the area expression. Let&#39;s denote d = c, then:Area = a(d² - ¼a²)But from k = -a d + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; d &gt; (½a² + 2)/a.Let’s set d = (½a² + 2)/a + t, where t &gt; 0.Then,Area = a[((½a² + 2)/a + t)^2 - ¼a²]But this might not be helpful.Alternatively, let&#39;s express c in terms of a:From k = -a c + ½a² + 2, we can write:c = (½a² + 2 - k)/aBut since k &lt; 0, we can write:c = (½a² + 2 - k)/a &gt; (½a² + 2)/aBut we don&#39;t know k&#39;s value. Alternatively, perhaps express the area in terms of a only.Alternatively, consider using calculus. Let&#39;s express the area as a function of a. From c &gt; (½a² + 2)/a, but we need to express c in terms of a. However, without another equation, we cannot reduce this to a single variable. Therefore, there must be a missing relation.Wait, the bottom base AD is the line y = k, which connects (-c, k) to (c, k). For the trapezoid to close, the legs AB and CD must intersect the bottom base AD at (-c, k) and (c, k). But since we already used the conditions that AB passes through (-c, k) and (-b, 2), and CD passes through (c, k) and (b, 2), there are no more conditions. Therefore, there&#39;s a degree of freedom here. However, to minimize the area, we might need to express the area in terms of a and c with the constraint k &lt; 0, then use calculus to find the minimum.Let’s denote the area as:A(a, c) = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²)With the constraint:k = -a c + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; -a c + ½a² + 2 &lt; 0 =&gt; a c &gt; ½a² + 2We need to find the minimum of A(a, c) under the constraint a c &gt; ½a² + 2, with a &gt; 0 (since b = ½a and b must be positive) and c &gt; 0.This is an optimization problem with two variables. To solve it, we can use substitution. From the constraint:a c &gt; ½a² + 2 =&gt; c &gt; (½a² + 2)/a.Let’s set c = (½a² + 2)/a + t, where t &gt; 0. Then, substitute into the area:A(a, t) = (½a + (½a² + 2)/a + t)*(a*(½a² + 2)/a + a t - ½a²)Simplify:First term: ½a + (½a² + 2)/a + t = ½a + ½a + 2/a + t = a + 2/a + tSecond term: a*(½a² + 2)/a + a t - ½a² = (½a² + 2) + a t - ½a² = 2 + a tTherefore, A(a, t) = (a + 2/a + t)*(2 + a t)This complicates things further. Alternatively, use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum with the constraint.Let’s form the Lagrangian:L(a, c, λ) = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²) + λ(½a² + 2 - a c)We need to find the critical points by taking partial derivatives:∂L/∂a = ½*(a c - ½a²) + (½a + c)*(c - a) + λ(a - c) = 0∂L/∂c = (½a + c)*a + (a c - ½a²)*1 + λ*(-a) = 0∂L/∂λ = ½a² + 2 - a c = 0The last equation is the binding constraint: ½a² + 2 - a c = 0 =&gt; c = (½a² + 2)/a.Substituting c into the first two equations.First, compute c = (½a² + 2)/a = ½a + 2/a.Compute ∂L/∂a:First term: ½*(a c - ½a²) = ½*(a*(½a + 2/a) - ½a²) = ½*(½a² + 2 - ½a²) = ½*2 = 1Second term: (½a + c)*(c - a) = (½a + ½a + 2/a)*(½a + 2/a - a) = (a + 2/a)*(-½a + 2/a)Third term: λ*(a - c) = λ*(a - ½a - 2/a) = λ*(½a - 2/a)Thus, ∂L/∂a = 1 + (a + 2/a)*(-½a + 2/a) + λ*(½a - 2/a) = 0Similarly, compute ∂L/∂c:First term: (½a + c)*a = (½a + ½a + 2/a)*a = (a + 2/a)*a = a² + 2Second term: (a c - ½a²)*1 = (a*(½a + 2/a) - ½a²) = (½a² + 2 - ½a²) = 2Third term: λ*(-a) = -a λThus, ∂L/∂c = a² + 2 + 2 - a λ = a² + 4 - a λ = 0 =&gt; λ = (a² + 4)/aNow, substitute λ into the equation for ∂L/∂a:1 + (a + 2/a)*(-½a + 2/a) + ( (a² + 4)/a )*(½a - 2/a ) = 0Compute term by term:First term: 1Second term: (a + 2/a)*(-½a + 2/a) = -½a² + 2/a * a + (-2/a * ½a) + (2/a * 2/a) = -½a² + 2 - 1 + 4/a² = -½a² + 1 + 4/a²Wait, alternatively, multiply directly:(a + 2/a)(-½a + 2/a) = a*(-½a) + a*(2/a) + (2/a)*(-½a) + (2/a)*(2/a)= -½a² + 2 - 1 + 4/a²= -½a² + 1 + 4/a²Third term: ((a² + 4)/a)*(½a - 2/a) = (a² + 4)/a * ( (a² - 4)/ (2a) ) ??? Wait, let&#39;s compute:First, expand:( (a² + 4)/a ) * (½a - 2/a ) = (a² + 4)/a * ( (a² - 4)/ (2a) ) Wait, no:Let’s compute ½a - 2/a:= (a² - 4)/ (2a)Therefore,( (a² + 4)/a ) * ( (a² - 4)/ (2a) ) = (a² + 4)(a² - 4)/(2a²) ) = (a^4 - 16)/(2a²)But maybe that&#39;s not helpful. Alternatively, compute directly:( (a² + 4)/a ) * (½a - 2/a ) = (a² + 4)/a * ½a - (a² + 4)/a * 2/a= (a² + 4)*½ - 2(a² + 4)/a²= ½(a² + 4) - 2(a² + 4)/a²Now, combine all terms:1 + (-½a² + 1 + 4/a²) + [½(a² + 4) - 2(a² + 4)/a²] = 0Expand:1 -½a² + 1 + 4/a² + ½a² + 2 - 2(a² + 4)/a² = 0Combine like terms:1 + 1 + 2 = 4-½a² + ½a² = 04/a² - 2(a² + 4)/a² = 4/a² - 2a²/a² - 8/a² = (4 - 2a² - 8)/a² = (-2a² - 4)/a²Therefore, the equation becomes:4 + (-2a² - 4)/a² = 0Multiply through by a²:4a² -2a² -4 = 0 =&gt; 2a² -4 = 0 =&gt; 2a² =4 =&gt; a²=2 =&gt; a=√2Therefore, a=√2.Then, compute c = ½a + 2/a = ½√2 + 2/√2 = (√2/2) + (2√2/2) = (√2/2) + √2 = (3√2)/2Therefore, c = 3√2/2Now, compute the area:A = (½a + c)*(a c - ½a²)Substitute a=√2, c=3√2/2:First, compute ½a = ½√2½a + c = ½√2 + 3√2/2 = (1/2 + 3/2)√2 = 2√2Compute a c = √2*(3√2/2) = 3*2/2 = 3Compute ½a² = ½*(2) = 1Thus, a c - ½a² = 3 - 1 = 2Therefore, Area = 2√2 * 2 = 4√2Therefore, the minimum area is 4√2.Final Answerboxed{4sqrt{2}}&lt;/think&gt;To find the minimum value of the area of the isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) with sides (AB), (BC), and (CD) tangent to the parabola (y = -frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2), we start by considering the symmetry and tangency conditions. 1. Symmetry and Tangency Conditions:   - The trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis.   - The top base (AB) and bottom base (CD) are parallel and horizontal.   - The legs (BC) and (AD) are congruent and symmetric.2. Equations of Tangent Lines:   - The tangent line at a point ((a, -frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2)) on the parabola has the equation (y = -ax + frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2).   - For symmetry, the points of tangency for (AB) and (CD) are ((a, -frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2)) and ((-a, -frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2)).3. Optimization Setup:   - The top base (AB) and bottom base (CD) are tangent to the parabola at points ((a, -frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2)) and ((-a, -frac{1}{2}a^2 + 2)).   - The legs (BC) and (AD) are tangent to the parabola at the vertex ((0, 2)) which is a horizontal line (y = 2).4. Area Calculation:   - The length of the top base (AB) and bottom base (CD) are (2a) and (2c) respectively.   - The height of the trapezoid is the vertical distance between the bases, which is (2 - k) where (k) is the y-coordinate of the,&lt;think&gt;Alright, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an isosceles trapezoid ABCD, and three of its sides—AB, BC, and CD—are tangent to the graph of the function y = -½x² + 2, which is defined on the interval [-2, 2]. We need to find the minimum area of this trapezoid.First, let&#39;s visualize this. The function is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0, 2). The parabola intersects the x-axis at points where y=0, so solving -½x² + 2 = 0 gives x² = 4, so x = ±2. That makes sense because the domain given is [-2, 2], so the parabola is drawn from (-2, 0) to (2, 0), peaking at (0, 2). The trapezoid is isosceles, meaning it&#39;s symmetric about the y-axis. The sides AB, BC, and CD are tangent to this parabola. Points P, Q, R are the points of tangency.Since it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, sides AB and CD are the two non-parallel sides and are equal in length. Wait, no—actually, in an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides (the legs) are equal. But here, AB, BC, and CD are tangent. So maybe BC is the top base, AB and CD are the legs, and DA is the bottom base? But then it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, so legs AB and CD are equal and non-parallel, and the bases BC and DA are parallel.But the trapezoid is sitting around the parabola. Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, the trapezoid must also be symmetric. Therefore, BC and DA should be horizontal lines, with BC above the parabola and DA below? Wait, but DA is the bottom base. Wait, the parabola is between x = -2 and 2, so maybe DA is the line segment from (-2, 0) to (2, 0), but the problem says the three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. Hmm.Wait, the problem states that the three sides AB, BC, and CD are tangent to the parabola at points P, Q, R. Since it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, symmetry suggests that BC is the top base, centered on the y-axis, and AB and CD are the legs, each tangent to the parabola. Then DA is the bottom base, which is the line from (-2, 0) to (2, 0), since that&#39;s where the parabola meets the x-axis. But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t specify where DA is. Maybe DA is also tangent? But no, it says three sides: AB, BC, CD.So the bottom base DA isn&#39;t tangent. So DA is the line from (-a, 0) to (a, 0), but wait, the parabola is between x = -2 and 2. Wait, no, the function is defined for x ∈ [-2, 2], so the parabola is drawn between x = -2 and 2, but if the trapezoid is around it, maybe DA is the line segment from (-2, 0) to (2, 0), but then DA is part of the x-axis. But if AB, BC, CD are tangent, then BC must be the top base, AB and CD the legs, and DA the bottom base. Since it&#39;s isosceles, BC is centered, AB and CD are symmetric.Let me try to sketch this mentally. The parabola is opening downward, vertex at (0,2), crossing the x-axis at (-2,0) and (2,0). The trapezoid ABCD has AB, BC, CD tangent to the parabola. So points of tangency P, Q, R are on AB, BC, CD. Since it&#39;s symmetric, the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, points B and C must be on the top base BC, which is horizontal, and points A and D are on the bottom base DA, which is also horizontal. Since it&#39;s isosceles, the legs AB and CD are equal in length and symmetric.Therefore, the trapezoid has two parallel sides: BC (the top) and DA (the bottom). The legs AB and CD connect them. Since three sides are tangent to the parabola, BC is tangent at point Q, which is likely the vertex (0,2), but since the vertex is at (0,2), and the top base BC is a horizontal line above the parabola, but BC has to be tangent. Wait, but the vertex is the highest point of the parabola, so the only horizontal tangent line at the vertex is y = 2. But if BC is the line y = 2, then it&#39;s just the single point (0,2), which can&#39;t be a side. So that doesn&#39;t make sense.Therefore, BC is not horizontal? Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the bases are parallel and the legs are non-parallel. So if BC is the top base, it should be parallel to DA. If DA is the bottom base along the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0), then BC must also be horizontal. But how can a horizontal line above the parabola be tangent to the parabola? The parabola&#39;s highest point is at (0,2), so any horizontal line above y=2 won&#39;t intersect the parabola, and a horizontal line at y=2 touches only at (0,2). So BC cannot be a horizontal line above the parabola unless it&#39;s y=2, which is just a point. Therefore, maybe BC is not the top base but a leg?Wait, maybe the trapezoid is oriented differently. Let&#39;s clarify the structure of the trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length, and the base angles are equal. Since the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, the legs AB and CD must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis, and the bases BC and DA must be horizontal.But if BC is the top base and DA is the bottom base, then BC is a horizontal line segment above the parabola, DA is a horizontal line segment below the parabola. But DA is the bottom base, which would be along the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0), but since the parabola is also on the x-axis at those points, maybe DA coincides with the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0). But then DA is part of the x-axis, and the trapezoid would have DA as the base, BC as the top base, and legs AB and CD connecting them. However, AB, BC, and CD are all tangent to the parabola. So BC is the top base, tangent at point Q, and AB and CD are the legs, each tangent at points P and R respectively.Given that the trapezoid is symmetric, points P and R should be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let&#39;s denote the coordinates of the points of tangency. Let me consider a general case. Let’s assume that the top base BC is a horizontal line tangent to the parabola at some point Q. Since the parabola is symmetric, if BC is horizontal and tangent, then Q must be at the vertex (0,2), but as mentioned before, that&#39;s a single point. So perhaps BC is not horizontal. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the bases must be parallel. If DA is horizontal (along the x-axis), then BC must also be horizontal. But then BC can only be tangent at (0,2), which is a single point. Therefore, perhaps BC is not the top base? Hmm, maybe the trapezoid is rotated or something.Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not having DA along the x-axis. Maybe DA is another line. Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify where the trapezoid is. It just says that the three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. So maybe DA is not fixed. So we have to consider a general isosceles trapezoid with three sides tangent to the parabola. The goal is to find the minimum area.So perhaps we need to parametrize the trapezoid. Let me think. Since it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, symmetric about the y-axis. Let’s denote the coordinates. Let’s suppose that the top base BC is a horizontal line segment above the parabola, and the legs AB and CD are symmetric, slanting down to the bottom base DA, which is also horizontal. The three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. So BC is tangent at some point Q, and AB and CD are each tangent at points P and R, which are symmetric.Let me denote the top base BC. Let’s suppose that point B is (b, h) and point C is (-b, h) because of symmetry. Then BC is the line segment from (-b, h) to (b, h). Then the legs AB and CD go from (b, h) to (a, k) and (-b, h) to (-a, k), respectively, where DA is the bottom base from (-a, k) to (a, k). But since DA is the bottom base, which is also horizontal. But the problem says three sides are tangent: AB, BC, CD. So each of these sides must be tangent to the parabola.First, let&#39;s consider the top base BC. It&#39;s the line y = h, from (-b, h) to (b, h). For this line to be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2, the equation y = h must touch the parabola at exactly one point. The parabola is y = -½x² + 2. Setting y = h, we get -½x² + 2 = h → x² = 2(2 - h). For there to be exactly one solution, the discriminant should be zero. Wait, but x² = 2(2 - h) will have two solutions unless 2(2 - h) = 0, which gives h = 2. So the only horizontal tangent line is y = 2, which touches at x = 0. Therefore, BC must be the line y = 2, but that&#39;s just the point (0,2), which can&#39;t be a side. Therefore, BC cannot be a horizontal line unless it&#39;s at y = 2, which is a single point. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.So perhaps BC is not horizontal. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the two bases are parallel. If DA is horizontal (assuming it&#39;s along the x-axis), then BC must also be horizontal. But as we saw, that leads to a problem. Alternatively, maybe DA is not horizontal? Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t specify the orientation of the trapezoid, just that it&#39;s isosceles. But typically, isosceles trapezoid refers to one with the bases horizontal. However, maybe not necessarily. Wait, but the problem mentions the trapezoid is isosceles, which means the legs are congruent and base angles are equal, but the bases can be at any angle. However, given that the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, it&#39;s likely that the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, with its bases horizontal.Hmm. So maybe the problem is that BC cannot be a horizontal line unless it&#39;s at y=2, but that&#39;s a single point, so instead, BC is a non-horizontal side. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the two bases are the two parallel sides. If BC is a side, then either BC is a base or a leg. But the problem says three sides: AB, BC, CD are tangent. If BC is a leg, then the two bases are AB and CD? Wait, no. In a trapezoid, only two sides are parallel. So if it&#39;s an isosceles trapezoid, the two parallel sides are the bases, and the other two sides are the legs. So if three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent, then among these, two must be the legs and one must be a base.But in a trapezoid, the two legs are non-parallel, and the two bases are parallel. So if AB, BC, CD are three sides, then perhaps BC is a base, and AB and CD are legs. Since it&#39;s isosceles, AB and CD are congruent legs, and BC and DA are the two bases.Given the symmetry, BC is the top base, DA is the bottom base, and AB and CD are the legs. So BC is a line segment above the parabola, DA is a line segment below the parabola. However, DA is not necessarily the x-axis. Wait, but the parabola is between x=-2 and 2, but DA could be somewhere else.Wait, maybe we need to parameterize the trapezoid. Let&#39;s consider that the trapezoid has its top base BC tangent to the parabola at point Q, and legs AB and CD tangent at points P and R. Due to symmetry, points Q, P, R must be located such that Q is on the y-axis (since BC is horizontal and tangent), but earlier we saw that the only horizontal tangent is at (0,2). But that can&#39;t form a base. So perhaps BC is not horizontal? Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the two bases must be parallel. If BC is not horizontal, then DA must also be non-horizontal, but how?Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not with horizontal bases. Wait, but then how is it an isosceles trapezoid? An isosceles trapezoid is defined as a trapezoid with the legs congruent, but the bases can be at any angle as long as they&#39;re parallel. However, given the symmetry about the y-axis, it&#39;s more likely that the trapezoid is aligned vertically, with the bases horizontal.But if BC is a non-horizontal side, then DA must be parallel to BC. So if BC is slanting, DA is also slanting. However, the legs AB and CD would then be the non-parallel sides. Wait, no. In a trapezoid, the two parallel sides are the bases. So if BC and DA are the bases, then they must be parallel. If they are not horizontal, then the legs AB and CD are non-parallel. But in an isosceles trapezoid, legs are congruent and base angles are equal. So perhaps the trapezoid is &quot;tilted&quot;.But given that the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, the trapezoid must also be symmetric. So BC and DA are both symmetric about the y-axis, and AB and CD are mirror images.This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe we need to approach this problem using calculus and optimization.Let me consider the general equation of a tangent line to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Let&#39;s find the equation of the tangent line at a point (t, -½t² + 2).First, find the derivative of y = -½x² + 2. The derivative is dy/dx = -x. So at point x = t, the slope of the tangent line is -t.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at (t, -½t² + 2) is:y - (-½t² + 2) = -t(x - t)Simplify:y + ½t² - 2 = -tx + t²So,y = -tx + t² - ½t² + 2Simplify:y = -tx + ½t² + 2So the equation of the tangent line at point t is y = -tx + ½t² + 2.Now, since the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis, the tangent points on AB and CD must be at parameters t and -t. Let’s assume that points P and R are at parameters t and -t, so their tangent lines are y = -tx + ½t² + 2 and y = tx + ½t² + 2, respectively.Additionally, the top base BC is also a tangent to the parabola. Let&#39;s denote the tangent point as Q. Due to symmetry, Q should be at the vertex (0,2). Wait, but if we take the tangent line at (0,2), the slope is 0, so the equation is y = 2. However, as before, this is a horizontal line that only touches the parabola at (0,2). If BC is this line, then BC would be the line y=2 from (-b, 2) to (b, 2), but since the line y=2 only intersects the parabola at (0,2), this line cannot be a side of the trapezoid unless b=0, which is a degenerate trapezoid. Therefore, BC cannot be the horizontal tangent at (0,2). So maybe the tangent line for BC is not horizontal.Wait, but how else can BC be tangent? If BC is a side of the trapezoid, then it&#39;s a line segment connecting two vertices. Since the trapezoid is isosceles and symmetric about the y-axis, BC must connect points (c, d) and (-c, d) for some c and d. The line BC would be horizontal if d is constant, but as we saw, horizontal lines only touch the parabola at (0,2). If BC is not horizontal, then it&#39;s a slanted line. Let&#39;s consider that.Alternatively, maybe BC is another tangent line to the parabola, not horizontal. Let&#39;s suppose that the tangent line for BC is at some parameter s, so its equation is y = -s x + ½s² + 2. Since BC is the top base, it&#39;s symmetric, so it must pass through the y-axis. Let&#39;s suppose that the tangent point Q is at (0, q). Wait, but the parabola at x=0 is y=2. So if the tangent line passes through (0, q), but the tangent line at x=0 is y=2. So unless s=0, the tangent line at parameter s=0 is y=2. Any other tangent line would have a non-zero slope.But if BC is tangent to the parabola at some point not on the y-axis, then it would be asymmetric. Wait, but the trapezoid is symmetric, so the tangent point for BC must lie on the y-axis. Therefore, Q is (0,2), and the tangent line is y=2, which as before, can&#39;t form a side. Therefore, this seems contradictory.Wait, maybe BC is not a single tangent line but the side BC is made up of two tangent lines? No, a side is a straight line, so it can only be tangent at one point.Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think differently. Since three sides are tangent to the parabola, and the trapezoid is symmetric, perhaps two of the tangent points are on the legs (AB and CD) and one on the top base BC. So each leg is tangent to the parabola at some point, and the top base is also tangent at a point.Given the symmetry, the two legs AB and CD are tangent at symmetric points (t, -½t² + 2) and (-t, -½t² + 2). The top base BC is tangent at the point (0, 2), but as we saw, this is a horizontal line y=2, which can&#39;t form a base unless it&#39;s a single point.Alternatively, maybe the top base BC is tangent at some other point. Wait, but if it&#39;s symmetric, the tangent point must be on the y-axis. So it has to be (0,2). So BC is the line y=2, which is just the point (0,2). Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not as I thought.Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not surrounding the parabola but the parabola is inside the trapezoid, and the sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. So the parabola is inside the trapezoid, and three sides touch it at one point each. Given the parabola opens downward, so the trapezoid must be above the parabola. Wait, but the parabola&#39;s highest point is at (0,2), so the trapezoid must enclose the parabola from above? But the parabola is already opening downward.Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is such that the three sides AB, BC, CD are all above the parabola, tangent to it. Then DA is the fourth side, which is the base below. But since the parabola is between x=-2 and 2, DA would have to be at the bottom, but the parabola is already touching the x-axis at (-2,0) and (2,0). So maybe DA is the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0), making the trapezoid have vertices at (-2,0), (2,0), and the top base BC somewhere above, tangent to the parabola, along with the legs AB and CD.But in that case, DA is fixed as the line from (-2,0) to (2,0), and BC is a line segment above, with AB and CD connecting (-2,0) to B and (2,0) to C. But since the trapezoid is isosceles, B and C must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let&#39;s denote B as (a, b) and C as (-a, b). Then AB is the line from (-2, 0) to (a, b), and CD is the line from (2, 0) to (-a, b). Then BC is the line from (a, b) to (-a, b). The three sides AB, BC, CD must be tangent to the parabola.So we have three tangent lines: AB, BC, CD. Each must be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Let&#39;s find the equations of these lines and impose the tangency condition.First, let&#39;s find the equation of side AB. It connects (-2, 0) to (a, b). The slope of AB is (b - 0)/(a - (-2)) = b/(a + 2). The equation is y = [b/(a + 2)](x + 2).Similarly, the equation of CD is y = [b/( -a - 2)](x - 2), but since CD connects (2, 0) to (-a, b), the slope is (b - 0)/(-a - 2) = -b/(a + 2). So equation is y = [-b/(a + 2)](x - 2).The equation of BC is horizontal? Wait, BC connects (a, b) to (-a, b), so it&#39;s a horizontal line y = b.But for BC to be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2, the line y = b must touch the parabola. As before, setting y = b gives x² = 2(2 - b). For tangency, this equation must have exactly one solution. However, x² = 2(2 - b) will have two solutions unless 2(2 - b) = 0, i.e., b = 2. Therefore, BC must be the line y = 2, which is tangent at (0, 2). But BC is the line from (a, 2) to (-a, 2). Therefore, BC is the line y = 2 from (-a, 2) to (a, 2). But the parabola at y=2 is only the point (0, 2). Therefore, the line BC (y=2) would only intersect the parabola at (0, 2), which is the midpoint of BC. Therefore, BC is tangent at its midpoint (0,2). So that works.Therefore, BC is the line y=2 from (-a, 2) to (a, 2), tangent at (0,2). Then the legs AB and CD are lines from (-2,0) to (a,2) and (2,0) to (-a,2), respectively. These legs must also be tangent to the parabola.So we need to find the value of a such that the lines AB and CD are tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2.Let&#39;s find the equation of line AB. It connects (-2, 0) to (a, 2). The slope m is (2 - 0)/(a - (-2)) = 2/(a + 2). The equation is:y - 0 = [2/(a + 2)](x + 2)So y = [2/(a + 2)](x + 2)Similarly, the equation of CD is y = [2/( - (a) - 2)](x - 2) but since CD connects (2, 0) to (-a, 2), the slope is (2 - 0)/(-a - 2) = 2/(-a -2) = -2/(a + 2). So equation is:y - 0 = [-2/(a + 2)](x - 2)So y = [-2/(a + 2)](x - 2)Now, we need these lines AB and CD to be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Let&#39;s check for line AB first.Equation of AB: y = [2/(a + 2)](x + 2)We need this line to be tangent to the parabola. To find the condition for tangency, we can set the equation of the line equal to the parabola and ensure that the discriminant is zero.So:[2/(a + 2)](x + 2) = -½x² + 2Multiply both sides by (a + 2):2(x + 2) = -½x²(a + 2) + 2(a + 2)Simplify:2x + 4 = -½(a + 2)x² + 2(a + 2)Bring all terms to one side:½(a + 2)x² + 2x + 4 - 2(a + 2) = 0Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:(a + 2)x² + 4x + 8 - 4(a + 2) = 0Simplify:(a + 2)x² + 4x + 8 - 4a - 8 = 0So:(a + 2)x² + 4x - 4a = 0For this quadratic equation to have exactly one solution (tangency), the discriminant must be zero.Discriminant D = 16 - 4*(a + 2)*(-4a) = 16 + 16a(a + 2)Set D = 0:16 + 16a(a + 2) = 0Divide both sides by 16:1 + a(a + 2) = 0Expand:a² + 2a + 1 = 0Factor:(a + 1)^2 = 0Therefore, a = -1But a is the x-coordinate of point B, which we assumed to be (a, 2). But since the trapezoid is to the right of the y-axis, a should be positive. However, a = -1 would place point B at (-1, 2), which is on the left side. But we initially assumed point B is (a, 2) with a positive. Maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, perhaps the parameterization is flipped. If we take a to be positive, but solving gives a = -1, which suggests a contradiction. This implies that our assumption might be wrong. Wait, but let&#39;s check.Wait, the problem states that the trapezoid is isosceles, which we took as symmetric about the y-axis. If a is -1, then point B is (-1, 2), and point C would be (1, 2), but then BC is from (-1,2) to (1,2), which is symmetric. Then AB is from (-2,0) to (-1,2). Similarly, CD is from (2,0) to (1,2). But in this case, a = -1 for point B, which is (-1,2). However, in our earlier setup, we considered point B as (a,2) where a is positive, but the solution gives a negative. This suggests that perhaps a should be allowed to be negative, but since the trapezoid is symmetric, points B and C are at (-a, 2) and (a, 2) with a positive. Wait, maybe I mixed up the notation.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the coordinates. Let me re-define points B and C as (h, k) and (-h, k) where h &gt; 0. Then BC is the line from (-h, k) to (h, k), which is horizontal. Then AB is the line from (-2, 0) to (h, k), and CD is the line from (2, 0) to (-h, k). Wait, but this would make AB and CD have different slopes unless k is related to h. Wait, but in this case, we need AB and CD to be tangent to the parabola. Let me redo the equations with this notation.Let’s denote point B as (h, k) and point C as (-h, k). Then BC is the horizontal line y = k from (-h, k) to (h, k). Then AB is the line from (-2, 0) to (h, k), and CD is the line from (2, 0) to (-h, k). These two legs must be tangent to the parabola. Also, BC must be tangent to the parabola.First, let&#39;s find the condition for BC. The line BC is y = k, which must be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Setting y = k equal to the parabola:k = -½x² + 2 =&gt; x² = 2(2 - k)For tangency, this equation must have exactly one solution, which occurs when 2(2 - k) = 0 =&gt; k = 2. Therefore, BC must be the line y = 2, tangent at (0, 2). Therefore, h can be any value, but BC is the line from (-h, 2) to (h, 2). However, the line y=2 is only tangent at (0,2), so the side BC is the line segment from (-h, 2) to (h, 2), which is horizontal and lies above the parabola.Now, the legs AB and CD must be tangent to the parabola. Let&#39;s find the equations of AB and CD.Line AB connects (-2, 0) to (h, 2). The slope is (2 - 0)/(h - (-2)) = 2/(h + 2). The equation is:y = [2/(h + 2)](x + 2)Similarly, line CD connects (2, 0) to (-h, 2). The slope is (2 - 0)/(-h - 2) = 2/(-h - 2) = -2/(h + 2). The equation is:y = [-2/(h + 2)](x - 2)Now, these two lines must be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. Let&#39;s first consider line AB: y = [2/(h + 2)](x + 2). To find the condition for tangency, set this equal to the parabola:[2/(h + 2)](x + 2) = -½x² + 2Multiply both sides by (h + 2):2(x + 2) = -½x²(h + 2) + 2(h + 2)Simplify:2x + 4 = -½(h + 2)x² + 2h + 4Bring all terms to the left side:½(h + 2)x² + 2x + 4 - 2h - 4 = 0Simplify:½(h + 2)x² + 2x - 2h = 0Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:(h + 2)x² + 4x - 4h = 0For this quadratic equation to have exactly one solution (tangency), the discriminant must be zero.Discriminant D = 16 - 4*(h + 2)*(-4h) = 16 + 16h(h + 2)Set D = 0:16 + 16h(h + 2) = 0Divide by 16:1 + h(h + 2) = 0Expand:h² + 2h + 1 = 0Factor:(h + 1)^2 = 0 =&gt; h = -1But h is the x-coordinate of point B, which we assumed to be positive (since it&#39;s (h, 2)), but h = -1 is negative. This suggests that there is no solution with h &gt; 0. This is a contradiction. What went wrong?Wait, this implies that under the current setup, where BC is the horizontal line y=2, there is no real positive h for which the legs AB and CD are tangent to the parabola. Therefore, perhaps BC is not the line y=2. But earlier, we saw that BC must be y=2 to be tangent to the parabola. Therefore, this suggests that there is a mistake in our approach.Alternatively, maybe BC is not horizontal. Let&#39;s drop the assumption that BC is horizontal. Let&#39;s consider that BC is a non-horizontal side, tangent to the parabola at some point, and due to the trapezoid&#39;s symmetry, BC is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.Let’s denote the three tangent points as P, Q, R. Let’s say P is on AB, Q is on BC, and R is on CD. Due to symmetry, Q must lie on the y-axis, so Q is (0, q) for some q. Similarly, P and R are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let’s denote P as (t, p) and R as (-t, p).But the points P, Q, R are points of tangency on AB, BC, CD respectively. Let me attempt to parameterize the trapezoid based on the tangent points.Let’s start by considering the tangent lines. Each side AB, BC, CD is tangent to the parabola. Let’s denote the tangent points as follows:- For side AB: tangent at point P (t, -½t² + 2)- For side BC: tangent at point Q (0, 2) (vertex)- For side CD: tangent at point R (-t, -½t² + 2)Since the trapezoid is symmetric, the tangent points on AB and CD are symmetric.The tangent lines at P and R have slopes -t and t, respectively (since derivative at x=t is -t). The tangent line at Q (0,2) has slope 0.Therefore, the equations of the tangent lines are:- At P: y = -t(x - t) + (-½t² + 2) = -tx + t² + (-½t² + 2) = -tx + (½t² + 2)- At Q: y = 2 (horizontal line)- At R: y = t(x + t) + (-½t² + 2) = tx + t² + (-½t² + 2) = tx + (½t² + 2)Now, these three lines (AB, BC, CD) form the sides of the trapezoid.The trapezoid is formed by the intersection of these three lines and the fourth side DA. Let’s find the coordinates of the vertices A, B, C, D.First, find intersection of tangent lines at P and Q. The line AB is the tangent at P: y = -tx + ½t² + 2. The line BC is the tangent at Q: y = 2. Their intersection point B is where y = 2 intersects y = -tx + ½t² + 2. Setting 2 = -tx + ½t² + 2 → -tx + ½t² = 0 → x = (½t²)/t = t/2. So point B is (t/2, 2).Similarly, the line CD is the tangent at R: y = tx + ½t² + 2. It intersects BC (y = 2) at point C: 2 = tx + ½t² + 2 → tx + ½t² = 0 → x = -½t. So point C is (-½t, 2).Now, we need to find the fourth vertex D. The trapezoid is closed by side DA, which connects to point D. Since the trapezoid is symmetric, point D should be the reflection of point A across the y-axis. Let’s find point A.Point A is the intersection of tangent line AP (which is AB) and the fourth side DA. But we need to determine DA. However, since DA is the fourth side, it connects points D and A. But we need more information.Wait, actually, the trapezoid is formed by the three tangent lines and the line DA. However, DA is not specified. But since the trapezoid is isosceles and symmetric, DA should be the line connecting points A and D, which are the other intersections of the tangent lines with... Wait, perhaps points A and D are the intersections of the legs with the x-axis?Wait, let&#39;s see. The parabola is above the x-axis between -2 and 2, but at x = ±2, y = 0. So if DA is along the x-axis from (-2, 0) to (2, 0), then the trapezoid would have vertices at A(-2,0), B(t/2, 2), C(-t/2, 2), D(2,0). But we need to verify if the sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola.Wait, but in this case, AB is the line from (-2, 0) to (t/2, 2). Let&#39;s compute the equation of AB. The slope is (2 - 0)/(t/2 - (-2)) = 2/(t/2 + 2) = 4/(t + 4). The equation is y = [4/(t + 4)](x + 2).This line should be tangent to the parabola at point P(t, -½t² + 2). The equation of the tangent line at P is y = -tx + ½t² + 2. Therefore, these two equations should be the same. So:[4/(t + 4)](x + 2) = -tx + ½t² + 2Let’s check if these are equal for all x. Let’s substitute x = t into both sides:Left side: [4/(t + 4)](t + 2)Right side: -t*t + ½t² + 2 = -t² + ½t² + 2 = -½t² + 2Set them equal:[4(t + 2)]/(t + 4) = -½t² + 2Multiply both sides by (t + 4):4(t + 2) = (-½t² + 2)(t + 4)Expand the right side:-½t²(t) -½t²(4) + 2(t) + 2(4) = -½t³ - 2t² + 2t + 8Left side: 4t + 8Set equal:4t + 8 = -½t³ - 2t² + 2t + 8Subtract 4t + 8 from both sides:0 = -½t³ - 2t² - 2tMultiply both sides by -2:0 = t³ + 4t² + 4tFactor:t(t² + 4t + 4) = 0 =&gt; t(t + 2)^2 = 0Solutions: t = 0, t = -2But t = 0 would make the tangent line horizontal at (0, 2), which is the same as BC. But AB would be the line from (-2,0) to (0,2), slope 1, equation y = x + 2. But the tangent line at t=0 is y = 0x + 0 + 2 = y = 2, which is BC. So t=0 is invalid because AB and BC would coincide. t = -2 would place point P at (-2, -½*(-2)^2 + 2) = (-2, -2 + 2) = (-2, 0). The tangent line at t=-2 is y = -(-2)x + ½*(-2)^2 + 2 = 2x + 2 + 2 = 2x + 4. But point A is (-2, 0), plugging into the line: y = 2*(-2) + 4 = 0, which works. But this line is y=2x+4, which passes through (-2,0) and (t/2, 2) where t=-2, so (-1, 2). But then BC is from (-1,2) to (1,2), but t=-2 gives C at (-(-2)/2,2)=(1,2). Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe this approach isn&#39;t working.Alternatively, perhaps we need to parametrize the trapezoid based on the tangent lines. Let&#39;s consider the three tangent lines:1. Tangent at P(t, -½t² + 2): y = -tx + ½t² + 22. Tangent at Q(0,2): y = 23. Tangent at R(-t, -½t² + 2): y = tx + ½t² + 2These three lines form three sides of the trapezoid. The fourth side DA is missing. The vertices are the intersections of these lines. Let’s find the vertices:- Intersection of tangent at P and tangent at Q (point B):Set y = -tx + ½t² + 2 and y = 2:2 = -tx + ½t² + 2 → -tx + ½t² = 0 → x = ½tSo point B is (½t, 2)- Intersection of tangent at Q and tangent at R (point C):Set y = 2 and y = tx + ½t² + 2:2 = tx + ½t² + 2 → tx + ½t² = 0 → x = -½tSo point C is (-½t, 2)- Intersection of tangent at R and DA (point D):We need to determine DA. Since the trapezoid is closed, DA should connect the other two intersections. The fourth side DA connects point D to point A, which are the intersections of the tangent lines with... Wait, actually, after points B and C, the remaining vertices A and D must be the intersections of the tangent lines with the fourth side. However, since the trapezoid is supposed to be isosceles and symmetric, DA should be the line connecting points A and D, which are the intersections of the tangent lines at P and R with the x-axis, perhaps.Let’s find where the tangent lines at P and R meet the x-axis (y=0):For tangent line at P: y = -tx + ½t² + 2Set y=0:0 = -tx + ½t² + 2 → tx = ½t² + 2 → x = (½t² + 2)/t = (t/2) + 2/tSo point A is ((t/2) + 2/t, 0)Similarly, for tangent line at R: y = tx + ½t² + 2Set y=0:0 = tx + ½t² + 2 → tx = -½t² - 2 → x = (-½t² - 2)/t = -t/2 - 2/tSo point D is (-t/2 - 2/t, 0)Therefore, the vertices of the trapezoid are:A: ((t/2) + 2/t, 0)B: (½t, 2)C: (-½t, 2)D: (-t/2 - 2/t, 0)Now, we can compute the area of the trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is given by the average of the two bases multiplied by the height. In this case, the two bases are BC and DA.First, compute the lengths of BC and DA.Length of BC: distance between B (½t, 2) and C (-½t, 2) is |½t - (-½t)| = tLength of DA: distance between A ((t/2) + 2/t, 0) and D (-t/2 - 2/t, 0) is |(t/2 + 2/t) - (-t/2 - 2/t)| = |t/2 + 2/t + t/2 + 2/t| = |t + 4/t|The height of the trapezoid is the vertical distance between the bases BC and DA, which is 2 - 0 = 2.Wait, no. The height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. Since BC is at y=2 and DA is at y=0, the vertical distance is indeed 2. Therefore, the area is:Area = ½ * (length BC + length DA) * height = ½ * (t + |t + 4/t|) * 2 = (t + |t + 4/t|)But since t is a parameter related to the tangent lines, we need to consider the possible values of t.However, we must ensure that the points A and D lie within the interval [-2, 2] on the x-axis because the parabola is defined for x ∈ [-2, 2]. Therefore, the coordinates of A and D must satisfy:For point A: (t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2For point D: -t/2 - 2/t ≥ -2But due to symmetry, if point A is at x = (t/2) + 2/t, then point D is at x = - (t/2 + 2/t). Therefore, the conditions become:(t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2and- (t/2 + 2/t) ≥ -2 → t/2 + 2/t ≤ 2Which is the same as the first condition. Therefore, we need (t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2.Additionally, the tangent points P and R must lie on the parabola within x ∈ [-2, 2]. Since P is (t, -½t² + 2), we must have t ∈ [-2, 2]. But due to symmetry, we can assume t &gt; 0 (since negative t would correspond to the other side). So t ∈ (0, 2].So, our goal is to minimize the area:Area = t + (t + 4/t) = 2t + 4/tWait, hold on. Wait, length BC is t, length DA is t + 4/t (since |t + 4/t|, but t is positive, so it&#39;s t + 4/t). Wait, no:Wait, the length of DA is |(t/2 + 2/t) - (-t/2 - 2/t)| = |t + 4/t|. Since t is positive, this is t + 4/t.So Area = ½*(t + t + 4/t)*2 = (2t + 4/t)/2 * 2 = (t + 2/t)*2. Wait, no:Wait, the formula for the area is ½*(BC + DA)*height. BC length is t, DA length is t + 4/t, height is 2. So:Area = ½*(t + t + 4/t)*2 = (2t + 4/t)/2 * 2 = (t + 2/t)*2 = 2t + 4/tWait, no:Wait, ½*(base1 + base2)*height = ½*(t + (t + 4/t))*2 = ½*(2t + 4/t)*2 = (2t + 4/t)*1 = 2t + 4/tYes, correct.Therefore, Area = 2t + 4/tWe need to minimize this area with respect to t &gt; 0, subject to the constraint (t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2, and t ∈ (0, 2].Let’s first analyze the constraint:(t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2Multiply both sides by 2t (since t &gt; 0):t² + 4 ≤ 4tRearrange:t² - 4t + 4 ≤ 0Which factors as:(t - 2)^2 ≤ 0The square of a real number is always non-negative, so the only solution is t = 2.Therefore, the only value of t that satisfies the constraint is t = 2.But if t = 2, let&#39;s compute the area:Area = 2*2 + 4/2 = 4 + 2 = 6However, let&#39;s check if this makes sense. When t = 2:Point P is (2, -½*(4) + 2) = (2, -2 + 2) = (2, 0). So tangent at (2, 0). The tangent line at t=2 is y = -2x + ½*(4) + 2 = -2x + 2 + 2 = -2x + 4. This line should pass through point B (½*2, 2) = (1, 2). Check: y = -2*1 + 4 = 2. Correct. Then point A is ((2/2) + 2/2, 0) = (1 + 1, 0) = (2, 0). Similarly, point D is (-2, 0). Therefore, the trapezoid has vertices at A(2,0), B(1,2), C(-1,2), D(-2,0). The area would be:Bases BC: length 2 (from -1 to 1 on y=2), DA: length 4 (from -2 to 2 on y=0). Height is 2. Area = ½*(2 + 4)*2 = ½*6*2 = 6. Correct.But the problem states that three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent to the parabola. In this case, AB is from (2,0) to (1,2). The line AB is y = -2x + 4, which is tangent at (2,0). BC is y=2, tangent at (0,2). CD is from (-2,0) to (-1,2), line y = 2x + 4, tangent at (-2,0). So yes, three sides are tangent. But the area is 6. Is this the minimum?Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, the only t that satisfies the constraint is t=2. Therefore, the minimum area is 6? But let&#39;s check if there are other possibilities.Wait, but when we derived the constraint (t/2) + 2/t ≤ 2, we found that the only solution is t=2. Therefore, there&#39;s no other t in (0,2] that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the trapezoid with t=2 is the only possible one, giving area 6.But this seems counterintuitive. Maybe there&#39;s an error in the constraint.Wait, let&#39;s re-examine the constraint. The points A and D must lie within x ∈ [-2, 2]. For point A: x = t/2 + 2/t. We need t/2 + 2/t ≤ 2. Similarly, for point D: x = - (t/2 + 2/t) ≥ -2, which is equivalent to t/2 + 2/t ≤ 2. So the constraint is indeed t/2 + 2/t ≤ 2.But when we solved this inequality, we found t=2 is the only solution. Therefore, there&#39;s no other value of t in (0,2] that satisfies the constraint. Hence, the only possible trapezoid has t=2 and area 6.But wait, this trapezoid has DA from (-2,0) to (2,0), which is the same as the base of the parabola. The three sides AB, BC, CD are tangent at (2,0), (0,2), and (-2,0). But the points (2,0) and (-2,0) are the endpoints of the parabola. Therefore, the trapezoid in this case is actually a triangle because points A and D coincide with the endpoints of the parabola, and BC is the line y=2 from (-1,2) to (1,2). Wait, no, points A and D are at (2,0) and (-2,0), so the trapezoid is a quadrilateral with vertices at (-2,0), (2,0), (1,2), (-1,2). This is a trapezoid with bases of length 4 and 2, and height 2, area 6.But the problem asks for the minimum area. Is there a smaller area possible?But according to our analysis, due to the constraint, t can only be 2. Therefore, the minimum area is 6.But this seems strange. Let me verify with another approach.Alternative approach: Use optimization without parameterizing the trapezoid.The area of the trapezoid is ½*(sum of the two bases)*height. In our case, the two bases are BC and DA. BC is the top base, DA is the bottom base. The height is the vertical distance between them.Since BC is tangent to the parabola at (0,2), its equation is y=2. Therefore, BC is a horizontal line at y=2. The length of BC is 2h, where h is the horizontal distance from the y-axis to each end. The bottom base DA is the line segment from (-k,0) to (k,0), so its length is 2k. The height of the trapezoid is 2 units (from y=0 to y=2). Therefore, the area is ½*(2h + 2k)*2 = 2(h + k).To minimize the area, we need to minimize h + k, where h and k are related by the fact that the legs AB and CD are tangent to the parabola.The legs AB and CD are the lines connecting (-k,0) to (h,2) and (k,0) to (-h,2), respectively. These lines must be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2.Let&#39;s find the condition for the line connecting (-k,0) to (h,2) to be tangent to the parabola.The equation of line AB: passing through (-k,0) and (h,2).The slope is (2 - 0)/(h - (-k)) = 2/(h + k). The equation is y = [2/(h + k)](x + k)This line must be tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2. To find the condition for tangency, set the equations equal and set the discriminant to zero.Substitute y from the line into the parabola:[2/(h + k)](x + k) = -½x² + 2Multiply both sides by (h + k):2(x + k) = -½x²(h + k) + 2(h + k)Rearrange:½x²(h + k) + 2x + 2k - 2(h + k) = 0Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:x²(h + k) + 4x + 4k - 4(h + k) = 0Simplify:x²(h + k) + 4x + 4k - 4h - 4k = 0So:x²(h + k) + 4x - 4h = 0This quadratic equation must have exactly one solution, so discriminant D = 0.Discriminant D = 16 - 4*(h + k)*(-4h) = 16 + 16h(h + k)Set D = 0:16 + 16h(h + k) = 0 → 1 + h(h + k) = 0 → h(h + k) = -1But h and k are lengths, so h &gt; 0 and k &gt; 0. Therefore, h(h + k) = -1 is impossible. This suggests an error in the derivation.Wait, where did I go wrong?Let me re-derive the discriminant.The quadratic equation after substitution is:x²(h + k) + 4x - 4h = 0General form: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = h + k, b = 4, c = -4hDiscriminant D = b² - 4ac = 16 - 4*(h + k)*(-4h) = 16 + 16h(h + k)Set D = 0:16 + 16h(h + k) = 0 → 1 + h(h + k) = 0Which as before, implies h(h + k) = -1. But since h and k are positive, this is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution, which contradicts our previous result where t=2 gave a valid trapezoid. This suggests a mistake in the current approach.Wait, in the previous parameterization with t, we found that the only solution was t=2, which corresponds to h=1 and k=2. Because when t=2, h=1 (point B at (1,2)), and k=2 (point A at (2,0)). Therefore, h=1 and k=2, so h + k = 3. The area was 2*(h + k)=6. However, according to the discriminant condition here, h(h + k)=1*(1 + 2)=3 ≠ -1. There&#39;s a contradiction.This suggests that the two approaches are not aligned. There must be a mistake somewhere.Wait, going back to the previous parameterization, when t=2, the quadratic equation in x was:From earlier steps, after setting the line AB (y = [2/(h + k)](x + k)) equal to the parabola:We had the quadratic equation: (h + k)x² + 4x - 4h = 0For t=2, h=1, k=2, so the equation becomes:(1 + 2)x² + 4x - 4*1 = 3x² + 4x -4 =0Discriminant D = 16 + 48 = 64, which is positive, indicating two solutions. But we expected a tangent line, which should have D=0.This suggests that there is a fundamental error in the previous assumption that when t=2, the line is tangent. But when t=2, the line AB is y = -2x + 4, which is tangent at (2,0). Let&#39;s verify this.The line y = -2x + 4. To check if it&#39;s tangent to the parabola y = -½x² + 2, set them equal:-2x + 4 = -½x² + 2 → -½x² + 2x + 2 - 4 = 0 → -½x² + 2x - 2 = 0 → Multiply by -2: x² - 4x + 4 = 0 → (x - 2)^2 = 0 → x=2. So yes, it&#39;s tangent at x=2. Therefore, discriminant is zero. Therefore, there&#39;s a mistake in the previous general discriminant calculation.Wait, when we derived the discriminant for the general case, we arrived at D = 16 + 16h(h + k). But in the specific case where h=1, k=2, we have D = 16 + 16*1*(1 + 2)=16 + 48=64, which contradicts the specific case where discriminant is zero. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in Grid: The sum of a row or column is even if there are an even number of odd numbers.

k} b^{k}。这里，a是sqrt{x}，b是2，m是2n+1。所以展开后的每一项应该是binom{2n+1}{k} (sqrt{x})^{2n+1 -k} cdot 2^{k}。接下来，我需要确定每一项中x的指数是否为整数。首先，每一项中的x的指数来自于(sqrt{x})^{2n+1 -k}，也就是x^{frac{2n+1 -k}{2}}。为了让这个指数是整数，即frac{2n+1 -k}{2}必须是整数。也就是说，分子2n+1 -k必须是偶数，这样才能被2整除，得到一个整数指数。所以，条件就是2n+1 -k是偶数。等价于，k ≡ (2n+1) mod 2。因为2n是偶数，所以2n+1是奇数，所以k ≡ 1 mod 2，即k必须是奇数吗？或者可能反过来？让我再仔细检查一下。因为2n+1 -k要是偶数，所以可以写成2n+1 -k = 2m，其中m是整数。那么解得k = 2n+1 - 2m。这说明k的奇偶性取决于2n+1 -2m的奇偶性。因为2m是偶数，所以2n+1是奇数，减去偶数还是奇数，所以k必须是奇数。因此，只有当k为奇数时，对应的项中的x的指数才是整数。或者，换一种方式思考：如果2n+1 -k是偶数，则因为2n+1是奇数，所以奇数减去k是偶数，这意味着k必须是奇数，因为奇数减奇数等于偶数，而奇数减偶数等于奇数。所以只有当k是奇数的时候，2n+1 -k才是偶数，这样x的指数才是整数。因此，在展开式中，只有当k为奇数时，对应的项才有整数幂次的x，这样的项的系数应该被包括在总和中。所以，现在的问题转化为，在展开式中，所有k为奇数的项的系数之和是多少。也就是说，需要计算sum_{k text{ 奇数}} binom{2n+1}{k} 2^{k}。接下来，我需要找到这个和的值。这里可能需要用到二项式定理中的奇偶项求和技巧。通常，可以考虑代入特定的值来分离奇偶项。比如，对于一般的二项式展开式(a + b)^m，奇数次项的系数和可以通过(a + b)^m - (a - b)^m除以2来得到，而偶数次项的系数和则是两者之和除以2。不过在这里，我们的变量并不是简单的x，而是里面的项可能涉及sqrt{x}，所以可能需要调整思路。不过，这里的系数之和其实是针对所有符合条件的项，而这里的项中的x的指数已经被处理过了，我们只关心系数，也就是当x的指数是整数时的那些项的系数之和。或者更准确地说，题目中的“系数”应该指的是这些项中的系数，不管x的指数是多少，只要指数是整数，就取它们的系数相加。所以，可能更简单的方法是将x设为1，这样原来的表达式中的每一项都会变成其系数乘以1的某个幂次，也就是系数本身。不过，此时需要满足x的幂次是整数的情况下，才能被计入总和。不过这可能有点矛盾，因为当x设为1时，不管原来的幂次是否整数，所有项的值都会变成系数乘以1，所以总和就是整个展开式在x=1时的值，即(1^{1/2} + 2)^{2n+1} = (1 + 2)^{2n+1} = 3^{2n+1}。但题目并不是要求所有项的和，而是只考虑那些x的指数是整数的项的和。因此，直接代入x=1可能不对，因为这样会把所有项的系数都加起来，包括那些x的指数不是整数的项。所以，我需要另一种方法。可能的方法是将x设为1，然后减去那些x的指数为非整数项的和。或者，考虑使用生成函数的方法，通过某种方式过滤出那些满足条件的项。或者，回到原来的思路，当k是奇数时，项中的x的指数是整数。因此，这些项的系数之和就是当x=1时这些项的值之和。但问题是，如何分离出这些项？另一种想法，可能引入复数单位根或者利用奇偶函数来分离这些项。例如，当展开式中，对于所有k为奇数的情况，可以利用函数f(x) = (sqrt{x} + 2)^{2n+1}，然后计算某种组合，比如[f(1) + f(-1)] / 2或者类似的方法来分离奇偶项。不过这里的变量是sqrt{x}，而x本身可能只能取非负实数，所以当x=1时，代入没问题，但x=-1的话，根号下x就没有实数意义，可能得考虑复数的情况。不过这可能会让问题复杂化。或者，或许可以做一个变量替换，令y = sqrt{x}，那么原式变为(y + 2)^{2n+1}，而原来的问题转化为在这个展开式中，寻找那些项中的y的指数是偶数的情况，因为原来的x的整数次幂对应于y的偶数次幂。比如，x的整数次幂是y^2的整数次幂，即y^(2m)，所以在展开式中，所有y的指数是偶数的项的系数之和就是题目所要求的。所以，现在问题转化为：在(y + 2)^{2n+1}的展开式中，求所有y的指数为偶数的项的系数之和。这时候，就可以使用标准的奇偶项分离的方法了。对于多项式(y + 2)^{2n+1}，其所有偶数次项的和可以用[f(1) + f(-1)] / 2来计算，其中f(y) = (y + 2)^{2n+1}。当y=1时，f(1) = (1 + 2)^{2n+1} = 3^{2n+1}，而f(-1) = (-1 + 2)^{2n+1} = 1^{2n+1} = 1。因此，偶数次项的和就是(3^{2n+1} + 1)/2。而对应的，这些项的系数之和也就是这个值，因为当y=1时，每个项的系数乘以1的相应幂次，即系数本身的和。因此，回到原来的问题，这里的系数之和就是(3^{2n+1} + 1)/2。不过，我需要验证这个结论是否正确，或者是否有哪里出错了。让我再检查一遍步骤：1. 原式(sqrt{x} + 2)^{2n+1}，设y = sqrt(x)，则表达式变为(y + 2)^{2n+1}。2. 题目要求的是在展开式中，x的整数次幂的项的系数之和，即y的偶数次幂的项的系数之和。3. 因此，求(y + 2)^{2n+1}中y的偶次项的系数和，这可以用代入y=1和y=-1后的平均值来得到：(f(1) + f(-1))/2 = (3^{2n+1} + 1)/2。因此，答案应该是(3^{2n+1} + 1)/2，也就是frac{3^{2n+1} + 1}{2}。不过，我需要确认这个推导是否正确。尤其是变量替换这一步是否存在问题。比如，原来的问题中，当y = sqrt(x)，那么x的整数次幂对应于y的偶数次幂，这没错。因此，在展开式中，当寻找x^k（k为整数）的项时，对应的是y^{2k}，即y的偶数次项。因此，这些项的系数之和确实等于在(y + 2)^{2n+1}中所有y的偶次项的系数之和。因此，通过代入y=1和y=-1后的平均值得到的答案是正确的。因此，结论应该是正确的，即所求的和是(3^{2n+1} + 1)/2。不过，为了进一步验证，可以尝试代入具体的n值，看是否成立。例如，当n=0时，原式是(sqrt{x} + 2)^{1}，展开式就是sqrt{x} + 2。此时，整数次幂的x项是常数项2（即x^0），而另一项是x^{1/2}，不是整数次幂，所以系数之和是2。而根据公式，(3^{1} +1)/2 = (3 +1)/2 = 2，确实正确。再试n=1，此时指数是3，即(sqrt{x} + 2)^3的展开式是：binom{3}{0}(sqrt{x})^3 2^0 + binom{3}{1}(sqrt{x})^2 2^1 + binom{3}{2}(sqrt{x})^1 2^2 + binom{3}{3}(sqrt{x})^0 2^3即：1 * x^{3/2} + 3 * x^{1} * 2 + 3 * x^{1/2} * 4 + 1 * 1 * 8= x^{3/2} + 6x + 12x^{1/2} + 8其中，整数次幂的项是6x（x^1）和8（x^0），所以系数之和是6 + 8 = 14。根据公式，(3^{3} +1)/2 = (27 +1)/2 = 28/2 = 14，确实正确。再试n=2，指数是5，展开式比较复杂，但根据公式，和应该是(3^5 +1)/2 = (243 +1)/2 = 244/2 = 122。不过手动展开可能比较麻烦，但可以相信之前的验证是正确的。因此，可以确定答案是正确的，即系数之和为frac{3^{2n+1} + 1}{2}。&lt;/think&gt;你将遇到一个问题。请逐步思考，并将最终答案放在boxed{}中：7. 在展开式(sqrt{x} + 2)^{2n+1}中，含有x的整数次幂的项的系数之和为保留源文本的换行和格式，直接输出翻译结果。为了求解(sqrt{x} + 2)^{2n+1}的展开式中整数次幂项的系数和，首先利用二项式定理展开：(sqrt{x} + 2)^{2n+1} = sum_{k=0}^{2n+1} binom{2n+1}{k} (sqrt{x})^{2n+1-k} cdot 2^k.其中，每一项的x的指数为frac{2n+1-k}{2}。为使指数为整数，需满足2n+1 -k为偶数，即k为奇数。接下来，通过变量替换y = sqrt{x}，原式变为(y + 2)^{2n+1}。此时，整数次幂项对应y的偶数次幂项。利用奇偶项分离法，偶数次项的和为：frac{f(1) + f(-1)}{2} = frac{(1+2)^{2n+1} + (-1+2)^{2n+1}}{2} = frac{3^{2n+1} + 1}{2}.验证实例：- 当n=0时，展开式为sqrt{x} + 2，整数次幂项系数和为2，公式结果为frac{3^1 +1}{2} = 2，一致。- 当n=1时，展开式为x^{3/2} + 6x + 12x^{1/2} + 8，整数次幂项系数和为6 + 8 = 14，公式结果为frac{3^3 +1}{2} = 14，一致。因此，所求系数之和为：boxed{dfrac{3^{2n+1} + 1}{2}}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-37986e25></div><p class="review-content" data-v-37986e25><span class="icon" data-v-37986e25>🔑:</span>(sqrt{x}+2)^{2 n+1}=sum_{k=0}^{2 n+1} C_{2 n+1}^{k}(sqrt{x})^{2 n+1-k} cdot 2^{k}, thus k is odd.Let A=C_{2 n+1}^{1} cdot 2+C_{2 n+1}^{3} cdot 2^{3}+cdots+C_{2 n+1}^{2 n+1} cdot 2^{2 n+1},B=C_{2 n+1}^{0} cdot 2^{0}+C_{2 n+1}^{2} cdot 2^{2}+cdots+C_{2 n+1}^{2 n+1} cdot 2^{2 n}.Then left{begin{array}{l}B+A=(1+2)^{2 n+1},  B-A=(1-2)^{2 n+1}end{array} Rightarrow 2 A=3^{2 n+1}+1 Rightarrow A=frac{3^{2 n+1}+1}{2}right..</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-e60bd32c><span data-v-e60bd32c>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
