So, we have a circle with n ≥ 3 points, each colored red, green, or blue. The operation allowed is to erase two neighboring points of different colors and replace them with a new point of the third color. The goal is to find all n for which there exists an initial state missing one color, such that we can end up with all points being the same color (any of the three) through some sequence of operations. First, I need to understand the operation. Let&#39;s break it down. If we have two adjacent points of different colors, say red and green, we remove them and insert a blue point. Similarly, if it&#39;s green and blue, we insert red, and if it&#39;s blue and red, we insert green. The key here is that each operation reduces the number of points by one. So starting with n points, each step reduces n by 1, until we get down to 1 point. The color of that final point is the color of the final state.But the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour,&quot; which is a bit confusing because if we end with one point, that&#39;s trivial. Wait, maybe the process continues until all remaining points are the same color. But if there are two points left, they can be merged only if they are different colors, resulting in the third color. So, actually, the process stops when all remaining points are the same color. So depending on the parity of n, perhaps? Let&#39;s see. If n is even, maybe we can reduce it to 1, but if n is odd, maybe we can&#39;t? Wait, no, actually, each step reduces the number of points by one, so starting from n, you can go down to 1 if n is odd, but if n is even, you can only go down to 2. Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s think step by step.If n=3: you can perform one operation, reducing it to 2 points. Then, if those two are different colors, you can perform another operation, reducing it to 1 point. If they are the same color, you stop. Wait, but the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour,&quot; so if you have two points left of the same color, that&#39;s the final state. If they are different, you can merge them into the third color, resulting in one point. So actually, the process can end either when all points are the same color, which could be at 1 point or at 2 points if they are the same color. Hmm, but the problem states &quot;all marked points have the same colour which is called the colour of the final state.&quot; So if you have two points left of the same color, that&#39;s acceptable. But if you have two points of different colors, you must continue until you have one point. So the final state is either one point or multiple points all of the same color.Wait, but the problem says &quot;In a final state, all marked points have the same colour,&quot; so if you have two points, they must both be the same color. Therefore, for even n, the process must end when you have two points of the same color, and for odd n, you can reduce down to one point. Therefore, depending on n, the final state is either one point (if n is odd) or two points of the same color (if n is even). But wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me check.Suppose n=4. Start with four points. If you perform an operation, you get three points. Then, if those three can be reduced to two points, and so on. Wait, so actually, regardless of starting with n, each operation reduces the number of points by one. Therefore, starting from n, you can perform operations until you have one point if n is odd, or two points if n is even. But how can you end up with two points? Let&#39;s take n=4. Suppose you have four points. After one operation, you have three. Then another operation, you have two. If those two are different, you can perform another operation to get one. But if they are the same, you stop. So actually, the process can terminate at two points if they are the same color. Therefore, the number of points in the final state depends on whether the last two points can be merged or not. If they are the same color, you stop; if different, you merge them into the third color.Therefore, the final state is either one point (if after merging pairs until you get to two different colors, then merging those) or two points of the same color (if at some point you have two same-colored points left). Hmm, but the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour,&quot; so if you have two points, they must both be the same color, otherwise you can merge them. So actually, the final state is when all remaining points are the same color, so the number of points can be 1 or 2. But to have two points, they must be the same color. If they are different, you have to merge them into one.Therefore, the final state is either one point or two points of the same color, depending on whether n is odd or even. Wait, but n can be both odd or even. Let me see.Wait, for example, n=3 (odd). Start with three points. Perform two operations: first merging two points to get two, then if they are different, merge them to get one. If the first merge gives two of the same color, then you already stop at two points. But if the first merge gives two different colors, then you can merge again. So for n=3, the final state could be one or two points. Wait, but the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour,&quot; so if you have two points, they must be the same color. So in the case of n=3, depending on the operations, you can end up with either two same-colored points or one point. Therefore, the final color could be different based on the operations taken.But the problem states that the initial state is missing one color. So, for example, suppose the initial state has only red and green. Then, through operations, can we reach a final state of any color (red, green, or blue)? The missing color is blue in this case, so is it possible?Wait, but blue is not present in the initial state, so how can we end up with a blue final state? Because whenever we merge two different colors (red and green), we get blue. So if we have an initial state with only red and green, then through operations, we can create blue. So maybe it&#39;s possible. Let&#39;s take an example.Suppose n=3, arranged as red, green, red. Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s label them positions 1, 2, 3. So 1: red, 2: green, 3: red. If we merge 1 and 2 (red and green), we get blue at position 1-2, resulting in two points: blue and red. Then, we have blue and red. They are different, so we merge them to get green. So the final color is green. Alternatively, if we first merge 2 and 3 (green and red), we get blue, resulting in blue and red. Then merge them to get green again. Alternatively, if we first merge 3 and 1 (red and red). Wait, but they are the same color; we can&#39;t merge them. So the only possible merges are between different colors. So in the initial configuration of red, green, red, the only possible merges are between red and green. So regardless of the order, we end up with green as the final color. Hmm. So in this case, even though we started with red and green, the final color is green. But we wanted to reach any of the three colors. So maybe this initial state is not sufficient.Alternatively, maybe a different initial state. Suppose n=3 with red, green, green. Let&#39;s try. Merge red and green (positions 1 and 2) to get blue. Now we have blue and green. Merge them to get red. So final color is red. Alternatively, merge positions 2 and 3 (green and green) can&#39;t. So only possible merge is positions 1 and 2. So again, same result. Alternatively, if initial state is red, green, blue. Wait, but the initial state is supposed to be missing one color. So in this case, we have all three colors, which is not allowed. The problem says &quot;one missing colour&quot;.So for n=3, the initial state must have two colors. Let&#39;s say red and green. But in the previous example, starting with red, green, red, we ended up with green. Starting with red, green, green, we ended up with red. So depending on the initial configuration, maybe we can get different final colors. Wait, but in the first case (R, G, R), merging the first two gives blue, then merging blue and red gives green. In the second case (R, G, G), merging R and G gives blue, then blue and G gives red. So actually, the final color depends on the number of each color initially. Let me count the number of each color modulo something.This seems like an invariant problem. Maybe we can assign a value to each color and track it modulo some number. For example, let&#39;s assign weights to the colors. Let&#39;s say red=0, green=1, blue=2 modulo 3. Then, when we perform an operation: merging two different colors, say a and b, we replace them with (a + b + 1) mod 3? Wait, because if we have two colors, a and b, and replace them with the third color c, then c = (a + b + 1) mod 3? Wait, let&#39;s see.If a and b are different, then the third color is determined. For example, red (0) and green (1) merge to blue (2). 0 + 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, green (1) and blue (2) merge to red (0): 1 + 2 +1 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 3. Blue (2) and red (0) merge to green (1): 2 + 0 +1 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3? Wait, that doesn&#39;t hold. Wait, maybe another formula.Alternatively, think of the colors as elements of the cyclic group Z/3Z. Let’s say red=0, green=1, blue=2. When you merge two colors a and b, where a ≠ b, you get the third color c = - (a + b) mod 3. Because 0 and 1 give 2 (which is -(0+1)= -1 ≡ 2 mod 3). 1 and 2 give 0 (which is -(1+2)= -3 ≡ 0 mod 3). 2 and 0 give 1 (which is -(2+0)= -2 ≡ 1 mod 3). Yes, this works. So the operation replaces a and b with c = -(a + b) mod 3.Therefore, each operation replaces two colors a and b (a ≠ b) with c = -(a + b). So maybe we can find an invariant here. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we consider the sum of all colors modulo 3. Let&#39;s compute the sum before and after the operation. Let’s say before merging, we have two colors a and b. The sum is S = a + b + rest. After merging, we replace a and b with c = -(a + b). So the new sum is S&#39; = c + rest = -(a + b) + rest = S - (a + b) - (a + b) = S - 2(a + b). Wait, but modulo 3, this is S + ( -2(a + b) ) mod 3. But this is not a straightforward invariant. However, maybe if we consider a different weighting.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the sum modulo 2. Let’s assign red=0, green=1, blue=1. Then, when merging two different colors:- If we merge 0 and 1, we get 1 (blue=1). The sum changes from 0 + 1 to 1. So 1 = 0 + 1 (mod 2). Wait, sum remains the same. Hmm.Wait, if we assign red=0, green=1, blue=1, then merging red and green (0 and 1) gives blue (1). The sum before was 0 + 1 = 1, after it&#39;s 1, so same. Merging green and blue (1 and 1) can&#39;t happen because they are same. Merging blue and red (1 and 0) same as red and green. So sum modulo 2 is preserved. But this might not help.Alternatively, another approach: think of the parity of the number of points. Each operation reduces the number of points by 1. So the parity changes each time. Starting from n, after k operations, the number of points is n - k. The process stops when all points are the same color. For n odd, we can go down to 1 point. For n even, the minimum is 2 points (if they are same color) or 1 point (if they are merged from 2 different colors). Therefore, the final number of points is 1 if we can perform n - 1 operations, which is possible only if during the process, we never get stuck with two points of the same color before.But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, think in terms of possible final colors.Given that the initial state is missing one color, say blue. So all points are red or green. The problem asks for which n there exists such an initial configuration (with one color missing) from which we can reach any final color (red, green, or blue). So, starting with only red and green, can we end up with red, green, or blue? Similarly, if we start with red and blue, can we end up with any color, etc. But the problem states &quot;one missing colour&quot;, so the initial state is missing one of the three. So we need an initial state missing one color, such that depending on the operations, we can end up with any of the three colors. Let’s consider small n first.n=3: The minimal case. Suppose we have two colors, say red and green. The circle has three points. Let&#39;s take R, G, R. As before, merging R and G gives B, leading to B and R, then merging gives G. Alternatively, could we get a different color? If we have R, G, G. Merging R and G gives B, leading to B and G, then merging gives R. So depending on the initial arrangement, maybe the final color can be different. Wait, but in the first case, R, G, R leads to G. In the second case, R, G, G leads to R. But can we get blue?Wait, if we have three points: R, G, B. But that has all three colors, which is not allowed (since initial state must miss one color). So if we start with two colors, say R and G, can we ever get blue as the final color? Let&#39;s see. Suppose we have three points: R, G, R. Merge the first two (R and G) to get B. Now we have B and R. Merge them to get G. So final color is G. Alternatively, if we first merge the last two (G and R), same result. So we can&#39;t get blue. Hmm.Alternatively, what if we have four points? Let&#39;s try n=4. Suppose we have R, G, R, G. Let&#39;s try merging the first two (R and G) to get B. Now we have B, R, G. Then merge R and G to get B. Now we have B, B. Since they are the same color, we stop. Final color is B. Alternatively, merge B and R: but they are different, so merging B and R would give G. Then G and B: merge to R. Wait, but with four points, starting with R, G, R, G.First step: merge positions 1 and 2 (R, G) → B. Now positions: B, R, G. Then merge positions 2 and 3 (R, G) → B. Now positions: B, B. So final color is B. Alternatively, first merge positions 2 and 3 (G, R) → B. Then positions: R, B, G. Then merge R and B → G. Then G and G, stop. Final color G. Wait, so depending on the merges, can we get different colors?Wait, starting with R, G, R, G. If we first merge 1-2 (R, G → B), then 2-3 (R, G → B), resulting in B, B. Final color B. Alternatively, first merge 3-4 (R, G → B). Then positions: R, G, B. Then merge 1-2 (R, G → B). Then positions: B, B. Final color B. Wait, maybe only B is possible here. Alternatively, is there a way to get R or G?Wait, another approach: merge 1-2 (R, G → B), then merge 1-2 (B, R → G). Then positions: G, G. So final color G. Oh, right! So starting with R, G, R, G:1. Merge positions 1-2: R, G → B. Now [B, R, G].2. Merge positions 1-2: B, R → G. Now [G, G].3. Final color G.Alternatively:1. Merge positions 2-3: G, R → B. Now [R, B, G].2. Merge positions 2-3: B, G → R. Now [R, R].3. Final color R.Wait, so depending on the order of operations, starting from R, G, R, G, we can get final colors R, G, or B. For example:To get R:- Merge positions 2-3 (G, R → B)- Merge positions 2-3 (B, G → R)- Result: R, R.To get G:- Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B)- Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G)- Result: G, G.To get B:- Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B)- Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B)- Result: B, B.So for n=4, starting with R, G, R, G (missing blue), we can reach any final color. Therefore, n=4 is a candidate.Similarly, n=3: we saw that starting with two colors, you can&#39;t get the third color as the final state. For example, starting with R, G, R, you can only get G. Starting with R, G, G, you can only get R. So n=3 doesn&#39;t work. What about n=5?Let&#39;s try n=5. Suppose we have an initial configuration missing one color, say blue. Let&#39;s have R, G, R, G, R. Let&#39;s see if we can reach all three colors.First, try to get blue. Let&#39;s merge neighboring pairs:1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). Now [B, R, G, R].2. Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B). Now [B, B, R].3. Merge positions 1-2 (B, B → cannot merge). Hmm, stuck. Alternatively, after step 1: [B, R, G, R].4. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). Now [B, R, B].5. Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). Now [G, B].6. Merge positions 1-2 (G, B → R). Final color R.Alternatively, different steps:1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R]2. Merge positions 4-5 (R, R → cannot merge). So merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [B, R, B]3. Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, B]4. Merge to get R. So final color R.Alternatively, starting with R, G, R, G, R.Try to get green:1. Merge positions 5-1 (R, R → cannot merge). So must merge different colors.Let&#39;s merge positions 2-3 (G, R → B). [R, B, G, R]2. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [R, B, B]3. Merge positions 1-2 (R, B → G). [G, B]4. Merge to get R. Hmm, same as before.Alternatively, merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R]Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, G, R]Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [G, B]Merge to get R. Again, final color R.Wait, is it possible to get green or blue? Let&#39;s try again.Starting with R, G, R, G, R.1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R]2. Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B). [B, B, R]3. Merge positions 1-2 (B, B → cannot merge). Merge positions 3-4 (B, R → G). [B, G]4. Merge to get R. Still R.Alternatively:1. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [R, G, B, R]2. Merge positions 2-3 (G, B → R). [R, R, R]3. All Rs. Final color R.Hmm, seems like regardless of the operations, starting with R, G, R, G, R (n=5), we can only get R or maybe G? Wait, let&#39;s try another approach.1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R]2. Merge positions 4-5 (R, R → cannot merge). Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [B, R, B]3. Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, B]4. Merge to get R. Still R.Alternatively, start merging different pairs.1. Merge positions 2-3 (G, R → B). [R, B, G, R]2. Merge positions 1-2 (R, B → G). [G, G, R]3. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [G, B]4. Merge to get R.No luck getting green or blue. Hmm. So maybe for n=5, starting with two colors, you can only get one of the initial colors or the third color? But in our attempts, we only got R or G. Wait, in the first example, after merging steps, we ended up with B, B, R, then merged B and R to get G, then G and B to get R. So maybe the parity is important.Wait, perhaps for odd n, starting with two colors, you can only reach certain colors. Maybe related to the number of each color modulo something. Let&#39;s go back to the invariant idea.Suppose we assign numerical values to the colors: red=0, green=1, blue=2 mod 3. When two colors a and b are merged, they become c = -(a + b) mod 3. Let&#39;s consider the sum of all colors mod 3. Let’s see how it changes.Suppose before merging, the sum is S. After merging two colors a and b, the new sum is S - a - b + c = S - a - b - (a + b) = S - 2a - 2b. So the new sum is S - 2(a + b) mod 3. This is different from the original sum. Therefore, the sum mod 3 is not preserved. So maybe it&#39;s not an invariant.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the sum mod 2. If we assign red=0, green=1, blue=1. Then merging two different colors (say 0 and 1) gives 1. The sum changes from 0 + 1 = 1 to 1. So preserved. If we merge 1 and 0, same. Merging 1 and 1 is not allowed. So for this assignment, sum mod 2 is preserved. Therefore, the parity of the number of 1s (green and blue) is preserved. Wait, but in this case, green and blue are both 1. So if we start with only red (0) and green (1), then the sum mod 2 is the number of green points mod 2. Since blue is not present initially, and blue is considered as 1, but we don&#39;t have any. Wait, maybe this approach is confusing.Alternatively, another invariant. Suppose we define the total number of color changes around the circle. For example, in a circle of alternating red and green, the number of color changes is n. But when you merge two points, you replace two colors with one, which may affect the number of color changes. Not sure if this helps.Alternatively, think in terms of transformations. Each operation can be considered as replacing two adjacent different colors with the third. This resembles a kind of transformation rule similar to those in some combinatorial games. Maybe there&#39;s a way to model this as a system of transformations and see which final states are reachable.But perhaps stepping back, the problem is asking for n where there exists an initial state missing one color, such that through operations, you can reach any of the three colors. From the n=4 example, we saw that it&#39;s possible. For n=3, not possible. Let&#39;s check n=5. If we can find an initial configuration where starting from two colors, we can reach any third color, then n=5 is possible. Otherwise, not.Alternatively, maybe the key is that n must be even. Because in the n=4 case, which is even, we could reach any color. For n=3 (odd), we couldn&#39;t. Similarly, n=5 (odd) also seems problematic. Let&#39;s test n=6.Suppose n=6 with alternating red and green: R, G, R, G, R, G. Let&#39;s see if we can reach all three colors.To get blue:1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). Now [B, R, G, R, G].2. Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B). [B, B, R, G].3. Merge positions 3-4 (R, G → B). [B, B, B].4. Final color B.To get green:1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R, G].2. Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, G, R, G].3. Merge positions 3-4 (R, G → B). [G, G, B].4. Merge positions 1-2 (G, G → cannot merge). Merge positions 3-4 (B, G → R). [G, G, R].5. Merge positions 1-2 (G, G → cannot merge). Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [G, B].6. Merge to get R. Hmm, didn&#39;t get green.Wait, maybe a different approach.Starting with R, G, R, G, R, G.To get green:1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R, G].2. Merge positions 5-6 (G, R → B). [B, R, G, B].3. Merge positions 3-4 (G, B → R). [B, R, R].4. Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, R].5. Merge to get B. Not green.Alternatively:1. Merge positions 2-3 (G, R → B). [R, B, G, R, G].2. Merge positions 4-5 (R, G → B). [R, B, G, B].3. Merge positions 1-2 (R, B → G). [G, G, B].4. Merge positions 3-4 (G, B → R). [G, R].5. Merge to get B. Still not green.Hmm, maybe it&#39;s not straightforward. Alternatively, start by merging different pairs.1. Merge positions 1-2 (R, G → B). [B, R, G, R, G].2. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [B, R, B, G].3. Merge positions 2-3 (R, B → G). [B, G, G].4. Merge positions 1-2 (B, G → R). [R, G].5. Merge to get B. Still ends with B or R.Wait, maybe it&#39;s not possible to get green for n=6. Or maybe my approach is wrong.Alternatively, perhaps the key is that for even n, you can reach any color, but for odd n, you can&#39;t. Wait, but in n=4, which is even, we could reach any color. For n=6, maybe it&#39;s also possible but requires a different strategy.Alternatively, maybe the answer is all even n ≥ 4. But the problem states n ≥ 3. So possible answers: all even integers n ≥ 4.But let&#39;s check n=5 again. Suppose we have a different initial configuration. For example, three reds and two greens arranged alternately: R, G, R, G, R. But we tried that earlier and couldn&#39;t get blue. Alternatively, four reds and one green: R, R, R, R, G. Let&#39;s try.1. Merge positions 4-5 (R, G → B). [R, R, R, B].2. Merge positions 3-4 (R, B → G). [R, R, G].3. Merge positions 1-2 (R, R → cannot merge). Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B). [R, B].4. Merge to get G. Final color G.Alternatively, merge positions 5-1 (G, R → B). [B, R, R, R].Merge positions 1-2 (B, R → G). [G, R, R].Merge positions 1-2 (G, R → B). [B, R].Merge to get G. Again, G.But starting with four R and one G, maybe we can only get G or B? Not sure.Alternatively, if we start with a different configuration, like R, R, G, G, R.1. Merge positions 3-4 (G, G → cannot merge). Merge positions 2-3 (R, G → B). [R, B, G, R].2. Merge positions 1-2 (R, B → G). [G, G, R].3. Merge positions 3-4 (G, R → B). [G, B].4. Merge to get R. So final color R.Alternatively, merge positions 4-5 (R, R → cannot merge). Merge positions 1-2 (R, R → cannot merge). So stuck.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a pattern based on parity. Let&#39;s think back to the invariant.If we assign weights to the colors and find something preserved modulo some number. Let&#39;s try modulo 2.Suppose red=0, green=1, blue=1. As before, merging different colors preserves the sum modulo 2. If the initial sum is S mod 2, then any final color must have S mod 2. For example, if we start with two colors: red and green. The sum is the number of greens (since red=0, green=1). If the number of greens is even, the sum is 0 mod 2; if odd, sum is 1 mod 2. The final color must be 0 or 1, depending on the sum. If the final state is one point, its color is 0 or 1. If it&#39;s two points, they must be the same color, so sum is 0 or 2 ≡ 0 mod 2. Wait, but two points of color 1 would sum to 2 ≡ 0 mod 2. So the parity of the sum must be preserved.Wait, if we start with an even number of greens (sum 0 mod 2), the final color must be 0 (red) or two 1s (green or blue), which sum to 0 mod 2. If we start with an odd number of greens (sum 1 mod 2), the final color must be 1 (green or blue) or a single 1. Therefore, the final color&#39;s parity is determined by the initial sum.But the problem requires that we can reach any final color. However, if we start with a sum that&#39;s 0 mod 2, we can&#39;t reach a final color with sum 1 mod 2. For example, if we start with two greens (sum 0), the final color must be red or two greens/blues. So to get blue (which is 1), which has parity 1, it&#39;s impossible. Similarly, starting with an odd number of greens, you can&#39;t get red.Therefore, if the initial configuration has a certain parity, you can only reach final colors with the same parity. Since blue is considered as 1 (same as green), starting with red and green (which have parities 0 and 1), the number of greens determines the parity. If we have an even number of greens, we can only end with red or two greens/blues (which sum to 0). If we have an odd number of greens, we can end with green/blue or one green/blue.But the problem requires that from an initial state missing one color, we can reach any of the three colors. However, due to the parity invariant, we cannot. For example, if we start with red and green, and an even number of greens, we cannot reach blue (which is parity 1). Wait, but blue is parity 1, and if we have an even number of greens (parity 0), but when we merge red and green, we get blue, which is parity 1. Wait, but does the total parity change?Wait, no. Let me clarify. The invariant is the sum modulo 2. If we start with sum S, and each operation replaces two colors a and b with c = -(a + b) mod 3. But in terms of our parity (assigning red=0, green=1, blue=1), let&#39;s see:If we merge a and b (different colors), one of them is 0 and the other is 1. The result is 1 (blue or green). So merging 0 and 1 gives 1. The sum before was 0 + 1 + rest. After merging, it&#39;s 1 + rest. So the sum modulo 2 remains the same: (0 + 1) + rest → 1 + rest. So the total sum changes by -0 -1 +1 = 0 mod 2. Therefore, the sum modulo 2 is preserved.Therefore, if we start with an even number of 1s (green or blue), we can only end with an even number of 1s. If the final state is one point, it must be 0 (red) if the initial sum was even, or 1 (green/blue) if the initial sum was odd. If the final state is two points, they must both be 1s (sum 0 mod 2) if initial sum was even, or both be 0s (sum 0 mod 2) if initial sum was odd? Wait, no. If the final state is two points, both must be the same color. If they are both 0 (red), sum is 0. If they are both 1 (green/blue), sum is 0 mod 2. So regardless of initial sum parity, the final sum is 0 mod 2. Wait, but this contradicts earlier. Let me clarify:The sum modulo 2 is preserved throughout operations. So if we start with sum S mod 2, then at every step, the sum remains S mod 2. If we end with one point, its color is S mod 2 (0 or 1). If we end with two points, both same color, so their sum is 0 mod 2 (either two 0s or two 1s). Therefore, if S is even (0 mod 2), then the final state must be two 0s or two 1s (sum 0). If S is odd (1 mod 2), the final state must be one 1.But the problem requires that from the initial state (missing one color), we can reach any final color. For example, starting with red and green (missing blue), which are 0 and 1. The sum S is the number of greens. If S is even, final state must be two 0s (red) or two 1s (green/blue). If S is odd, final state is one 1 (green/blue). However, blue is considered as 1 here. So if we start with an even number of greens (S even), we can end up with two reds (0s) or two blues/greens (1s). But blue is not present initially, but we can create it through operations. However, the final two 1s would both be green or blue? Wait, but green and blue are both considered as 1 in this parity model. So we can&#39;t distinguish them. Therefore, if we end with two 1s, they can be green or blue. Wait, no. The colors are distinct, but in our parity assignment, we grouped green and blue together. That might be a problem.Actually, perhaps this invariant is not sufficient to track the exact color, only the parity class. Therefore, if we want to reach a specific color, we need a different approach. Let&#39;s consider another invariant. Suppose we assign red=1, green=ω, blue=ω², where ω is a primitive third root of unity (ω³=1). Then, merging two colors a and b gives the third color c such that a + b + c = 0. So c = -(a + b). Then, the product of all colors (considering the multiplicative property) might be preserved. Let&#39;s see.Let’s define the product P = product of all colors (each color is 1, ω, or ω²). When we merge two colors a and b, replacing them with c = -(a + b). Then the new product P’ = (P / (a * b)) * c. But c = -(a + b). So P’ = P * (-(a + b)) / (a * b). If a and b are different, say a=1 and b=ω, then c=ω². Then -(a + b) = -(1 + ω) = ω² (since 1 + ω + ω² = 0). So P’ = P * ω² / (1 * ω) = P * ω² / ω = P * ω. Similarly, if a=ω and b=ω², c=1. Then -(a + b) = -(-1) = 1. So P’ = P * 1 / (ω * ω²) = P * 1 / 1 = P. Wait, this is inconsistent. Let me check:If a=ω and b=ω²:c = -(ω + ω²) = -(-1) = 1 (since 1 + ω + ω² = 0).So P’ = (P / (ω * ω²)) * 1 = (P / 1) * 1 = P.If a=1 and b=ω:c=ω².P’ = (P / (1 * ω)) * ω² = P * (ω² / ω) = P * ω.Similarly, a=1 and b=ω²:c=ω.P’ = (P / (1 * ω²)) * ω = P * (ω / ω²) = P * ω².Therefore, the product P is multiplied by ω or ω² when merging 1 with ω or 1 with ω², respectively. If we merge ω and ω², the product remains the same.Therefore, the product modulo multiplication by ω and ω² is an invariant. Depending on the merges, the product can change by factors of ω or ω². Therefore, the possible final colors depend on the initial product and the number of times we multiply by ω or ω².However, since we can choose the order of merges, perhaps we can adjust the product to be any of 1, ω, or ω². If the initial product is something, and we can perform merges in such a way to multiply by ω or ω² appropriately to reach any desired product.But how does this help? Suppose we start with an initial configuration missing one color. Let&#39;s say we start with red (1) and green (ω), missing blue (ω²). The initial product is 1^k * ω^(n - k). Depending on k and n, this product could be 1, ω, or ω². For example, if n=4 and k=2 (two reds and two greens), the product is 1² * ω² = ω². If we can multiply by ω or ω² through merges, we can reach any product. For n=4, starting with product ω², merging two different colors (1 and ω) would multiply by ω, resulting in ω³ = 1. Merging another pair could multiply by ω again, resulting in ω, etc. But this might allow reaching any product.However, I need to reconcile this with the earlier example where n=4, starting with R, G, R, G (product 1 * ω * 1 * ω = ω²). To reach final color blue (ω²), we need the final product to be ω². To reach red (1), the final product should be 1. To reach green (ω), the final product should be ω.Let’s see:Starting with product ω²:1. Merge R and G (1 and ω) to get B (ω²). The new product is (ω² * ω * 1 * 1) = ω² * ω = ω³ = 1. Wait, no. Wait, the initial product is 1 * ω * 1 * ω = ω². After merging two adjacent R and G (positions 1 and 2), replace them with B. So new configuration is B, R, G. The product is ω² * 1 * ω = ω³ = 1. Then merging R and G (positions 2 and 3): replace with B. New product is ω² * ω² = ω⁴ = ω. So final color is ω (green). Alternatively, merging B and R (positions 1 and 2): replace with G. New product is ω * G = ω * ω = ω². Then merging G and B: replace with R. New product is 1. So depending on merges, we can reach products 1, ω, or ω². Therefore, the final color can be any of the three.This aligns with our earlier example where n=4 allowed reaching any color. Therefore, the product invariant suggests that if the initial product can be adjusted through merges to reach any of the three roots of unity, then any final color is possible. For that, the number of merges that multiply by ω or ω² must be sufficient to cycle through the products.However, this requires that the number of merges affecting the product is such that we can reach any residue. In the n=4 case, starting with product ω², we can perform merges that multiply by ω or keep the product the same. By appropriately choosing merges, we can cycle through the products.Therefore, the key is whether the initial product can be transformed into any of 1, ω, ω² through merges. For that, the number of merges that can affect the product (i.e., merges between 1 and ω or 1 and ω²) must be sufficient. If the initial configuration allows enough such merges to adjust the product, then any final color is possible.But how does this depend on n? For even n, starting with two colors, say red and green, arranged alternately, we can perform merges in a way that cycles the product through 1, ω, ω². For odd n, starting with two colors, the number of merges would be limited, and the product might not cycle through all possibilities.For example, n=4 allows two merges that affect the product (each multiplying by ω or ω²). Starting from ω², two merges can lead to ω² * ω * ω = ω⁴ = ω, or ω² * ω² * ω² = ω^6 = 1, etc. Wait, but each merge either multiplies by ω or ω², depending on which pair you merge. Therefore, by choosing the order of merges, you can control the multiplication factor.In contrast, for odd n, say n=5, starting with two colors, the number of merges needed to reduce to 1 is four merges, each potentially multiplying the product by ω or ω². However, since 4 is even, multiplying by ω four times would result in ω^4 = ω, and multiplying by ω² four times would result in ω^8 = ω². So even with four merges, you can&#39;t reach all three products. Therefore, for odd n, the number of merges is even, so you can&#39;t reach all three colors. Whereas for even n, the number of merges is odd, allowing you to reach any product.Wait, let&#39;s clarify:For n=4 (even), to get from 4 points to 1, you need 3 merges. Each merge can multiply the product by ω or ω². Therefore, the total product is initial_product * (ω or ω²)^3. Since ω^3 = 1 and ω²^3 = ω^6 = 1. So the final product would be initial_product * 1 = initial_product. But that contradicts our earlier example. Wait, no. Wait, when merging two colors a and b, the product is multiplied by ω or ω² depending on which pair is merged. However, for a circle, the merges can be done in any order, and the multiplication factors can be controlled.Wait, maybe the key is that for even n, the initial product can be any of 1, ω, or ω², and through an odd number of merges (which multiply by ω or ω²), you can adjust the product to any value. For example, if initial product is ω², and you perform one merge multiplying by ω, you get ω³ = 1. Another merge multiplying by ω gives ω. Another merge multiplying by ω gives ω². So with three merges (odd), you can cycle through all three products.For odd n, the number of merges needed to get to 1 point is even (since n is odd, n-1 is even). Each merge multiplies by ω or ω², so the total product is initial_product * (ω or ω²)^{even}. Since ω^even is either 1 or ω²^{even} is 1. Therefore, the final product is initial_product. Therefore, for odd n, the final product is the same as the initial product. Hence, you cannot change the initial product through merges. Therefore, if the initial product is not 1, ω, or ω², you can&#39;t reach the others.But wait, the initial product is determined by the initial configuration. If you start with two colors, say red and green (1 and ω), and n is odd, then the initial product is 1^k * ω^{n - k}. The sum k + (n - k) = n. Since n is odd, either k is odd and n - k is even, or vice versa. Therefore, the initial product is ω^{n - k} = ω^{even} or ω^{odd}. Since n is odd, if k is even, n - k is odd, so product is ω^{odd} = ω. If k is odd, product is ω^{even} = 1. Therefore, for odd n, the initial product is either 1 or ω, depending on the number of greens. Therefore, the final product must be the same as the initial product, so you cannot reach all three colors. Only the initial product&#39;s color and possibly another if merging pairs that don&#39;t affect the product.Wait, but if n is odd and the initial product is 1 (if k is odd), then final product must be 1. If the initial product is ω (k even), then final product must be ω. Therefore, you can only reach the color corresponding to the initial product. Therefore, for odd n, it&#39;s impossible to reach all three colors. Only even n allow changing the product through an odd number of merges, thereby reaching any color.Therefore, the answer is all even integers n ≥ 4. But wait, the problem says n ≥ 3. So n=4, 6, 8, etc. But wait, let&#39;s check n=4 again. If n=4 is even, yes. For n=3 (odd), no. But wait, what about n=2? But the problem states n ≥ 3. So the answer is all even integers n ≥ 4? Wait, but the problem says &quot;Find all n for which there exists an initial state of n marked points with one missing colour, from which one can reach a final state of any of the three colours by applying a suitable sequence of steps.&quot;Therefore, based on the invariant analysis:- For even n ≥ 4, it&#39;s possible to have an initial configuration missing one color such that the product can be adjusted through merges to reach any final color.- For odd n, the product is fixed, so you can only reach one color (or two if considering the same parity).Therefore, the answer should be all even integers n ≥ 4. However, the problem might include n=2, but n ≥ 3. So the answer is all even n ≥ 4. But wait, let&#39;s verify with n=4.Yes, as we saw earlier, n=4 allows reaching any color. For n=6, even if my earlier attempts were confusing, according to the invariant, it should be possible. Therefore, the conclusion is that all even n ≥ 4 satisfy the condition.But the problem says &quot;Find all n ≥ 3&quot;. So the answer is all even integers n ≥ 4. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{4}? No, the problem asks for all such n. So the answer is all even integers greater than or equal to 4. But how to write that.Wait, in the problem statement, it says &quot;Find all n for which there exists...&quot;. So we need to specify all even n ≥ 4. In boxed notation, usually, if it&#39;s all even integers ≥4, we write boxed{2k} where k ≥ 2, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s standard. Alternatively, since the answer is all even integers n ≥ 4, we can write boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}. But in math competitions, often they expect the answer in the form boxed{n} where n is specific, but here it&#39;s multiple n.But in the original problem statement, the answer should be given as boxed{n} where n is the answer. But since it&#39;s asking for all n ≥ 3, which are even, maybe the answer is all even integers greater than or equal to 4, which can be written as boxed{2k} for integers k ≥ 2. But I need to check the standard way.In Olympiad problems, when the answer is all even numbers starting from 4, they write boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4} or using modularity. But since we need to put the final answer within boxed{}, maybe using the format specified. The user instruction says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So likely the answer is all even n ≥4, written as boxed{2k} for k ≥ 2, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, if the answer is n ≡ 0 mod 2 and n ≥4, then boxed{n text{ even and } n geq 4}.But in Chinese or other competitions, sometimes they just write the set {4,6,8,…} but in boxed. However, in the absence of specific instructions, the most standard way is to write &quot;All even integers n ≥ 4&quot; inside a box.But maybe the answer is n even, i.e., n ≡ 0 mod 2. But the problem states n ≥3. So combining both, the answer is all even integers n ≥4. Therefore, in the required format:boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}But I need to check if the initial example with n=4 works and whether higher even n also work.Yes, for n=4, it works. For n=6, similar logic applies. The key is that for even n, the number of merges is odd, allowing the product to cycle through all three possibilities. For odd n, the number of merges is even, keeping the product the same. Therefore, the answer is all even integers n ≥4.Final Answerboxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine for which values of ( n geq 3 ) there exists an initial state of ( n ) points missing one color, such that we can reach a final state of any of the three colors through a sequence of operations.  Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Understanding the Operation:   - Each operation replaces two neighboring points of different colors with a point of the third color.   - This reduces the number of points by one each time.2. Final State:   - The process stops when all remaining points have the same color.   - For odd ( n ), the process can reduce to 1 point.   - For even ( n ), the process can reduce to 2 points of the same color or 1 point if the last two are merged.3. Invariants and Modulo Analysis:   - Assigning values to colors (red=0, green=1, blue=2 modulo 3) and considering the sum modulo 3.   - Merging two colors ( a ) and ( b ) results in ( -(a + b) mod 3 ).   - The sum modulo 3 is not preserved, but parity (mod 2) considerations show that the sum modulo 2 is preserved.4. Product Invariant:   - Using primitive roots of unity, the product of colors modulo 3 can cycle through values depending on merges.   - For even ( n ), an odd number of merges allows cycling through all three colors.   - For odd ( n ), the number of merges is even, preserving the initial product modulo 3.5. Conclusion:   - For even ( n geq 4 ), the product invariant allows reaching any final color by appropriately choosing merges.   - For odd ( n ), the product invariant is fixed, restricting the final color to the initial parity. Final Answer:[boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have a circle with n ≥ 3 points, each colored red, green, or blue. The operation allowed is to erase two neighboring points of different colors and replace them with a new point of the third color. The goal is to find all n for which there exists an initial state missing one color (so only two colors are present initially) such that by applying these operations, we can end up with all points being the same color, and importantly, we can achieve a final state of any of the three colors. First, let me try to understand the problem step by step. We start with n points arranged in a circle. Each point is colored either red (R), green (G), or blue (B). However, the initial state is missing one color. So, the initial configuration uses only two of the three colors. For example, maybe it&#39;s only red and green, with no blue. Then, by performing these operations (erasing two neighboring points of different colors and replacing them with the third color), we want to be able to reach a monochromatic circle (all red, all green, or all blue). Moreover, we need the initial configuration to be such that depending on the sequence of operations we choose, we can end up with any of the three colors as the final state. So the question is asking for which values of n such an initial configuration exists. First, let me think about the operation itself. When we replace two neighboring points of different colors with the third color, we&#39;re effectively reducing the number of points by 1 each time. Wait, hold on: if we erase two neighboring points and replace them with one new point, then each operation reduces the number of points by 1. Therefore, starting from n points, after one operation, we have n-1 points. To reach a final state where all points are the same color, we need to perform operations until we have one point left. Wait, no: the problem says &quot;in a final state, all marked points have the same colour&quot;. So maybe we don&#39;t have to reduce to one point? Wait, the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour&quot;. So if we have multiple points left, they all need to be the same color. But each operation replaces two points with one. So starting from n points, each operation reduces the count by 1. Therefore, the final state would be when we have 1 point left. Wait, but 1 point is trivially all the same color. But maybe there&#39;s a different way the operations can be applied? Wait, maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting. Let me check the problem statement again.&quot;In one step, one can erase two neighboring marked points of different colours and mark a new point between the locations of the erased points with the third colour. In a final state, all marked points have the same colour which is called the colour of the final state.&quot;So, each operation replaces two points with one. Therefore, starting with n points, each step reduces the number by 1, so after k steps, we have n - k points. The process continues until we can&#39;t perform any more operations. However, the final state is when all points have the same color. So, if all points are the same color, you can&#39;t perform any operations, because you need two neighboring points of different colors to perform an operation. Therefore, the process stops when all points are the same color. So, starting from n points, you need to perform n - 1 operations to get down to 1 point, which is the only possible monochromatic state. Wait, but if n is even, you could have two points left, both the same color. Wait, no: each operation reduces the count by 1. So starting from n, after one operation: n-1. Then n-2, etc., until 1. Wait, but n can be even or odd. Let&#39;s see. Suppose n = 4. Then after 3 operations, you get to 1 point. But wait, if you have four points, each operation reduces by one. So after first operation, 3 points. Then second operation, 2 points. Then third operation, 1 point. But 2 points can only be operated on if they are different colors. If they are the same color, you can&#39;t perform the operation, so the process stops. Therefore, the final state can be either 1 point (if you can perform all operations until the end) or 2 points if you get stuck with two same-colored points. Wait, but the problem states that the final state is when all marked points have the same color. So, in the case where you have two points left of the same color, that&#39;s a valid final state. But if you have two points of different colors, you can perform another operation to get down to one point.Wait, maybe the process must continue until no more operations can be performed. So, if you have two points of different colors, you have to perform the operation again. So actually, the final state is when you have one point (if n was odd) or when you have two points of the same color (if n was even). Wait, but if you start with even n, you can only end with an even number of points if you get stuck. Wait, no: starting with n, each operation reduces by 1, so parity changes each time. If n is even, after even number of operations, you get to 2 points. If those two are different colors, you can perform another operation, reducing to 1 point, which is odd. But then, if n is even, you can end up with 1 point. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the key is that the process must continue until you cannot perform any more operations, so if you have two points left of different colors, you must perform another operation to get to one point. Therefore, regardless of n&#39;s parity, the final state is one point. Wait, that can&#39;t be. If you start with n=2, then you have two points. If they are different colors, you can perform an operation, replace them with one point. If they are the same color, you can&#39;t perform any operations. So depending on starting with n=2, you can end up with one point or stay at two points. But in our problem, n is at least 3. So starting with n ≥ 3. Therefore, the process would go until you can&#39;t perform any more operations, which would be when all points are the same color, but how many points are left depends on the operations. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.Wait, let&#39;s take an example. Suppose n=3, all three colors. Then, depending on the sequence, you can perform operations. But if all three are the same color, you can&#39;t perform any operations. Wait, but if you start with three points of different colors, say R, G, B arranged in a circle. Then, you can perform operations. For example, replace R and G with B. Then you have B and B left? Wait, no. Wait, if you have three points arranged in a circle: R, G, B. Let&#39;s say you replace R and G (neighbors) with B. Then the circle becomes B and B, but wait, how? Wait, replacing two neighboring points with one. So if you have three points in a circle, and you replace two neighbors with one, the circle would then have two points. Wait, but three points in a circle, each adjacent to two others. So if you replace two neighboring points, say R and G, with a B, then the circle would now have two points: B and B? Wait, no. Let me visualize:Original circle: R - G - B - R (since it&#39;s a circle). If we erase R and G (two neighbors), replace them with B. Then the circle would be B - B? But how? The original circle had three points. After removing two adjacent points (R and G), we insert a B between their positions. But since it&#39;s a circle, removing two adjacent points and inserting one in their place would result in two points: B and B. Wait, that seems to collapse the circle. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of segments. Each operation replaces two adjacent points with one. So, starting with three points, after one operation, you have two points. Then, if those two points are different colors, you can perform another operation to get down to one point. If they are the same color, you stop.But in the case where you start with three points of different colors, replacing two gives you two of the same color? Wait, let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s take R, G, B. Replace R and G with B. Now, the circle is B and B. Wait, but there were three points, replacing two with one, so now two points. Wait, but two points: B and the original B? Wait, maybe not. Wait, in the original circle, R is adjacent to G and B. If we replace R and G with a new point B, then the new point is between the original positions of R and G. So the circle becomes B (new) and B (original), adjacent to each other. So two B&#39;s. Then those two B&#39;s are the same color, so you can&#39;t perform any operations. Therefore, the final state is two B&#39;s. But the problem says &quot;all marked points have the same colour&quot;, which is the case here. So for n=3, starting with R, G, B, you can end up with two B&#39;s. But in the problem statement, we need to start with an initial state missing one color. So, for example, starting with two colors. Wait, the problem says &quot;initial state of n marked points with one missing colour&quot;. So if n=3, the initial state is missing one color, so only two colors. So, for example, two red and one green. Then, through operations, can we reach a final state of any color?Wait, but the problem states: &quot;Find all n for which there exists an initial state of n marked points with one missing colour, from which one can reach a final state of any of the three colours by applying a suitable sequence of steps.&quot;So, the initial state has n points, missing one color (so two colors present). From this, by applying steps, we can reach a final state (all points same color) of any of the three colors. So, even though the initial state is missing one color, through operations, which introduce the third color, we can end up with the third color. So, for example, if we start with only red and green, but through operations, we can create blue, and eventually end up with all blue.Therefore, the question is, for which n does such an initial configuration exist (with one color missing) such that by applying operations, we can reach a monochromatic state of any color (including the one that was missing initially).So, the answer will be certain n where this is possible. The problem is to find all such n.First, perhaps it&#39;s useful to think about invariants. In problems like these, often some invariant (a property that doesn&#39;t change under the allowed operations) can determine possible final states. So, if we can find an invariant that is preserved by each operation, then the initial configuration must have this invariant, and the final state must also have it. Therefore, if the final states of different colors have different invariants, then we cannot reach all colors from an initial state.So, let&#39;s try to find such an invariant.Suppose we assign a value to each color and look at some function (like the sum modulo something) that remains invariant under the operation.Let me consider the colors as elements of the cyclic group of order 3: R=0, G=1, B=2 modulo 3.Then, when we replace two neighboring colors a and b (different), we replace them with c = (-a - b) mod 3. Because the third color is determined by the two being replaced. For example, if we have R and G (0 and 1), the third color is B = 2, which is (-0 -1) mod 3 = 2. Similarly, replacing G and B (1 and 2) gives (-1 -2) mod 3 = (-3) mod 3 = 0, which is R. Similarly, replacing B and R (2 and 0) gives (-2 -0) mod 3 = -2 mod 3 = 1, which is G.Therefore, each operation replaces two colors a and b with (-a - b) mod 3.Now, consider the sum of all colors around the circle. Let S be the sum modulo 3.When we replace a and b with c = (-a -b) mod 3, the new sum becomes S - a - b + c = S - a - b + (-a -b) = S - 2a - 2b. But modulo 3, this is S - 2(a + b). However, the original sum was S, and after the operation, it&#39;s S - 2(a + b). Hmm, so the sum modulo 3 isn&#39;t preserved unless 2(a + b) ≡ 0 mod 3. But since a and b are different, and in 0,1,2, their sum can be 0+1=1, 0+2=2, 1+2=3≡0. So, if a + b ≡ 0 mod 3 (i.e., when replacing 1 and 2), then 2(a + b) ≡ 0, so the sum remains S. But if a + b ≡1 or 2 mod 3, then 2(a + b) ≡2 or 1 mod 3, so the sum would change. Therefore, the sum modulo 3 is not an invariant unless the two colors being replaced sum to 0 mod 3.Hmm, so maybe this approach doesn&#39;t directly give an invariant. Let me think again.Alternatively, maybe consider the number of each color modulo some number. For example, let’s think about the counts of each color modulo 2 or 3. Let me try modulo 2.Suppose we assign R=0, G=1, B=1 mod 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me see. The operation replaces two different colors with the third. If two colors are different, their sum mod 2 would be 1, and the third color is the remaining one. Let&#39;s see:If we replace R and G (0 and 1 mod 2) with B. If B is 1 mod 2, then replacing 0 and 1 with 1: the total count mod 2 would change. Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, maybe something else. Let&#39;s think of the parity of the number of color changes around the circle. But since the circle is dynamic (points are being removed and added), this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps consider the total number of points modulo 2. Each operation reduces the number of points by 1, so the parity changes each time. If we start with n points, after k operations, we have n - k points. The final state is when all points are the same color. If we end with 1 point, n - k =1, so k =n -1. If we end with 2 points, n -k =2, so k =n -2. But in any case, the parity of the number of operations is determined by n. However, I&#39;m not sure how this helps.Wait, maybe think in terms of possible final colors. Since the initial state is missing one color, say color C, then initially, the counts for C is zero. However, through operations, we can create color C. But to end up with all color C, we need some way to generate enough of them. Alternatively, perhaps use induction. Let&#39;s see for small n.Start with n=3. Suppose the initial state is missing one color, say blue. So we have two red and one green, or two green and one red. Let&#39;s see if we can reach all three colors as final states.Case 1: Initial state: R, R, G.Let&#39;s perform operations. The circle is R, R, G. The only possible operation is on the pair R and G (since they are different). So replace R and G with B. Now the circle becomes R, B. Now we have two points: R and B. Since they are different, replace them with G. Now we have one point: G. So the final color is G. Alternatively, if after replacing R and G with B, giving R and B, but in the circle, the order is R-B. If we instead first replace the other R and G? Wait, in a circle, R, R, G. The pairs are R-R, R-G, and G-R. The only pair with different colors is R-G. So only one possible operation. So replacing R and G with B gives R and B. Then replacing R and B with G. So final color G. So from R, R, G, we can only get to G. If we want to get to R or B, is that possible? Wait, seems not. Because once we perform the first operation, we can only get G. So starting from two R and one G, we can&#39;t reach all three colors. Maybe another initial configuration. Suppose starting with R, G, G. Then operations: replace R and G with B. Now have G, B. Then replace G and B with R. Final color R. Alternatively, after replacing R and G with B, we have G and B, leading to R. So starting from R, G, G, we can get R. But can we get B? If we have R, G, G. Let me see: the only possible first operation is R and G, replaced by B. Then G and B, replaced by R. So only R. Alternatively, is there another way? Wait, maybe not. So depending on the initial configuration, we might be able to reach only certain colors.Wait, but the problem states &quot;there exists an initial state of n marked points with one missing colour, from which one can reach a final state of any of the three colours&quot;. So for n=3, is there an initial state with two colors that allows reaching all three final colors?Wait, let&#39;s think: if we start with two colors arranged in a way that allows generating the third color, and then through different sequences, reach different final colors.Wait, but in the n=3 case, once you perform the first operation, you have two points. Then, depending on the first operation, you might be forced into a certain color. Maybe not. Wait, let&#39;s try an example.Suppose n=3, initial state: R, G, G. As above, we can only reach R. If we start with R, R, G, we can only reach G. If we start with R, G, R (arranged in a circle), the pairs are R-G, G-R, R-R. So again, only the R-G pairs can be operated on. Replace R and G with B, resulting in B, R. Then replace B and R with G. So again, final color G.Wait, but how do we get B as the final color? Maybe it&#39;s impossible. Then for n=3, starting with two colors, you can&#39;t reach all three final colors. Therefore, n=3 is not in the answer set.Similarly, check n=4. Suppose we have four points, missing one color, say blue. So initial state: R, G, R, G arranged alternately. Let&#39;s see.First operation: replace R and G with B. Let&#39;s choose which pair. If we replace the first R and G, we get B, R, G. Then the circle is B, R, G. Then replace R and G with B: B, B. Then we have two B&#39;s. Final color is B. Alternatively, in the initial R, G, R, G: replace the first R and G to get B, R, G. Then replace B and R with G: G, G. Final color G. Alternatively, in the initial state, replace the second R and G: same result. Alternatively, in the initial R, G, R, G: replace two R&#39;s? No, they are same color. So only operations on R and G pairs. Wait, perhaps a different initial configuration. Let&#39;s try two R&#39;s and two G&#39;s arranged as R, R, G, G. Then possible operations: R and G at the boundary between the two R&#39;s and two G&#39;s. Replace R and G with B. Now we have R, B, G. Then, in this new circle of R, B, G: possible operations. Replace R and B with G, resulting in G and G. Final color G. Or replace B and G with R, resulting in R and R. Final color R. Alternatively, replace R and G (the first and last elements?) Wait, in a circle of R, B, G, the neighbors are R-B, B-G, G-R. So operations can be on R and B (replace with G), B and G (replace with R), or G and R (replace with B). If we replace G and R (which are adjacent in the circle), we get B. Then the circle becomes B and B. So final color B.Wait, so starting with R, B, G (after first operation), we can choose to perform different operations leading to different final colors. So let&#39;s retrace:Original: R, R, G, G.First operation: replace the middle R and G (positions 2 and 3?) Wait, original arrangement is R, R, G, G. The neighbors are R-R, R-G, G-G, G-R. So only the R-G pair can be replaced. Replace R and G with B. Now the circle becomes R, B, G. Wait, how? If we remove the second R and third G, replace them with B, then the circle is R, B, G. Then, as before, in R, B, G, we can perform operations to reach G, R, or B. Therefore, from the initial R, R, G, G, by first replacing R and G to get R, B, G, then choosing which pair to replace next, we can get to any final color. Wait, let&#39;s verify:Starting with R, R, G, G.1. Replace the second R and third G (neighbors) with B. Now the circle is R, B, G (positions 1, new B, position 4 G?). Wait, maybe the arrangement is R, B, G arranged in a circle. So neighbors are R-B, B-G, G-R.2. Now, to reach final color R: replace B and G with R. Now circle is R and R. Final color R.3. To reach final color G: replace R and B with G. Now circle is G and G. Final color G.4. To reach final color B: replace G and R with B. Now circle is B and B. Final color B.Therefore, starting from R, R, G, G (n=4), we can reach any final color by choosing appropriate operations. Therefore, n=4 is possible.Similarly, check n=5. Let&#39;s see if there exists an initial configuration with two colors that can reach all three final colors. Let&#39;s try to create such a configuration.Alternatively, perhaps there&#39;s a pattern here. For even n, it&#39;s possible, for odd n, not. But n=3 is odd and not possible, n=4 is even and possible. Let&#39;s test n=5.Suppose we have n=5, with two colors, say R and G. Let&#39;s try to arrange them such that through operations, we can reach all three colors. Let&#39;s consider alternating R and G, but since 5 is odd, we can&#39;t have perfect alternation. So maybe two R&#39;s and three G&#39;s arranged in some way. For example: R, G, R, G, G. Let&#39;s see.First, possible operations: replace R and G neighbors. There are two R&#39;s, each adjacent to G&#39;s. Let&#39;s replace the first R and G (positions 1 and 2) with B. Now the circle becomes B, R, G, G. Now, we have four points: B, R, G, G. Then, replace R and G (positions 2 and 3) with B. Now we have B, B, G. Then, replace B and G (positions 3 and 1) with R. Now we have R and B. Replace R and B with G. Final color G. Alternatively, different operations:Starting from B, R, G, G. Replace B and R (positions 1 and 2) with G. Now we have G, G, G. All G&#39;s. So final color G. Alternatively, starting from B, R, G, G, replace G and G? Can&#39;t, same color. Replace B and R with G, as above. Alternatively, starting from B, R, G, G, replace R and G with B. So B, B, G. Then replace B and G with R, then R and B with G. So again, G.Alternatively, different initial steps. Let&#39;s try a different initial configuration for n=5. Maybe R, R, G, G, G. Let&#39;s see.Replace R and G (positions 2 and 3) with B. Now R, B, G, G. Then neighbors are R-B, B-G, G-G, G-R. Replace R and B (positions 1 and 2) with G. Now G, G, G. Final color G.Alternatively, from R, R, G, G, G. Replace R and G (positions 1 and 5) with B. Now B, R, G, G. Then replace B and R with G. Now G, G, G. Again, G.Alternatively, another approach. Maybe if we can find an invariant that depends on n modulo something. For example, considering the parity of n. For n even, possible; for n odd, not. Since in the n=3 (odd) case, we couldn&#39;t reach all colors, but in n=4 (even), we could. Let&#39;s test n=5 with another configuration.Suppose n=5, starting with R, G, R, G, R. That&#39;s alternating R and G, but with an extra R at the end. So neighbors are R-G, G-R, R-G, G-R, R-R. So possible operations on the R-G pairs. Replace first R and G with B: B, R, G, R. Now, neighbors are B-R, R-G, G-R, R-B. Replace R and G (positions 2 and 3) with B: B, B, R. Then replace B and R with G: G, B. Then replace G and B with R: R. Final color R. Alternatively, different operations. Starting from B, R, G, R. Replace B and R with G: G, G, R. Then replace G and R with B: B, G. Then replace B and G with R: R. Final color R. Alternatively, starting from B, R, G, R. Replace R and G with B: B, B, B. Final color B. Wait, so here we can reach both R and B. Hmm.Wait, let&#39;s try:Start: R, G, R, G, R (positions 1-5).First, replace positions 1 and 2 (R and G) with B: B, R, G, R.Now circle: B, R, G, R.Next, replace positions 3 and 4 (G and R) with B: B, R, B.Circle: B, R, B.Next, replace positions 1 and 2 (B and R) with G: G, B.Replace G and B with R: R.Final color R.Alternatively, starting from B, R, G, R:Replace positions 2 and 3 (R and G) with B: B, B, R.Replace positions 1 and 2 (B and B): cannot. Replace positions 2 and 3 (B and R) with G: B, G.Replace B and G with R: R.Alternatively, from B, R, G, R:Replace positions 4 and 1 (R and B) with G: G, R, G.Circle: G, R, G.Replace positions 2 and 3 (R and G) with B: G, B.Replace G and B with R: R.Alternatively, from B, R, G, R:Replace positions 1 and 4 (B and R) with G: G, R, G.Same as above.Alternatively, maybe a different path. Start from R, G, R, G, R.Replace positions 2 and 3 (G and R) with B: R, B, G, R.Circle: R, B, G, R.Replace positions 3 and 4 (G and R) with B: R, B, B.Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and B) with G: G, B.Replace G and B with R: R.Alternatively, starting from R, B, G, R:Replace positions 1 and 4 (R and R): same color, can&#39;t. Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and B) with G: G, G, R.Then replace positions 2 and 3 (G and R) with B: G, B.Replace G and B with R: R.Alternatively, replace positions 2 and 3 (B and G) with R: R, R, R.Then all R&#39;s. Wait, how?Wait, in the circle R, B, G, R:Neighbors are R-B, B-G, G-R, R-R.So possible operations on R-B, B-G, G-R.Replace B-G with R: R, R, R.Then we have three R&#39;s. But since they are all the same color, we can&#39;t perform operations. So final color R. So that&#39;s another path to R.Wait, but can we get to B or G?From R, B, G, R:Replace B-G with R: R, R, R. Final color R.Replace R-B with G: G, G, R. Then replace G-R with B: G, B. Then G-B with R: R.Replace G-R with B: R, B, B. Then R-B with G: G, B. Then G-B with R: R.No matter the path, seems like we can only get R. Therefore, starting from R, G, R, G, R, maybe we can only reach R. If we start with a different configuration, perhaps we can get different colors.Alternatively, start with three R&#39;s and two G&#39;s: R, R, R, G, G. Let&#39;s try.First, replace R and G (positions 3 and 4) with B: R, R, B, G.Now circle: R, R, B, G.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G, G.Replace R and G (positions 1 and 2) with B: B, G.Replace B and G with R: R.Final color R.Alternatively, from R, R, B, G:Replace B and G (positions 3 and 4) with R: R, R, R.Final color R.Alternatively, from R, R, B, G:Replace positions 4 and 1 (G and R) with B: B, R, B.Replace B and R with G: G, B.Replace G and B with R: R.So again, only R.Hmm, perhaps for n=5, regardless of the initial configuration with two colors, we can only reach one or two final colors, but not all three. Therefore, n=5 might not be possible. If so, then maybe only even n are possible. But let&#39;s test n=6.Take n=6, with an initial configuration missing one color. For example, R and G arranged alternately: R, G, R, G, R, G. Let&#39;s see.First operation: replace any R and G pair with B. Let&#39;s replace the first R and G with B: B, R, G, R, G. Now the circle has 5 points: B, R, G, R, G.Next, replace R and G (positions 2 and 3) with B: B, B, R, G. Now 4 points: B, B, R, G.Next, replace R and G (positions 3 and 4) with B: B, B, B. Final color B.Alternatively, different path. Starting from R, G, R, G, R, G.First, replace positions 1 and 2 (R-G) with B: B, R, G, R, G.Next, replace positions 5 and 6 (G-R) with B: B, R, G, B.Now, circle: B, R, G, B.Replace R and G (positions 2 and 3) with B: B, B, B. Final color B.Alternatively, from B, R, G, B:Replace B and R (positions 1 and 2) with G: G, G, B.Replace G and B (positions 3 and 1) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B. Final color B.Hmm, but is there a way to get a different final color?Starting from R, G, R, G, R, G.Replace positions 1 and 2 (R-G) with B: B, R, G, R, G.Then replace positions 3 and 4 (G-R) with B: B, R, B, G.Now, circle: B, R, B, G.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: B, G, G.Replace B and G (positions 1 and 2) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B. Final color B.Alternatively, from B, R, B, G:Replace B and G (positions 4 and 1) with R: R, R, B.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Hmm, still B. Let me try another approach.Starting from R, G, R, G, R, G.Replace positions 2 and 3 (G-R) with B: R, B, G, R, G.Circle: R, B, G, R, G.Replace positions 4 and 5 (R-G) with B: R, B, G, B.Replace positions 1 and 2 (R-B) with G: G, G, B.Replace positions 3 and 1 (B-G) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Still ending at B. Maybe there&#39;s a different sequence.Alternatively, from R, B, G, B:Replace B and G (positions 2 and 3) with R: R, R, B.Replace R and B (positions 3 and 1) with G: G, R.Replace G and R with B: B.Alternatively, starting from R, G, R, G, R, G:Replace positions 1 and 6 (R-G) with B: B, G, R, G, R.Now circle: B, G, R, G, R.Replace positions 2 and 3 (G-R) with B: B, B, G, R.Replace positions 4 and 5 (R-B) with G: B, B, G.Replace B and G (positions 3 and 1) with R: R, B.Replace R and B with G: G.So final color G. Ah! Here, by choosing a different initial operation, we ended up with G. Let&#39;s trace this:1. Start: R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace positions 1 and 6 (R and G) with B: circle becomes B, G, R, G, R.3. Replace positions 2 and 3 (G and R) with B: B, B, G, R.4. Replace positions 4 and 5 (R and B) with G: B, B, G.5. Replace positions 3 and 1 (G and B) with R: R, B.6. Replace R and B with G: G.Final color G. So that&#39;s one way. Now, can we get R?Let&#39;s try:Starting from R, G, R, G, R, G.1. Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and G) with B: B, R, G, R, G.2. Replace positions 5 and 6 (G and R) with B: B, R, G, B.3. Replace positions 3 and 4 (G and B) with R: B, R, R.4. Replace positions 1 and 2 (B and R) with G: G, R.5. Replace G and R with B: B. No, ends at B.Alternatively, different steps:1. Start: R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace positions 3 and 4 (R and G) with B: R, G, B, R, G.3. Replace positions 5 and 6 (G and R) with B: R, G, B, B.4. Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and G) with B: B, B, B.Final color B.Alternatively, another path:1. Start: R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace positions 2 and 3 (G and R) with B: R, B, G, R, G.3. Replace positions 4 and 5 (R and G) with B: R, B, G, B.4. Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and B) with G: G, G, B.5. Replace positions 3 and 1 (B and G) with R: R, G.6. Replace R and G with B: B.Still B. Hmm.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to reach R.Starting from R, G, R, G, R, G.1. Replace positions 1 and 6 (R and G) with B: B, G, R, G, R.2. Replace positions 2 and 3 (G and R) with B: B, B, G, R.3. Replace positions 3 and 4 (G and R) with B: B, B, B.Final color B.Not helpful. Another try:1. Start: R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace positions 4 and 5 (G and R) with B: R, G, R, B, G.3. Replace positions 5 and 6 (G and R) with B: R, G, R, B.4. Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and G) with B: B, R, B.5. Replace positions 2 and 3 (R and B) with G: B, G.6. Replace B and G with R: R.So here&#39;s a path to R:Steps:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace G (pos4) and R (pos5) with B: R, G, R, B, G.Wait, but pos5 is R, pos6 is G. So replacing pos5 and pos6: R and G with B. Then circle becomes R, G, R, B, B. Then steps continue:3. Replace R and G (pos1 and pos2) with B: B, R, B, B.4. Replace B and R (pos2 and pos3) with G: B, G, B.5. Replace G and B (pos2 and pos3) with R: B, R.6. Replace B and R with G: G.Wait, ended at G again. Hmm.Alternatively, another path:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace pos3 and pos4 (R and G) with B: R, G, B, R, G.3. Replace pos5 and pos6 (G and R) with B: R, G, B, B.4. Replace pos1 and pos2 (R and G) with B: B, B, B.Final color B.Alternatively:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace pos2 and pos3 (G and R) with B: R, B, G, R, G.3. Replace pos4 and pos5 (R and G) with B: R, B, G, B.4. Replace pos1 and pos2 (R and B) with G: G, G, B.5. Replace pos3 and pos1 (B and G) with R: R, G.6. Replace R and G with B: B.Still B. Hmm.Is there a way to reach R?Wait, earlier when we did the alternate starting step:1. Replace pos1 and pos6 (R and G) with B: B, G, R, G, R.2. Replace pos2 and pos3 (G and R) with B: B, B, G, R.3. Replace pos4 and pos5 (R and B) with G: B, B, G.4. Replace pos3 and pos1 (G and B) with R: R, B.5. Replace R and B with G: G.Wait, but if instead of step 4, after B, B, G:Replace pos1 and pos2 (B and B) can&#39;t. Replace pos2 and pos3 (B and G) with R: B, R.Replace pos1 and pos2 (B and R) with G: G.Replace pos1 and pos2 (G and nothing?) Wait, after B, R, we have two points. Replace B and R with G: G.Hmm. Not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps starting with a different initial configuration for n=6. Instead of alternating R and G, maybe three R&#39;s and three G&#39;s arranged differently.For example: R, R, R, G, G, G.First operation: replace an R and G. Let&#39;s replace the fourth G and first R? Wait, neighbors are R-R, R-R, R-G, G-G, G-G, G-R. So only the R-G pairs can be replaced. Let&#39;s replace the third R and fourth G with B. Now circle is R, R, B, G, G. Now, five points.Replace R and B (positions 1 and 3) with G: G, R, G, G.Replace G and R (positions 2 and 3) with B: G, B, G.Replace B and G (positions 2 and 3) with R: G, R.Replace G and R with B: B.Final color B.Alternatively, different path from R, R, B, G, G:Replace B and G (positions 3 and 4) with R: R, R, R, G.Replace R and G (positions 4 and 1) with B: R, R, B.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Still B.Alternatively, another initial configuration for n=6: R, R, G, G, R, G.Let&#39;s try operations:Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and R): can&#39;t. Replace positions 2 and 3 (R and G) with B: R, B, G, R, G.Now circle: R, B, G, R, G.Replace positions 4 and 5 (R and G) with B: R, B, G, B.Replace positions 1 and 2 (R and B) with G: G, G, B.Replace positions 3 and 1 (B and G) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Still ending at B. Hmm.Alternatively, perhaps n=6 is not possible to reach all three colors. But earlier, we saw that with n=4, we could. Maybe the parity isn&#39;t the key.Wait, let&#39;s think again. In the n=4 case, we could reach all three colors because after the first operation, we had three points (which allowed introducing the third color), and from there, through operations, we could choose different paths. For n=6, maybe a similar approach.Wait, let&#39;s try starting with n=6, missing one color, but arranged such that after a few operations, we can get to a state with multiple colors, allowing different paths.Suppose initial configuration: R, R, R, G, G, G.Replace R and G (positions 3 and 4) with B: R, R, B, G, G.Now, circle: R, R, B, G, G.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G, G, G.Replace R and G (positions 1 and 2) with B: B, G, G.Replace B and G (positions 1 and 2) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Final color B.Alternatively, from R, G, G, G:Replace R and G (positions 1 and 2) with B: B, G, G.Replace B and G (positions 1 and 2) with R: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.No luck. Alternatively, start from R, R, B, G, G:Replace B and G (positions 3 and 4) with R: R, R, R, G.Replace R and G (positions 4 and 1) with B: R, R, B.Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G.Replace R and G with B: B.Still B.Alternatively, from R, R, B, G, G:Replace R and R (positions 1 and 2): can&#39;t. Replace R and B (positions 2 and 3) with G: R, G, G, G.As before.Hmm. Maybe for n=6, even though it&#39;s even, it&#39;s not possible to reach all three colors. That contradicts my earlier thought that even n are possible. So maybe there&#39;s another factor.Wait, let&#39;s think back to the n=4 case. The key was that after the first operation, we had a three-color configuration (R, B, G), which allowed us to choose different operations to reach different colors. For n=6, maybe we need to create a three-color configuration at some point.But starting from two colors, can we introduce the third color and then have enough flexibility to reach all three?In the n=4 example, we did that. For n=6, maybe it&#39;s possible, but the path is more complicated. Let&#39;s try again.Start with n=6: R, G, R, G, R, G.First operation: Replace pos1 and pos2 (R and G) with B: B, R, G, R, G.Now, circle: B, R, G, R, G.Second operation: Replace pos3 and pos4 (G and R) with B: B, R, B, G.Third operation: Replace pos4 and pos5 (G and B) with R: B, R, R.Fourth operation: Replace pos2 and pos3 (R and R) – can&#39;t.Replace pos1 and pos2 (B and R) with G: G, R.Replace G and R with B: B.Still ends at B.Alternatively, different steps after third operation:After third operation: B, R, R.Replace pos1 and pos3 (B and R) with G: G, R.Replace G and R with B: B.Alternatively, from B, R, R:Replace pos1 and pos2 (B and R) with G: G, R.Replace G and R with B: B.No help.Alternatively, after first operation, B, R, G, R, G:Replace pos2 and pos3 (R and G) with B: B, B, R, G.Replace pos4 and pos5 (G and B) with R: B, B, R.Replace pos1 and pos2 (B and B) – can&#39;t.Replace pos2 and pos3 (B and R) with G: B, G.Replace B and G with R: R.Final color R.So here&#39;s a path to R:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace R and G (pos1-2) → B: B, R, G, R, G.3. Replace R and G (pos2-3) → B: B, B, R, G.4. Replace G and B (pos4-5) → R: B, B, R.5. Replace B and R (pos2-3) → G: B, G.6. Replace B and G → R: R.So final color R.Is there a way to reach G?Let&#39;s try:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace pos1-2 (R-G) → B: B, R, G, R, G.3. Replace pos3-4 (G-R) → B: B, R, B, G.4. Replace pos4-5 (G-B) → R: B, R, B.5. Replace pos1-2 (B-R) → G: G, B.6. Replace G-B → R: R.Still R.Alternatively:1. R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace pos2-3 (G-R) → B: R, B, R, G, G.3. Replace pos4-5 (G-G) → can&#39;t.4. Replace pos5-6 (G-R) → B: R, B, R, B.5. Replace pos1-2 (R-B) → G: G, R, B.6. Replace pos2-3 (R-B) → G: G, G.Final color G.Yes! Here&#39;s a path to G:Steps:1. Start: R, G, R, G, R, G.2. Replace pos2-3 (G-R) → B: R, B, R, G, G.3. Replace pos5-6 (G-R) → B: R, B, R, B.4. Replace pos1-2 (R-B) → G: G, R, B.5. Replace pos2-3 (R-B) → G: G, G.Final color G.Therefore, starting from R, G, R, G, R, G (n=6), we can reach B, R, and G by choosing different operation sequences. For B, as in the first example, for R as above, and for G as here. So n=6 is possible. Therefore, it seems that even n are possible, while odd n are not. Because for even n, you can pair up the colors and perform operations that eventually allow reaching any color, while for odd n, the parity or some invariant prevents it.But let&#39;s check n=5 again to see if there&#39;s any way.Suppose n=5, and we start with R, G, R, G, B. Wait, but initial state must be missing one color. So we can&#39;t have all three colors. So starting with two colors. Let me try again with n=5.Start with R, R, G, G, G.Replace pos2-3 (R-G) → B: R, B, G, G.Now, circle: R, B, G, G.Replace pos3-4 (G-G) → can&#39;t.Replace pos1-2 (R-B) → G: G, G, G.Final color G.Alternatively, from R, B, G, G:Replace pos2-3 (B-G) → R: R, R, G.Replace pos1-2 (R-R) → can&#39;t.Replace pos3-1 (G-R) → B: B, R.Replace B-R → G: G.Final color G.Alternatively, starting from R, B, G, G:Replace pos3-4 (G-G) → can&#39;t.Replace pos4-1 (G-R) → B: R, B, B.Replace pos1-2 (R-B) → G: G, B.Replace G-B → R: R.So here, starting from R, R, G, G, G (n=5), we can reach G or R, but not B.But can we reach B? Let&#39;s see.Start with R, R, G, G, G.Replace pos3-4 (G-G): can&#39;t.Replace pos4-5 (G-G): can&#39;t.Replace pos5-1 (G-R) → B: B, R, G, G.Now circle: B, R, G, G.Replace pos2-3 (R-G) → B: B, B, G.Replace pos3-1 (G-B) → R: R, B.Replace R-B → G: G.Final color G. No.Alternatively, from B, R, G, G:Replace pos1-2 (B-R) → G: G, G, G.Final color G.Alternatively, replace pos3-4 (G-G) → can&#39;t.Replace pos4-1 (G-B) → R: R, R, G.Replace pos3-1 (G-R) → B: B, R.Replace B-R → G: G.No.Therefore, for n=5, starting from two colors, we can only reach two final colors, not all three. Therefore, odd n are not possible, even n are possible.Thus, the answer is all even integers n ≥ 4. Wait, but n=4 is the minimal even number ≥3. The problem states n ≥3. So possible n are even numbers starting from 4? Wait, but n=2 is not considered since n ≥3. So the answer is all even integers n ≥4. But wait, in the n=4 case, we can achieve all three colors, and in n=6 as well. But what about n=2? But n starts at 3. So the answer is all even n ≥4.But wait, the problem says &quot;n ≥3&quot;. So maybe n even and ≥4. Therefore, the answer is all even integers n where n ≥4. Hence, n must be even and at least 4. So the final answer is all even integers n ≥4. But let me verify with n=6, which works. Therefore, the answer is all even integers n ≥4. So boxed{n text{ even}, n geq 4} in boxed notation. But how to represent that? The problem says &quot;Find all n for which there exists...&quot;, so we need to specify all even integers n where n ≥4. In the required format, using LaTeX.Typically, such answers are written as boxed{2k} where k ≥2, but since the problem says &quot;Find all n&quot;, probably as boxed{text{all even integers }n geq 4}. But in the context of Olympiad problems, sometimes they expect the answer in terms of modulo or parity. Since the possible n are even numbers starting at 4, the standard way to write this is: all even integers greater than or equal to 4. So in LaTeX, boxed{text{All even integers }n geq 4}. But maybe the answer expects n ≡0 mod 2 and n ≥4. Alternatively, in the problem statement, they might expect the answer as &quot;all even n ≥4&quot;, which in boxed form is written as boxed{2k} for integers k ≥2. But to match the problem&#39;s answer style, likely:Final Answerboxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}But I need to check the problem&#39;s instructions. The user says &quot;put your final answer within boxed{}&quot;. So likely, the answer is that all even n ≥4 work. In Olympiad problems, this is often expressed as &quot;all even integers n ≥4&quot;, which in boxed form can be written as boxed{2k} for k ≥2, but the problem might expect specifying n as even and ≥4. Since in Chinese and other Olympiads, sometimes they expect the answer phrased as &quot;all even integers greater than or equal to 4&quot;, but in a mathematical notation.Alternatively, if the answer is n is even and n ≥4, the standard way is to write n ≡0 mod 2 and n ≥4. However, the problem might accept the answer as boxed{2k} where k ≥2, but since n is specified as ≥3, maybe not. To be safe, I think the answer is all even integers n with n ≥4, so boxed as boxed{n text{ is even and } n geq 4}.But looking at previous problem solutions, sometimes they use the phrase inside the box. For example:boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}Yes, that seems acceptable.Final Answerboxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}&lt;/think&gt;To solve the problem, we need to determine for which values of ( n ) there exists an initial state of ( n ) points (missing one color) from which we can reach a final state of any of the three colors using the given operations. Key Steps and Reasoning:1. Understanding the Operation:   - Each operation replaces two neighboring points of different colors with a point of the third color, reducing the number of points by 1.   - The final state is a single color, which can be achieved by reducing the number of points to 1.2. Invariant Analysis:   - Consider the sum of colors modulo 3. However, this approach did not directly yield an invariant.   - Instead, we analyzed the parity of ( n ). For even ( n ), we can pair operations to introduce the third color and maneuver to any final color. For odd ( n ), the parity restricts flexibility.3. Testing Small Cases:   - ( n = 3 ): Starting with two colors, we found it impossible to reach all three final colors.   - ( n = 4 ): Starting with an alternating configuration (e.g., R, G, R, G), we can reach any final color by strategically introducing the third color and performing operations.   - ( n = 5 ): Similar testing showed it impossible to reach all three final colors.   - ( n = 6 ): By carefully choosing operations, we demonstrated it is possible to reach all three final colors.4. Generalizing the Pattern:   - For even ( n ), the flexibility in operations allows introducing the third color and strategically reducing the points to achieve any final color.   - For odd ( n ), the parity restricts this flexibility, making it impossible to achieve all three final colors. Conclusion:The solution involves recognizing that even ( n ) allows the necessary flexibility to introduce and propagate the third color through operations, while odd ( n ) does not. Therefore, the answer is:[boxed{text{All even integers } n geq 4}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🔑:</span>Answer: All even numbers n greater than 2.We show first that required initial states are impossible for odd n. Note that if one colour is missing then the numbers of marked points of the existing two colours have different parities, i.e., the difference of these numbers is odd. Each step keeps the parity of the difference of the numbers of marked points of these two colours unchanged. Hence in every intermediate state and also in the final state, one of these two colours is represented. Consequently, a final state of the third colour is impossible.For every even number n&gt;2, an initial state with 2 consecutive points marked with one colour and n-2 points marked with another colour satisfies the conditions of the problem. Indeed, if n&gt;4 then with two symmetric steps, one can reach a similar state where the number of points marked with the more popular colour is 2 less. Hence it suffices to solve the case n=4. In this case, making one step leads to a state with 3 marked points, all with different colours. In order to obtain a final state of any given colour, one can replace points of the other two colours with a new point of the given colour. This completes the solution.## 2nd Solution:Definition: Call a configuration colourful, if the final state may have any of the three colours.The case of n being odd is excluded as in the first solution, so let n&gt;2 be even. To construct colourful configurations, we consider linear configurations, i.e., one where the points are placed on a line instead of a circle. There is only one difference to the circular situation: We may not choose the two end points for the replacement step. So it suffices to construct linear colourful configurations.We start by providing explicit examples for n=4 and n=6 (with the bold letters being replaced):begin{aligned}&amp; mathbf{R G} R G rightarrow B mathbf{R G} rightarrow B B &amp; R mathbf{G R} G rightarrow R mathbf{B G} rightarrow R R &amp; R mathbf{G R} G rightarrow mathbf{R B} G rightarrow G G &amp; mathbf{R G} R R G R rightarrow B R R mathbf{G R} rightarrow B R mathbf{R B} rightarrow B mathbf{R G} rightarrow B B &amp; R mathbf{G R} R G R rightarrow R B mathbf{R G} R rightarrow mathbf{R B} B R rightarrow mathbf{G B} R rightarrow R R &amp; R mathbf{G R} R G R rightarrow R B mathbf{R G} R rightarrow mathbf{R B} B R rightarrow G mathbf{B R} rightarrow G G .end{aligned}Next observe that the concatenation of several linear colourful configurations is again colourful: Indeed, each part can be transformed into the desired colour independently. So the building blocks for n=4 and n=6 can produce colourful configurations of any even length.Actually, one can prove a lot more about colourful configurations:Proposition: Denote the number of red, green, and blue points in the initial state by R, G, and B respectively. A circular configuration is colourful if and only ifR equiv G equiv B quad(bmod 2)and it contains at least two colours.Proof. We have already seen in the solution above that R-G bmod 2, G-B bmod 2, and B-R bmod 2 are invariants. Moreover, it is obvious that we need at least two colours to be able to do anything. So the conditions are necessary.We prove that they are sufficient: For n=3 the conditions require R=G=B=1 and the configuration is indeed colourful. We continue by induction for n&gt;3: As n&gt;3, there is at least one colour with more than one point, so assume w.l.o.g. R&gt;1. Having at least two colours, we can find a pair of two different colours, one of which is red. Assume w.l.o.g. that the other is green. As a first step, replace these two points. The resulting configuration has R-1 red, G-1 green, and B+1 blue points, so it satisfies R-1 equiv G-1 equiv B+1 bmod 2. Moreover, due to R&gt;1, it has at least one red and one blue point. So by induction, the configuration is colourful, and hence so was our original state.This classification of colourful configurations has some nice consequences:Proposition: If a circular configuration is colourful, then so is any permutation of its points.Proof.

First, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what&#39;s being asked. We have an odd function f(x) defined on all real numbers. When x is greater than 0, the function is given as f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1). Then there are four conclusions, A to D, and we need to determine which are correct. Let&#39;s go through each option one by one, but first, let&#39;s recall what it means for a function to be odd.An odd function satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. Also, since it&#39;s defined on all real numbers, f(0) must be 0 because for an odd function, f(-0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = -f(0), which can only be true if f(0) = 0. That immediately tells me that option A, which claims f(0) = -6, is incorrect. So A is out. Let me note that.Now, moving on to option C: When x &lt; 0, f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). Since the function is odd, for x &lt; 0, we can express f(x) as -f(-x). Let&#39;s verify that. Let&#39;s take x &lt; 0, so -x &gt; 0, and f(-x) would be (-x) - 6/(-x + 1). Wait, hold on. The given function for x &gt; 0 is f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1). Therefore, substituting -x into that, we get f(-x) = (-x) - 6/(-x + 1). Then, since f(x) is odd, f(x) = -f(-x) = -[ -x - 6/(-x + 1) ] = x + 6/(-x + 1). Let&#39;s simplify the denominator: -x + 1 is the same as 1 - x. So f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). That matches option C exactly. So C is correct. So I can check off C as correct.Wait, let me double-check that. If x is negative, then f(x) = -f(-x). Since -x is positive, f(-x) = (-x) - 6/((-x) + 1) = -x -6/( -x +1 ). Then, f(x) = - [ -x -6/( -x +1 ) ] = x + 6/( -x +1 ). But -x +1 can be written as 1 - x. So yes, 6/(1 - x). So f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x) when x &lt; 0. Therefore, C is correct. So that&#39;s one correct answer.Now, moving to option B: |f(x)| is monotonically increasing on the intervals [-2, 0) and [2, +∞). Hmm. So we need to check the monotonicity of the absolute value of f(x) on those intervals. Since the function is odd, maybe we can check for x &gt; 0 first and then use symmetry for x &lt; 0.But let&#39;s first handle x &gt; 0. For x &gt; 0, f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1). Let&#39;s compute its derivative to see if it&#39;s increasing or decreasing. The derivative f’(x) would be 1 - 6 * (-1)/(x + 1)^2 = 1 + 6/(x + 1)^2. Since (x + 1)^2 is always positive, 6/(x + 1)^2 is positive, so f’(x) = 1 + positive term. Therefore, f’(x) is always greater than 1 for x &gt; 0. That means f(x) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞). Therefore, |f(x)| on [2, +∞) would just be f(x) because if f(x) is increasing and we need to check if it&#39;s positive there. Let&#39;s see the value at x = 2: f(2) = 2 - 6/(3) = 2 - 2 = 0. Wait, f(2) is 0? Then for x &gt; 2, f(x) would be increasing from 0 onwards, so positive. Hence, |f(x)| is equal to f(x) for x &gt;= 2. Since f(x) is increasing on [2, ∞), then |f(x)| is also increasing there. So for [2, ∞), B says |f(x)| is monotonically increasing, which is correct.Now, for the interval [-2, 0). Let&#39;s use the fact that f(x) is odd, so |f(x)| = | -f(-x) | = |f(-x)|. Therefore, the behavior of |f(x)| on [-2, 0) is the same as |f(-x)| on (0, 2]. Since -x is in (0,2], which is a subset of (0, ∞), and we already know that on (0, ∞), f(x) is increasing. However, f(x) at x =0 is 0, and at x approaching 0 from the right, f(x) approaches 0 - 6/(0 +1) = -6. Wait, hold on. Wait, f(0) is 0, but when x approaches 0 from the right, f(x) approaches 0 - 6/1 = -6. Wait, but since f is odd, f(0) must be 0, but the function approaches -6 from the right. So there&#39;s a jump or a discontinuity? Wait, but the function is defined on all real numbers. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a point of discontinuity at x = -1? Because when x approaches -1 from the right, x +1 approaches 0 from the positive side, but for x &lt;0, the expression is x +6/(1 -x). Wait, let&#39;s check if x = -1 is in the domain. The original function is defined on all real numbers, but when x &gt;0, f(x) = x -6/(x +1). For x approaching -1 from the left (since x &lt;0), x approaches -1, 1 - x approaches 2, so the denominator doesn&#39;t cause a problem. Wait, but if x approaches -1 from the right, but x &lt;0, so x approaches -1 from the left? Wait, no. For x &lt;0, x can approach -1 from the right (i.e., approaching -1 from higher values, since x &lt;0). Wait, maybe I need to check the expression for f(x) when x &lt;0.Wait, when x &lt;0, f(x) = x +6/(1 -x). Let&#39;s check x approaching -1 from above (i.e., x approaches -1 from the right). Then 1 - x approaches 1 - (-1) = 2, so f(x) approaches -1 +6/2 = -1 +3 =2. If x approaches -1 from the left (which would be x approaching -1 from below, but x is already less than 0. Hmm. Wait, x is approaching -1 from the left would mean x is going towards -1 from more negative values, but since the function is defined for all real numbers, x can approach -1 from both sides. Wait, but for x &lt;0, the expression is x +6/(1 -x). So as x approaches -1 from the left (x approaching -1 from the negative side), 1 -x becomes 1 - (-1) =2, so again, x approaches -1, f(x) approaches -1 +6/2=2. So actually, at x =-1, the function is continuous? Wait, but let&#39;s compute f(-1). Since f is odd, f(-1) = -f(1). Compute f(1) =1 -6/(1 +1)=1 -3= -2. Therefore, f(-1)=2. Which matches the limit as x approaches -1 from both sides. So f(x) is continuous at x=-1. So that&#39;s okay.But going back to option B: |f(x)| is monotonically increasing on [-2,0). Let&#39;s analyze the function on [-2,0). Since f(x) is odd, |f(x)| = | -f(-x) | = |f(-x)|. So the behavior on [-2,0) is mirrored from the behavior on (0,2]. So we need to check if |f(x)| is increasing on [-2,0) which is equivalent to |f(-x)| being increasing as x goes from -2 to 0, which is equivalent to |f(y)| being increasing as y goes from 0 to 2. Wait, but y = -x, so when x increases from -2 to 0, y decreases from 2 to 0. So the question is: as y decreases from 2 to 0, is |f(y)| increasing? Wait, but we need to see if |f(y)| is increasing as y decreases from 2 to 0, which is equivalent to |f(y)| increasing as y increases from 0 to 2 but in reverse. So if |f(y)| is decreasing as y increases from 0 to 2, then |f(-x)| would be increasing as x increases from -2 to 0. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute the derivative of |f(x)| on [-2,0). Since f(x) is odd, and x is in [-2,0), let&#39;s express f(x) as x +6/(1 -x). Then, to compute |f(x)|, we need to know where f(x) is positive or negative on [-2,0). Let&#39;s first find the sign of f(x) on [-2,0). Let&#39;s pick a test point in [-2,0), say x = -1. f(-1) = -1 +6/(1 - (-1))= -1 +6/2= -1 +3=2, which is positive. Another test point, x approaching 0 from the left: f(x) =x +6/(1 -x). As x approaches 0 from the left, x approaches 0, so f(x) approaches 0 +6/1=6, which is positive. So f(x) is positive on [-2,0). Therefore, |f(x)|=f(x) on [-2,0). So we can just check if f(x) is increasing on [-2,0). To check that, compute its derivative. f(x)=x +6/(1 -x). The derivative f’(x) is 1 +6/(1 -x)^2. Because derivative of 6/(1 -x) is 6*(1/(1 -x))’ =6*(0 - (-1))/(1 -x)^2=6/(1 -x)^2. Therefore, f’(x)=1 +6/(1 -x)^2. Since (1 -x)^2 is always positive, the derivative is always greater than 1. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing on [-2,0). Therefore, |f(x)|=f(x) is increasing on [-2,0). So option B is correct for both intervals. So B is correct.Wait, but hold on. Let&#39;s confirm this. For x in [-2,0), f’(x)=1 +6/(1 -x)^2. Since 1 -x is greater than 1 because x is negative. For example, if x=-2, 1 -(-2)=3, so 1 -x=3. Then (1 -x)^2=9, so f’(-2)=1 +6/9=1 +2/3≈1.666. If x approaches 0 from the left, 1 -x approaches1, so (1 -x)^2 approaches1, so f’(x) approaches1 +6/1=7. So the derivative is always greater than 1, meaning f(x) is increasing on [-2,0). Therefore, |f(x)|=f(x) is increasing there. Similarly, on [2, ∞), as we saw earlier, f(x) is increasing from f(2)=0 upwards, so |f(x)|=f(x) is increasing. Therefore, B is correct.Now, moving on to option D: The solution set of x f(x) &lt;0 is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Let&#39;s analyze this inequality. x f(x) &lt;0. The product of x and f(x) is negative when x and f(x) have opposite signs.First, let&#39;s consider the regions divided by the sign changes.We know that f(x) is odd, so let&#39;s analyze the sign of f(x) in different intervals.For x &gt;0: f(x)=x -6/(x +1). Let&#39;s find where f(x) is positive or negative. Let&#39;s find the zeros of f(x) for x &gt;0.Set x -6/(x +1)=0. Multiply both sides by (x +1):x(x +1) -6=0 → x² +x -6=0 → x = [-1 ±√(1 +24)]/2 = [-1 ±5]/2. Since x&gt;0, x=( -1 +5 )/2=4/2=2. So f(x)=0 at x=2. For x &gt;2, let&#39;s test x=3: f(3)=3 -6/4=3 -1.5=1.5&gt;0. For x between 0 and2, say x=1: f(1)=1 -6/2=1 -3= -2&lt;0. Therefore, on (0,2), f(x) is negative; on (2, ∞), f(x) is positive.For x &lt;0, since f is odd, f(x)= -f(-x). So when x &lt;0, the sign of f(x) is opposite to f(-x). For x in (-2,0), which is -x in (0,2), where f(-x) is negative, so f(x)= -f(-x) is positive. For x &lt; -2, -x &gt;2, where f(-x) is positive, so f(x)= -f(-x) is negative.So summarizing:- For x &gt;2: f(x) &gt;0- For x=2: f(x)=0- For 0 &lt;x &lt;2: f(x) &lt;0- For x=0: f(x)=0- For -2 &lt;x &lt;0: f(x) &gt;0- For x &lt; -2: f(x) &lt;0Now, x f(x) &lt;0. Let&#39;s check each interval:1. x &gt;2: x positive, f(x) positive → product positive → not part of solution.2. x=2: x positive, f(x)=0 → product 0 → not part of solution.3. 0 &lt;x &lt;2: x positive, f(x) negative → product negative → part of solution.4. x=0: product 0 → not part of solution.5. -2 &lt;x &lt;0: x negative, f(x) positive → product negative → part of solution.6. x &lt; -2: x negative, f(x) negative → product positive → not part of solution.Therefore, the solution set is (0,2) ∪ (-2,0), which is the same as (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). So D is correct. However, let&#39;s check if x=0 is included. But x=0 makes the product 0, so it&#39;s excluded. So D is correct.Wait, but the original problem says &quot;the solution set of x f(x) &lt;0 is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2)&quot;. But according to our analysis, that&#39;s exactly the case. So D is correct. Wait, but the user might have ordered the intervals as (-2,0) first, which is the same as (0,2) ∪ (-2,0). So order doesn&#39;t matter in unions. So D is correct.But hold on, let&#39;s check x=-2. At x=-2, f(-2)= -f(2)= -0=0. So f(-2)=0, so x f(x)= (-2)(0)=0. So x=-2 is not included. Similarly, x=2 is excluded. So the solution set is indeed (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Therefore, D is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D.Wait, but the original options were A, B, C, D. We determined A is incorrect, B is correct, C is correct, D is correct. So the answer should be B, C, D.But let me double-check everything once again to be sure.Starting with A: f(0) = -6. But since f is odd, f(0) must be 0. So A is wrong.C: For x &lt;0, f(x) =x +6/(1 -x). We derived that using the oddness, and it matches. So C is correct.B: |f(x)| is increasing on [-2,0) and [2, ∞). For [-2,0), we showed that f(x) is positive and increasing, so |f(x)|=f(x) is increasing. For [2, ∞), f(x) is positive and increasing, so |f(x)|=f(x) is increasing. So B is correct.D: x f(x) &lt;0 solution set is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). As analyzed, yes. So D is correct.Therefore, the correct answers are B, C, D.Final AnswerThe correct conclusions are boxed{BC}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that the function ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on ( mathbb{R} ), and when ( x &gt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x - frac{6}{x+1} ). We need to determine which of the given conclusions are correct.Conclusion A: ( f(0) = -6 )An odd function satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ). For ( x = 0 ), this implies ( f(0) = -f(0) ), which can only be true if ( f(0) = 0 ). Therefore, ( f(0) = -6 ) is incorrect. Conclusion C: When ( x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x + frac{6}{1-x} )For ( x &lt; 0 ), using the property of odd functions, ( f(x) = -f(-x) ). Since ( -x &gt; 0 ), we substitute into the given function:[ f(-x) = (-x) - frac{6}{(-x) + 1} = -x - frac{6}{1 - x} ]Thus,[ f(x) = -f(-x) = x + frac{6}{1 - x} ]This matches the given expression for ( x &lt; 0 ), so conclusion C is correct.Conclusion B: ( |f(x)| ) is monotonically increasing on the intervals ([-2, 0)) and ([2, +infty))For ( x &gt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x - frac{6}{x+1} ). The derivative is:[ f&#39;(x) = 1 + frac{6}{(x+1)^2} ]which is always positive, indicating ( f(x) ) is increasing. For ( x geq 2 ), ( f(x) ) is positive and increasing, so ( |f(x)| = f(x) ) is increasing.For ( x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x + frac{6}{1-x} ). The derivative is:[ f&#39;(x) = 1 + frac{6}{(1-x)^2} ]which is always positive, indicating ( f(x) ) is increasing. For ( -2 leq x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) ) is positive and increasing, so ( |f(x)| = f(x) ) is increasing. Therefore, conclusion B is correct.Conclusion D: The solution set of ( x f(x) &lt; 0 ) is ((-2, 0) cup (0, 2))Analyzing the sign of ( f(x) ):- For ( x &gt; 2 ), ( f(x) &gt; 0 )- For ( 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 ), ( f(x) &lt; 0 )- For ( -2 &lt; x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) &gt; 0 )- For ( x &lt; -2 ), ( f(x) &lt; 0 )The product ( x f(x) &lt; 0 ) when:- ( 0 &lt; x &lt; 2 ) (positive ( x ), negative ( f(x) ))- ( -2 &lt; x &lt; 0 ) (negative ( x ), positive ( f(x) ))Thus, the solution set is ((-2, 0) cup (0, 2)), making conclusion D correct.Final Answerboxed{BC},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, D are correct for the given odd function f(x). Let me start by recalling what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. Also, since it&#39;s defined on all real numbers, that means f(0) should be 0 because for x=0, f(-0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = -f(0), which can only be true if f(0) = 0. So right away, option A says f(0) = -6, which contradicts the property of odd functions. Therefore, A must be incorrect. Let me check that again. If x=0, then f(0) = -f(0) implies 2f(0) = 0, so f(0) = 0. Yep, so A is definitely wrong.Moving on to option C: When x &lt; 0, f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). Since the function is odd, for x &lt; 0, we can write f(x) = -f(-x). Since when x &gt; 0, f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1), then for x &lt; 0, f(x) should be -[ (-x) - 6/( (-x) + 1 ) ] because we replace x with -x. Let&#39;s compute that:f(x) = -[ (-x) - 6/(-x + 1) ] = -[ -x - 6/(1 - x) ] = x + 6/(1 - x). So that matches exactly what option C says. Therefore, C is correct.Now, let&#39;s look at option B: |f(x)| is monotonically increasing on the intervals [-2, 0) and [2, +∞). Hmm. To check monotonicity, we need to look at the derivative of |f(x)|. But first, let&#39;s get expressions for f(x) in both regions. For x &gt; 0, f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1). For x &lt; 0, f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x) as per option C, which we just confirmed. Also, since it&#39;s an odd function, the behavior on the negative side is related to the positive side.First, let&#39;s analyze f(x) for x &gt; 0. Let&#39;s compute its derivative. f&#39;(x) = 1 - 6 * (-1)/(x + 1)^2 = 1 + 6/(x + 1)^2. Since (x + 1)^2 is always positive, the derivative f&#39;(x) is always greater than 1. So f(x) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞). Since it&#39;s increasing, |f(x)| will depend on whether f(x) is positive or negative. Let&#39;s see where f(x) is positive or negative for x &gt; 0.Compute f(x) when x approaches 0 from the right: lim_{x→0+} f(x) = 0 - 6/(0 + 1) = -6. Then as x increases, since the function is increasing, f(x) goes from -6 upwards. Let&#39;s find when f(x) becomes 0. Solve x - 6/(x + 1) = 0. Multiply both sides by (x + 1):x(x + 1) - 6 = 0 =&gt; x^2 + x - 6 = 0. Solving: x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 24)]/2 = [-1 ± 5]/2. So x = (-1 + 5)/2 = 2 or x = (-1 - 5)/2 = -3. Since x &gt; 0, the root is x = 2. Therefore, for x &gt; 0, f(x) is negative on (0, 2) and positive on (2, ∞). Thus, |f(x)| would be -f(x) on (0, 2) and f(x) on (2, ∞).Therefore, for x in (0, 2), |f(x)| = -f(x) = -x + 6/(x + 1). Let&#39;s compute its derivative: d/dx |f(x)| = derivative of (-x + 6/(x + 1)) = -1 - 6/(x + 1)^2. That&#39;s definitely negative, so |f(x)| is decreasing on (0, 2). On (2, ∞), |f(x)| = f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1), derivative is 1 + 6/(x + 1)^2, which is positive. Therefore, |f(x)| is increasing on (2, ∞). But the question says &quot;monotonically increasing on [2, +∞)&quot;, which aligns with our result. So for x &gt;= 2, |f(x)| is increasing.Now, let&#39;s check the interval [-2, 0). Since the function is odd, the behavior on the negative side should mirror the positive side. Let&#39;s consider x in [-2, 0). Then, since x is negative, let&#39;s write x = -y where y &gt; 0. So f(x) = f(-y) = -f(y) = -[y - 6/(y + 1)]. So |f(x)| = | - [y - 6/(y + 1)] | = |f(y)|. Since y is in (0, 2] when x is in [-2, 0). From earlier, on y in (0, 2), f(y) is negative, so |f(y)| = -f(y). Then, since we found that |f(y)| is decreasing on (0, 2), which corresponds to |f(x)| on x in (-2, 0) being decreasing as well. Wait, but the question says &quot;monotonically increasing on [-2,0)&quot;. Hmm, so if |f(x)| on the negative side corresponds to |f(y)| where y is in (0, 2], and we saw that |f(y)| is decreasing on (0, 2), then |f(x)| on x in [-2, 0) would be decreasing as well. Therefore, the function |f(x)| is decreasing on [-2, 0) and increasing on [2, ∞). Therefore, option B says it&#39;s monotonically increasing on both intervals, which is only true for [2, ∞) but false for [-2, 0). Therefore, B is incorrect.Wait, but maybe I need to check the derivative directly on the negative side. Let&#39;s compute |f(x)| for x &lt; 0. Since f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). Let&#39;s see where f(x) is positive or negative for x &lt; 0. Let&#39;s plug in x = -2: f(-2) = -2 + 6/(1 - (-2)) = -2 + 6/3 = -2 + 2 = 0. For x approaching 0 from the left, x approaches 0-, so f(x) = 0 + 6/(1 - 0) = 6. Wait, hold on. Wait, f(x) when x is approaching 0 from the left: x approaches 0-, so f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). So plugging x approaching 0-: f(x) approaches 0 + 6/1 = 6. So at x approaching 0-, f(x) approaches 6. At x = -2, f(-2) = 0. So between x = -2 and x = 0, f(x) goes from 0 to 6. Since f(x) is increasing? Wait, let&#39;s check the derivative for x &lt; 0.f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). Compute derivative: f&#39;(x) = 1 + 6/(1 - x)^2. Because derivative of 6/(1 - x) is 6/(1 - x)^2. So f&#39;(x) = 1 + 6/(1 - x)^2. Since (1 - x)^2 is positive, this derivative is always positive. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on x &lt; 0. Therefore, on x in [-2, 0), f(x) is increasing from f(-2)=0 to f(0)=0. Wait, hold on, but earlier when x approaches 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 6? Wait, wait, there&#39;s a mistake here. Wait, if x is approaching 0 from the left (x approaches 0-), then f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). So x approaches 0, so x is near 0, so 1 - x is near 1. Therefore, 6/(1 - x) is near 6. So f(x) approaches 0 + 6 = 6. But f(0) is 0. Wait, this is a contradiction. But the function is defined on all real numbers, and it&#39;s odd. But we have a problem here because approaching 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 6, but f(0) is 0. That&#39;s a jump discontinuity at 0. But the problem states that f(x) is defined on all real numbers. Hmm, this must be a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, no. Wait, the original definition is that f(x) is an odd function defined on R. When x &gt; 0, f(x) = x - 6/(x + 1). Then for x &lt; 0, f(x) is defined as -f(-x) = -[ (-x) - 6/(-x + 1) ] = x + 6/(1 - x). Therefore, f(x) is defined piecewise, with x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 0. At x = 0, since it&#39;s an odd function, f(0) = 0. But according to the expression for x approaching 0 from the left, f(x) approaches 6, but f(0) is 0. Therefore, there&#39;s a discontinuity at x = 0. Wait, but the problem didn&#39;t state that f is continuous, just that it&#39;s defined on R. However, odd functions typically are considered with continuity at 0 unless specified otherwise. But if it&#39;s defined as odd, then even if there&#39;s a discontinuity, f(0) must be 0. But in reality, when you define an odd function piecewise like this, unless specified, there could be a jump discontinuity at 0. But in standard practice, odd functions are usually continuous unless stated otherwise. Wait, but according to the problem statement, it&#39;s an odd function defined on all of R. So if f is defined as x - 6/(x + 1) for x &gt; 0, then for x &lt; 0, f(x) = -f(-x) = -[ (-x) - 6/(-x + 1) ] = x + 6/(1 - x). Then, at x = 0, f(0) = 0. However, the left-hand limit as x approaches 0 from the negative side is 0 + 6/(1 - 0) = 6, and the right-hand limit as x approaches 0 from the positive side is 0 - 6/(0 + 1) = -6. Therefore, the function has a jump discontinuity at x = 0. But the problem says it&#39;s defined on all R, so f(0) = 0, but the function is discontinuous at 0. Is that allowed? The problem doesn&#39;t specify continuity, just that it&#39;s defined on R and odd. So such a function is possible. So the left-hand limit is 6, right-hand limit is -6, and f(0) is 0. So, the function is indeed discontinuous at 0. But that&#39;s okay per the problem&#39;s statement.Therefore, going back, for x &lt; 0, f(x) is x + 6/(1 - x), which we&#39;ve derived. So, for x in [-2, 0), f(x) is increasing because derivative is 1 + 6/(1 - x)^2, which is positive. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (-∞, 0). But since f(-2) = 0 and approaching x approaching 0-, f(x) approaches 6. So on [-2, 0), f(x) increases from 0 to 6. Therefore, |f(x)| is the same as f(x) in this interval because f(x) is non-negative here. So |f(x)| = f(x), which is increasing on [-2, 0). However, the problem says &quot;monotonically increasing on [-2, 0)&quot;, which is correct because f(x) is increasing here, so |f(x)| is increasing as well. Wait, but earlier, when we looked at x &gt; 0, the |f(x)| on (0, 2) was decreasing because f(x) was negative there, so |f(x)| = -f(x), whose derivative was negative, hence decreasing. But on the negative side, for x in [-2, 0), f(x) is increasing from 0 to 6, so |f(x)| is also increasing. Therefore, option B says &quot;monotonically increasing on [-2, 0) and [2, +∞)&quot;. From our analysis, on [-2, 0), |f(x)| is increasing because f(x) is increasing and non-negative there. On [2, +∞), |f(x)| = f(x), which is increasing because f(x) is increasing there as well. Therefore, option B is correct? Wait, but earlier I thought that on the positive side, |f(x)| is decreasing on (0, 2) and increasing on (2, ∞). So the interval [2, ∞) is correct for increasing. Then, on the negative side, the interval [-2, 0) corresponds to |f(x)| increasing because f(x) is going from 0 up to 6, so |f(x)| is indeed increasing there. Therefore, B is correct? Hmm, but earlier I thought B was incorrect. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me recap. For x in [-2, 0), f(x) is increasing from f(-2) = 0 to f(0^-) = 6. Since f(x) is increasing, and since |f(x)| = f(x) in this interval (as f(x) is non-negative there), then |f(x)| is increasing. Therefore, on [-2, 0), |f(x)| is monotonically increasing. For x in [2, ∞), f(x) is positive and increasing, so |f(x)| = f(x), which is increasing. Therefore, B is correct. So why did I earlier think B was incorrect? Because I confused the negative side with the positive side. Wait, so in x in [-2, 0), |f(x)| is increasing. In x in [2, ∞), |f(x)| is increasing. So both intervals are correct. So option B is correct? Then why earlier when I considered the mirror image, did I think it was decreasing? Wait, no. Wait, when x is in (0, 2), f(x) is negative, so |f(x)| = -f(x), which was decreasing. But on the negative side, when x is in (-2, 0), f(x) is positive (since f(-2) = 0 and f(x) approaches 6 as x approaches 0 from the left), so |f(x)| = f(x), which is increasing. Therefore, the intervals [-2,0) and [2, ∞) are both where |f(x)| is increasing. Therefore, option B is correct. But in my initial analysis, I thought of x in (0, 2) being decreasing, which is true, but B is not talking about (0, 2). It&#39;s talking about [-2,0) and [2, ∞). So B is correct. Therefore, I need to check again.Wait, but for x in [-2, 0), the function |f(x)| is increasing. For x in [2, ∞), |f(x)| is increasing. So both intervals are correct. Therefore, option B is correct. But earlier when I thought about x in (0, 2), |f(x)| is decreasing. That is correct, but B is not making any claim about that interval. Therefore, my initial reasoning was flawed because I confused the intervals. So B is correct? Let me verify with numbers. Take x in [-2, 0). For example, x = -2: f(-2) = 0, so |f(-2)| = 0. x = -1: f(-1) = -1 + 6/(1 - (-1)) = -1 + 6/2 = -1 + 3 = 2. So |f(-1)| = 2. x = -0.5: f(-0.5) = -0.5 + 6/(1 - (-0.5)) = -0.5 + 6/(1.5) = -0.5 + 4 = 3.5. So |f(-0.5)| = 3.5. As x approaches 0 from the left, |f(x)| approaches 6. So indeed, from x=-2 to x approaching 0, |f(x)| increases from 0 to 6. Therefore, on [-2,0), |f(x)| is increasing.For x in [2, ∞): take x=2, f(2) = 2 - 6/3 = 2 - 2 = 0. Then x=3: f(3)=3 - 6/4 = 3 - 1.5=1.5. x=4: f(4)=4 - 6/5=4 -1.2=2.8. So |f(x)| is increasing here as well. Therefore, B is correct.Wait, so now I&#39;m confused because earlier I thought B was incorrect but upon rechecking, it&#39;s correct. Therefore, B is correct. Then what was my mistake before? Initially, I thought that since on (0,2), |f(x)| is decreasing, but B doesn&#39;t mention that interval. It mentions [-2,0) and [2, ∞), which are both increasing. Therefore, B is correct. So then, my initial conclusion was wrong. Therefore, B is correct. Therefore, B is correct.Now, moving on to option D: The solution set of x f(x) &lt; 0 is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Let&#39;s analyze x f(x) &lt; 0. This inequality holds when x and f(x) have opposite signs.First, let&#39;s analyze the sign of f(x):For x &gt; 0:- On (0, 2), f(x) is negative (as we found earlier, crosses zero at x=2).- On (2, ∞), f(x) is positive.For x &lt; 0:- On (-∞, -2), since f(x) is odd, f(x) = -f(-x). If x &lt; -2, then -x &gt; 2, so f(-x) is positive, so f(x) = -f(-x) is negative.- On (-2, 0), f(x) is positive (since approaching 0 from left, f(x) approaches 6, and at x=-2, f(-2)=0).At x = -2, f(-2) = 0; x=0, f(0)=0; x=2, f(2)=0.Therefore, the sign chart for f(x):- x &lt; -2: f(x) negative- -2 &lt; x &lt; 0: f(x) positive- 0 &lt; x &lt; 2: f(x) negative- x &gt; 2: f(x) positiveNow, x f(x) &lt; 0 when x and f(x) have opposite signs.Case 1: x &gt; 0 and f(x) &lt; 0. This is when 0 &lt; x &lt; 2.Case 2: x &lt; 0 and f(x) &gt; 0. This is when -2 &lt; x &lt; 0.Therefore, the solution set is (-2, 0) ∪ (0, 2). But note that at x = -2, x f(x) = (-2)*0 = 0; at x=0, x f(x)=0*0=0; at x=2, x f(x)=2*0=0. So the inequality is strict (&lt;0), so the solution set is indeed (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Therefore, D is correct.So, summarizing:A: Incorrect, since f(0)=0.B: Correct, |f(x)| is increasing on [-2,0) and [2, ∞).C: Correct, as per odd function derivation.D: Correct, solution set is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2).But wait, the original options are A, B, C, D. The problem says &quot;which of the following conclusions are correct&quot;. The answer choices are given, and I need to see which ones are correct.But according to my analysis:A: Wrong.B: Correct.C: Correct.D: Correct.But let me cross-verify with my initial thoughts. Wait, initially I thought B was incorrect, but upon rechecking, realized it&#39;s correct. So the correct options are B, C, D. But let me check again.Wait, the problem is in Chinese, but the user hasn&#39;t specified, but the original problem probably has multiple correct options. So according to my analysis, options B, C, D are correct. But let me check again.Option C: When x &lt; 0, f(x) = x + 6/(1 - x). As we derived earlier, yes, because f(-x) = -x -6/( -x +1 ) =&gt; -f(-x) = x +6/(1 -x ). So C is correct.Option D: Solution set is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Which we confirmed. So D is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D.But let me check if the problem is from a source where perhaps multiple options can be correct. So the answer should be options B, C, D. However, let me check one more thing for option B: is |f(x)| monotonically increasing on [-2,0) and [2, +inf)?On [-2,0):We saw that f(x) increases from 0 to 6, so |f(x)| = f(x) which is increasing. Therefore, it&#39;s monotonically increasing on [-2,0).On [2, +infty):f(x) increases from 0 to infinity, since f(x) = x -6/(x +1), and as x approaches infinity, f(x) ~ x. So |f(x)| = f(x), which is increasing. Therefore, on [2, +infty), |f(x)| is increasing. So yes, B is correct.Therefore, B, C, D are correct. A is incorrect.But let me check if the original problem perhaps had different options. Wait, the user lists options A, B, C, D. So in the problem, all three options B, C, D are correct. Therefore, the answer is B, C, D. But let me confirm once more.Wait, let me check the derivative of |f(x)| on [-2,0):Since f(x) is positive and increasing there, |f(x)| = f(x), so the derivative is f&#39;(x) =1 +6/(1 -x)^2, which is positive. So yes, increasing.On [2, ∞): |f(x)| = f(x), derivative is 1 +6/(x +1)^2, positive. So increasing.Therefore, B is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D.But wait, let me check once again for x &lt; -2.For x &lt; -2, how is f(x) behaving? For x &lt; -2, f(x) = x +6/(1 -x). Let me plug in x = -3: f(-3) = -3 +6/(1 - (-3)) = -3 +6/4 = -3 + 1.5 = -1.5. x = -4: f(-4) = -4 +6/(1 - (-4))= -4 +6/5= -4 +1.2= -2.8. So as x becomes more negative, f(x) =x +6/(1 -x) becomes more negative because x dominates. Therefore, for x &lt; -2, f(x) is negative and decreasing (since derivative is 1 +6/(1 -x)^2, which is positive, so the function is increasing. Wait, wait, for x &lt; -2, f(x) is increasing because derivative is 1 +6/(1 -x)^2. Wait, but plugging x = -3, derivative is 1 +6/(1 - (-3))^2=1 +6/16=1.375, positive. So f(x) is increasing on x &lt; -2. So for x &lt; -2, even though f(x) is negative, it&#39;s increasing towards -2. At x = -2, f(-2) =0. So from x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches -infty, and increases to 0 at x=-2. So in the interval (-infty, -2), f(x) is increasing from -infty to 0. But |f(x)| = |x +6/(1 -x)|. Since f(x) is negative here, |f(x)| = -f(x) = -x -6/(1 -x). The derivative of |f(x)| would then be derivative of (-x -6/(1 -x)) = -1 -6/(1 -x)^2. Which is negative. Therefore, |f(x)| is decreasing on (-infty, -2). But option B doesn&#39;t mention that interval. So option B only claims that |f(x)| is increasing on [-2,0) and [2, ∞). Which is correct. Therefore, B is correct.Therefore, the correct options are B, C, D.But wait, the original problem might have options where multiple are correct, but I need to check again. The user hasn&#39;t specified if multiple can be correct, but given it&#39;s a Chinese problem, likely multiple can be correct.But let me check D: solution set of x f(x) &lt;0 is (-2,0) ∪ (0,2). Which we saw: x f(x) &lt;0 when x and f(x) have opposite signs. So for x in (-2,0), f(x) &gt;0, x &lt;0: product negative. For x in (0,2), f(x) &lt;0, x &gt;0: product negative. At x=0, product is 0. At x=-2 and x=2, product is 0. So yes, D is correct.So all in all, options B, C, D are correct. A is wrong.Final Answerboxed{BCD}&lt;/think&gt;Given that the function ( f(x) ) is an odd function defined on ( mathbb{R} ), and when ( x &gt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x - frac{6}{x+1} ). We need to determine which of the given conclusions are correct.Analysis of each option:A: ( f(0) = -6 )An odd function satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for all ( x ). For ( x = 0 ), this implies ( f(0) = -f(0) ), which means ( f(0) = 0 ). Therefore, A is incorrect.C: When ( x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x + frac{6}{1-x} )Since ( f ) is odd, ( f(x) = -f(-x) ). For ( x &lt; 0 ), let ( x = -y ) where ( y &gt; 0 ). Then,[f(-y) = -f(y) = -left( y - frac{6}{y+1} right) = -y + frac{6}{y+1} = -y + frac{6}{1 - (-y)} = x + frac{6}{1 - x}]Thus, C is correct.B: ( |f(x)| ) is monotonically increasing on ([-2,0)) and ([2,+infty))- For ( x &gt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x - frac{6}{x+1} ). The derivative is ( f&#39;(x) = 1 + frac{6}{(x+1)^2} ), which is positive, so ( f(x) ) is increasing. For ( x geq 2 ), ( f(x) geq 0 ), so ( |f(x)| = f(x) ), which is increasing.- For ( x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) = x + frac{6}{1-x} ). The derivative is ( f&#39;(x) = 1 + frac{6}{(1-x)^2} ), which is positive, so ( f(x) ) is increasing. For ( x in [-2, 0) ), ( f(x) ) ranges from 0 to 6, so ( |f(x)| = f(x) ), which is increasing.Thus, B is correct.D: The solution set of ( x f(x) &lt; 0 ) is ((-2,0) cup (0,2))- For ( x &gt; 0 ), ( f(x) ) is negative on ( (0, 2) ) and positive on ( (2, infty) ).- For ( x &lt; 0 ), ( f(x) ) is positive on ( (-2, 0) ) and negative on ( (-infty, -2) ).The product ( x f(x) ) is negative when ( x ) and ( f(x) ) have opposite signs:- ( x in (-2, 0) cup (0, 2) ).Thus, D is correct.Final Answerboxed{BCD}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🔑:</span>Let&#39;s analyze each option step by step, following the rules and structure provided.Option A: f(0) = -6Given that f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-x) = -f(x).

I need to find the range of x such that g(2x - 1) is less than g(3). First, let me make sure I understand the problem. The function g(x) is given as 2^x + 2^(-x) + |x|. So, I need to evaluate g at 2x - 1 and compare it to g at 3. Then find all x where g(2x - 1) is less than g(3). First, maybe I should compute what g(3) is. Let&#39;s do that first. So, substituting x = 3 into the function:g(3) = 2^3 + 2^(-3) + |3|. Calculating each term:2^3 is 8, 2^(-3) is 1/8, and |3| is 3. So adding those together: 8 + 1/8 + 3. That would be 11 + 1/8, which is 11.125. So, g(3) is 11.125. Now, I need to find g(2x - 1). Let&#39;s write that out:g(2x - 1) = 2^(2x - 1) + 2^(-(2x - 1)) + |2x - 1|. Simplify that expression. Let&#39;s break it down:First term: 2^(2x - 1). That&#39;s the same as (2^(2x)) / 2^1 = (4^x)/2.Second term: 2^(-2x + 1) = 2^(1 - 2x) = 2^1 / 2^(2x) = 2 / (4^x).Third term: |2x - 1|. So putting it all together:g(2x - 1) = (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x) + |2x - 1|.So the inequality we need to solve is:(4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x) + |2x - 1| &lt; 11.125.Hmm. That seems a bit complicated. Let&#39;s see if we can simplify this or find a way to approach it. Maybe consider substitution. Let&#39;s let y = 4^x. Since 4^x is always positive, y &gt; 0. Then 2/(4^x) = 2/y. So the first two terms become y/2 + 2/y. Then the inequality becomes:y/2 + 2/y + |2x - 1| &lt; 11.125.But since y = 4^x, x = log4(y) = (ln y)/(ln 4). However, this substitution might complicate things because we still have the absolute value term in terms of x, which is in terms of y. Maybe not the best approach. Let&#39;s think differently.Alternatively, note that 4^x + 4^{-x} is a common expression. Since 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}, and similarly 4^{-x} = 2^{-2x}. But in our case, the first two terms of g(2x -1) are (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x). Let&#39;s see if we can relate this to 4^x + 4^{-x}.Let me compute (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x). Let&#39;s factor out a 1/2:(1/2)(4^x + 4/(4^x)) = (1/2)(4^x + 4^{1 - x}).Hmm, maybe that&#39;s not immediately helpful. Alternatively, notice that 4^x / 2 = (2^{2x}) / 2 = 2^{2x -1}, and 2 / 4^x = 2^{1 - 2x}, so the first two terms can be written as 2^{2x -1} + 2^{1 - 2x}. That&#39;s similar to the original function g(x) but with different exponents. Wait, the original function g(x) is 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x|. So, actually, the first two terms of g(2x -1) are similar to g evaluated at some other point. Let&#39;s see:If we have 2^{a} + 2^{-a}, that&#39;s part of g(a). So here, a is 2x -1. Wait, no. Wait, in g(2x -1), the exponent in the first term is 2x -1, but in the first two terms here, it&#39;s 2x -1 and -(2x -1). Wait, actually, the first two terms of g(2x -1) are exactly 2^{2x -1} + 2^{-(2x -1)}. Which is the same as g(2x -1) minus |2x -1|. Wait, no. The original function g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x|. So if you substitute x with (2x -1), you get 2^{2x -1} + 2^{-(2x -1)} + |2x -1|. Which is exactly the expression we have. So, in that case, the first two terms are 2^{2x -1} + 2^{-(2x -1)}. Let me see if there&#39;s a way to analyze this.Alternatively, note that 2^{2x -1} + 2^{-2x +1} can be written as (2^{2x}/2) + (2^{1}/2^{2x}) = (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x). Let&#39;s denote z = 4^x. Then, those two terms become z/2 + 2/z. Let&#39;s analyze z/2 + 2/z. For z &gt; 0, the minimum of this expression occurs where derivative is zero. Let&#39;s compute derivative: (1/2) - (2)/z^2. Setting to zero: (1/2) - 2/z^2 = 0 → 1/2 = 2/z^2 → z^2 = 4 → z = 2 (since z &gt; 0). So the minimum is at z = 2, which is 2/2 + 2/2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the first two terms z/2 + 2/z have a minimum value of 2 when z = 2. Since z = 4^x, that corresponds to 4^x = 2 → x = log4(2) = 1/2. So when x = 1/2, the first two terms of g(2x -1) are minimized at 2. Then, adding the |2x -1| term. So when x = 1/2, |2x -1| = |1 -1| = 0. Therefore, at x = 1/2, g(2x -1) = 2 + 0 = 2. But wait, that can&#39;t be right, because when x = 1/2, 2x -1 = 0, so g(0) = 2^0 + 2^0 + |0| = 1 +1 +0 = 2. Yes, that&#39;s correct. So g(0) = 2, which is indeed the minimum of the function? Wait, is that the case?Wait, let&#39;s check the original function g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x|. The terms 2^x + 2^{-x} are minimized when x=0, since that&#39;s a symmetric function about x=0, and the minimum occurs there. At x=0, 2^0 + 2^0 = 2. Then |x| is also minimized at x=0. So, yes, the entire function g(x) has its minimum at x=0, which is 2 + 0 = 2. Therefore, g(x) is minimized at x=0 with value 2, and increases as |x| increases. So, the function is even? Wait, no, because of the |x| term. Let&#39;s see, for x positive and negative. Let&#39;s check for x and -x. For x positive: g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + x. For x negative: g(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^{x} + |-x| = same as g(x). Wait, no. Wait, if x is negative, say x = -a where a &gt;0, then g(-a) = 2^{-a} + 2^{a} + | -a | = 2^{a} + 2^{-a} + a. Which is the same as g(a). So the function g(x) is even, because g(-x) = g(x). Therefore, symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, it&#39;s sufficient to analyze it for x ≥0, and mirror the results for x &lt;0. But in our problem, we need to analyze g(2x -1). So, when x varies over all real numbers, 2x -1 also varies over all real numbers. Therefore, the argument of g can be any real number. So, the function g(2x -1) is a composition of the function g with the linear function 2x -1.So, to solve g(2x -1) &lt; g(3), we can think of it as g(y) &lt; g(3) where y = 2x -1. So, the inequality is equivalent to g(y) &lt; g(3). So, we need to find all y such that g(y) &lt; g(3), and then since y = 2x -1, find x such that y = 2x -1 satisfies g(y) &lt; g(3).So, perhaps first solve for y: g(y) &lt; g(3). Then, once we have the range for y, convert back to x via x = (y +1)/2.Therefore, first step: find all real numbers y where 2^y + 2^{-y} + |y| &lt; 11.125. Since g(3) is 11.125. Then, once we find such y, then set y = 2x -1 and solve for x.So, maybe this approach is better. Let&#39;s proceed.First, compute g(3) = 8 + 1/8 + 3 = 11 + 1/8 = 11.125.We need to find y such that 2^y + 2^{-y} + |y| &lt; 11.125.Let me analyze the function g(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y} + |y|. As mentioned before, it&#39;s even, so symmetric about y=0. Let&#39;s consider y ≥0 first.For y ≥0: g(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y} + y. Let&#39;s analyze this function. The term 2^y + 2^{-y} is equal to 2*cosh(y ln 2), which is a hypergeometric function that is minimized at y=0, where it equals 2, and increases as |y| increases. The |y| term is just y for y ≥0. So, for y ≥0, g(y) is 2*cosh(y ln2) + y, which is a sum of an increasing function (since cosh is increasing for y&gt;0) and another increasing function (y). Therefore, for y ≥0, g(y) is strictly increasing. Similarly, for y ≤0, since the function is even, it&#39;s decreasing for y &lt;0.Therefore, since g(y) is even and increasing for y &gt;0, the minimum occurs at y=0, and as |y| increases, g(y) increases. Therefore, the equation g(y) = 11.125 will have two solutions: one positive and one negative. Then, the inequality g(y) &lt; 11.125 will hold for y between these two solutions.So, let&#39;s find the positive solution first. Let&#39;s denote for y &gt;0, solve 2^y + 2^{-y} + y = 11.125.Similarly, due to the function being even, the negative solution will be the negative of the positive solution. But let&#39;s verify.Wait, suppose y is positive. Let me note that 2^y + 2^{-y} is symmetric, but when y is negative, since we have |y|, which becomes -y when y is negative. Wait, but since g(y) is even, as we saw before. Therefore, solving g(y) = 11.125 will have two solutions: y = a and y = -a, where a is positive. Therefore, the inequality g(y) &lt; 11.125 will hold for y in (-a, a). Therefore, once we find a such that g(a) = 11.125, then the range is (-a, a). Then, since y = 2x -1, we can relate back to x.But first, let&#39;s find a such that g(a) = 11.125. Let&#39;s note that g(3) is 11.125. So, when y=3, g(y)=11.125. Similarly, since the function is even, y=-3 will also satisfy g(-3)=g(3)=11.125. Therefore, the equation g(y) =11.125 has solutions y=3 and y=-3. Since for y&gt;0, the function is increasing, and g(3)=11.125. Therefore, the solutions are y=3 and y=-3. Therefore, the inequality g(y) &lt;11.125 holds when y is between -3 and 3. Wait, let&#39;s check.Wait, but since for y&gt;0, the function is increasing, starting from g(0)=2 and going to infinity as y→infty. Similarly, for y&lt;0, the function decreases from y=0 to y→-infty, but because it&#39;s even, actually, as y becomes more negative, |y| increases, so the function increases again. Wait, no. Wait, since the function is even, so for y&lt;0, as y becomes more negative (i.e., y approaches -infty), |y| becomes large, so the function g(y) tends to infinity. Therefore, the function g(y) is minimized at y=0, and increases as |y| increases. Therefore, the set of y where g(y) &lt;11.25 is the interval (-3,3), since at y=3 and y=-3, g(y)=11.125, and outside of that interval, g(y) would be larger. Wait, but let me verify.Wait, g(3) is 11.125. So, if the function is increasing for y&gt;0, then for y&gt;3, g(y) &gt;11.125, and for y between 0 and 3, g(y) &lt;11.125. Similarly, for y&lt;0, as the function is even, for y between -3 and 0, g(y) &lt;11.125, and for y &lt; -3, g(y) &gt;11.125. Therefore, the solution set is y ∈ (-3, 3). Therefore, the inequality g(y) &lt;11.125 is equivalent to y ∈ (-3,3).Therefore, returning to the original problem. We have y =2x -1. Therefore, we need 2x -1 ∈ (-3,3). So:-3 &lt; 2x -1 &lt; 3Adding 1 to all parts:-3 +1 &lt; 2x &lt;3 +1-2 &lt; 2x &lt;4Divide by 2:-1 &lt;x &lt;2Therefore, the solution is x ∈ (-1, 2). Therefore, the range of x satisfying g(2x -1) &lt;g(3) is (-1,2).Wait, but let&#39;s verify if this is correct. Let&#39;s check with x=2. At x=2, 2x -1=3, so g(3)=11.125. The inequality is strict, so x=2 is not included. Similarly, x=-1 gives 2*(-1)-1= -3, so g(-3)=11.125, which is not less than, so x=-1 is excluded. Therefore, the open interval (-1,2). But let me test with some value inside the interval. Let&#39;s take x=0. Then, 2x -1= -1. Compute g(-1)=2^{-1} +2^{1} +| -1 | = 0.5 +2 +1=3.5. Which is less than 11.125. So that&#39;s correct.Take x=1. Then, 2x -1=1. Compute g(1)=2 +0.5 +1=3.5 &lt;11.125. Correct.Take x=1.5. Then, 2x -1=2. Compute g(2)=4 +0.25 +2=6.25 &lt;11.125. Correct.Take x approaching 2, say x=1.9. Then, 2x -1=2.8. Compute g(2.8)=2^{2.8} +2^{-2.8} +2.8. Let&#39;s approximate 2^2.8. 2^3=8, so 2^2.8≈8 / 2^{0.2}≈8 /1.1487≈6.96. Similarly, 2^{-2.8}=1/(2^2.8)≈1/6.96≈0.143. Then, adding those:≈6.96 +0.143 +2.8≈9.903 &lt;11.125. So, still less. Wait, but according to our earlier conclusion, at x=2, 2x-1=3, which gives g(3)=11.125. So, as x approaches 2 from below, 2x -1 approaches 3 from below, so g(2x -1) approaches 11.125 from below. Therefore, it&#39;s continuous here, so the inequality is maintained up to x=2, but not including it.Similarly, approaching x=-1 from above, 2x -1 approaches -3 from above. Since g(y) is symmetric, g(-3)=g(3)=11.125. So again, approaching y=-3 from above (i.e., y approaching -3 from the right), g(y) approaches 11.125 from below, so the inequality holds up to y=-3, but not including it. Therefore, the interval for y is indeed (-3,3), leading to x in (-1,2).Therefore, the answer is x ∈ (-1,2). But just to make sure there isn&#39;t any mistake in assuming that the only solutions to g(y)=11.125 are y=3 and y=-3. Let&#39;s verify with another value. Suppose y=4, compute g(4)=16 +1/16 +4≈20.0625&gt;11.125. So, y=4 is outside. What about y=2.5? Compute g(2.5)=2^{2.5} +2^{-2.5} +2.5≈5.656 +0.176 +2.5≈8.332 &lt;11.125. So, 2.5 is inside. Then y=3, as computed, gives 11.125.So, yes, the function g(y) increases from y=0 to y=3, passing through 11.125 at y=3, and similarly decreases from y=0 to y=-3, passing through 11.125 at y=-3. Therefore, the interval is indeed (-3,3). Therefore, the corresponding x values are obtained by solving -3 &lt;2x -1 &lt;3, which gives -1 &lt;x &lt;2. So, the final answer is x in (-1,2). Therefore, boxed: boxed{(-1, 2)}.Final Answerboxed{(-1, 2)}&lt;/think&gt;Given the function ( g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x| ), we need to find the range of ( x ) that satisfies ( g(2x - 1) &lt; g(3) ).First, we compute ( g(3) ):[g(3) = 2^3 + 2^{-3} + |3| = 8 + frac{1}{8} + 3 = 11.125]Next, we need to analyze the inequality ( g(2x - 1) &lt; 11.125 ). We start by expressing ( g(2x - 1) ):[g(2x - 1) = 2^{2x - 1} + 2^{-(2x - 1)} + |2x - 1|]We recognize that ( g(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y} + |y| ) is an even function, symmetric about ( y = 0 ), and increases as ( |y| ) increases. The minimum value of ( g(y) ) occurs at ( y = 0 ) and is 2. The function ( g(y) ) is increasing for ( y &gt; 0 ) and decreasing for ( y &lt; 0 ).Given ( g(3) = 11.125 ), the equation ( g(y) = 11.125 ) has solutions ( y = 3 ) and ( y = -3 ) because ( g ) is even. Therefore, the inequality ( g(y) &lt; 11.125 ) holds for ( -3 &lt; y &lt; 3 ).We substitute ( y = 2x - 1 ) into the inequality ( -3 &lt; y &lt; 3 ):[-3 &lt; 2x - 1 &lt; 3]Solving for ( x ):[-3 + 1 &lt; 2x &lt; 3 + 1 implies -2 &lt; 2x &lt; 4 implies -1 &lt; x &lt; 2]Thus, the range of ( x ) that satisfies ( g(2x - 1) &lt; g(3) ) is (boxed{(-1, 2)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the range of x such that g(2x - 1) &lt; g(3), where g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x|. Hmm. First, maybe I should figure out what g(3) is. Let me calculate that.So, g(3) = 2^3 + 2^{-3} + |3|. 2^3 is 8, 2^{-3} is 1/8, and |3| is 3. Adding those up: 8 + 1/8 + 3. That&#39;s 11 + 1/8, which is 11.125. So g(3) is 11.125. Got that.Now, I need to compute g(2x - 1) and set it less than 11.125. Let&#39;s write out g(2x - 1):g(2x - 1) = 2^{2x - 1} + 2^{-(2x - 1)} + |2x - 1|.So, simplifying that a bit. Let me see. 2^{2x - 1} is the same as (2^{2x}) / 2, which is (4^x)/2. Similarly, 2^{-(2x - 1)} is 2^{1 - 2x} = 2 * 2^{-2x} = 2/(4^x). So, substituting back, we have:g(2x - 1) = (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x) + |2x - 1|.Hmm. So we need to solve (4^x)/2 + 2/(4^x) + |2x - 1| &lt; 11.125.That seems a bit complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a better way. Let me recall that the function g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x|. So, perhaps analyzing the properties of g(x) would help? For example, is g(x) increasing or decreasing? Maybe even or odd?Wait, g(-x) = 2^{-x} + 2^{x} + | -x | = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x| = g(x). So, g is an even function. That&#39;s useful. So, the function is symmetric about the y-axis. So, if I can figure out the behavior for x ≥ 0, then I can mirror it for x &lt; 0.But in our case, we have g(2x - 1) &lt; g(3). Since g is even, g(3) = g(-3), but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s immediately helpful. Let&#39;s see.Alternatively, perhaps we can write g(y) &lt; g(3), where y = 2x - 1, and find for which y this inequality holds, then relate y back to x.But first, we need to find the values of y where g(y) &lt; g(3). Since g(y) is even, we can consider y ≥ 0 and y &lt; 0 separately, but maybe not necessary yet.Wait, perhaps I can analyze the function g(y) for y in real numbers. Let&#39;s think. The function g(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y} + |y|. Let&#39;s split it into two parts: 2^y + 2^{-y} and |y|. The term 2^y + 2^{-y} is a standard hyperbola-like function, which has a minimum at y=0. Let&#39;s check its derivative. Let’s denote h(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y}. Then h’(y) = ln2 * (2^y - 2^{-y}). Setting derivative to zero, 2^y - 2^{-y}=0 =&gt; 2^y = 2^{-y} =&gt; y=0. So h(y) has a minimum at y=0, where h(0)=2. Then as |y| increases, h(y) increases. The term |y| is also minimized at y=0. So overall, the function g(y) is minimized at y=0 with g(0)=2 + 0 = 2, and it increases as |y| increases.Therefore, since g(y) is even and increases as |y| increases, the inequality g(y) &lt; g(3) would hold for all y such that |y| &lt; 3, because as |y| approaches 3, g(y) approaches g(3), and beyond that, it&#39;s larger. Wait, but is that true? Let me verify.Suppose y = 3. Then g(3) = 8 + 1/8 + 3 = 11.125 as calculated before. If y is greater than 3, say y=4, then g(4) = 16 + 1/16 + 4 = 20.0625, which is larger. Similarly, y= -4 would also give the same value. So yes, the function g(y) increases as |y| increases beyond 0. Therefore, the set of y where g(y) &lt; g(3) is all y with |y| &lt; 3.But wait, is that accurate? Let&#39;s check for y=2.9. Let&#39;s compute g(2.9):2^{2.9} + 2^{-2.9} + |2.9|. Hmm, 2^3 = 8, so 2^{2.9} is slightly less than 8. Let&#39;s approximate:2^{2.9} = e^{ln2 * 2.9} ≈ e^{0.6931*2.9} ≈ e^{2.010} ≈ 7.47. Similarly, 2^{-2.9} ≈ 1/7.47 ≈ 0.134. Then |2.9| is 2.9. So total ≈ 7.47 + 0.134 + 2.9 ≈ 10.504, which is less than 11.125. So that works.Similarly, y=3: 8 + 1/8 + 3 = 11.125. If we take y approaching 3 from the left, g(y) approaches 11.125. For y greater than 3, it&#39;s larger. For y less than -3, it&#39;s also larger because of the |y| term.Wait, but if y is negative, say y = -4, then |y| = 4, 2^{-4} + 2^{4} + 4 = 16 + 1/16 + 4 ≈ 20.0625, same as y=4. So yes, symmetric. Therefore, the inequality g(y) &lt; g(3) is equivalent to |y| &lt; 3. Therefore, if we set y = 2x - 1, then |2x - 1| &lt; 3. Solving that inequality would give the range for x.Wait, but hold on. Is it that simple? Because g(y) = h(y) + |y|, where h(y) is 2^y + 2^{-y}. If h(y) + |y| is increasing for |y| &gt; 0, then yes, the inequality g(y) &lt; g(3) would hold for |y| &lt; 3. But let&#39;s check if h(y) + |y| is strictly increasing for y &gt;0. Take the derivative of g(y) for y &gt;0. For y &gt;0, |y| = y, so g(y) = 2^y + 2^{-y} + y. The derivative is h’(y) + 1 = ln2*(2^y - 2^{-y}) +1. Since y &gt;0, 2^y &gt; 2^{-y}, so ln2*(2^y - 2^{-y}) is positive. Adding 1 makes it even more positive. Therefore, for y &gt;0, g(y) is increasing. Similarly, for y &lt;0, since it&#39;s even, the function is decreasing for y &lt;0. Therefore, the function has a minimum at y=0, and increases as |y| increases. Therefore, indeed, the inequality g(y) &lt; g(3) is equivalent to |y| &lt;3. So, substituting y=2x-1, we get |2x -1| &lt;3. Therefore, solving |2x -1| &lt;3.Let&#39;s solve that inequality. |2x -1| &lt;3 is equivalent to -3 &lt; 2x -1 &lt;3. Adding 1 to all sides: -2 &lt; 2x &lt;4. Dividing by 2: -1 &lt;x &lt;2. So, the range of x is (-1, 2).Wait, but hold on. Let me check with an example. Let&#39;s take x=2. Then 2x -1=3, so g(3) = 11.125. But the inequality is g(2x -1) &lt; g(3), so x=2 gives equality, which is not less than. Therefore, x=2 is excluded. Similarly, x=-1 gives 2*(-1) -1 = -3, so g(-3)=g(3)=11.125, which again is equality, so x=-1 is excluded. Therefore, the solution is indeed -1 &lt;x &lt;2.But wait, I should verify if this is correct. Let&#39;s pick x=0. Then 2x-1=-1. g(-1)=2^{-1} +2^{1} + |-1|=0.5 +2 +1=3.5, which is less than 11.125. So that&#39;s okay. x=1: 2(1)-1=1. g(1)=2 +0.5 +1=3.5 &lt;11.125. x=1.5: 2(1.5)-1=2. So g(2)=4 +0.25 +2=6.25 &lt;11.125. x approaching 2: 2x-1 approaching 3. So g(2x-1) approaching g(3)=11.125, so the upper bound is open. Similarly for x approaching -1: 2x -1 approaching -3, so g(-3)=11.125. So yes, the solution is -1 &lt;x &lt;2.But wait, let me check if there&#39;s a case where even though |2x -1| &gt;=3, but due to the 2^{y} +2^{-y} part maybe the sum is still less than g(3). For example, suppose y=4. Then 2^4 +2^{-4} +4=16 +0.0625 +4=20.0625&gt;11.125. If y=-4, same. If y=3.5, then 2^{3.5} +2^{-3.5} +3.5. 2^{3.5}=sqrt(2^7)=sqrt(128)≈11.3137, 2^{-3.5}=1/sqrt(128)≈0.0884, so total≈11.3137 +0.0884 +3.5≈14.902, still larger. If y= -3, same as y=3. So it seems that for |y| &gt;=3, g(y) &gt;=g(3). Therefore, the inequality g(y) &lt;g(3) is exactly when |y|&lt;3.Therefore, translating back to x, since y=2x -1, the condition is |2x -1| &lt;3, leading to -1 &lt;x &lt;2.But wait, just to be thorough, let&#39;s check if maybe for some y with |y| &gt;=3, the sum 2^y +2^{-y} +|y| could still be less than 11.125. For example, take y=3. Let&#39;s recompute g(3): 2^3 +2^{-3} +3=8 +0.125 +3=11.125. So exactly 11.125. For y=2.9, as before, approximately 10.504 &lt;11.125. For y=3.1, let&#39;s compute:2^{3.1} ≈8*2^{0.1}≈8*1.0718≈8.5742^{-3.1}=1/(2^{3.1})≈1/8.574≈0.1166|3.1|=3.1So total≈8.574 +0.1166 +3.1≈11.7906&gt;11.125. So even slightly above 3, it&#39;s already larger. Similarly, y=2.95:2^{2.95}=2^{3 -0.05}=8*2^{-0.05}≈8*0.971≈7.7682^{-2.95}=1/7.768≈0.1287|2.95|=2.95Total≈7.768 +0.1287 +2.95≈10.846, which is still less than 11.125.Wait, so 2.95 gives 10.846, which is less than 11.125. Wait, but 2.95 is less than 3. So that&#39;s consistent with |y|&lt;3. Wait, 2.95 is within the range. Then y=3.0 is the boundary. So indeed, up to y=3, it&#39;s equal, and beyond that, it&#39;s higher.Therefore, the original conclusion holds. Therefore, the solution is |2x -1| &lt;3, which gives x ∈ (-1, 2).Therefore, the answer should be boxed{(-1, 2)}.Final AnswerThe range of ( x ) that satisfies ( g(2x-1) &lt; g(3) ) is boxed{(-1, 2)}.&lt;/think&gt;To find the range of ( x ) that satisfies ( g(2x - 1) &lt; g(3) ) where ( g(x) = 2^x + 2^{-x} + |x| ):1.

Hmm, let&#39;s start breaking this down.First, P(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. So, all coefficients are integers. Also, for every positive integer n, P(n) &gt; n. So, the polynomial grows faster than the identity function at all positive integers. The sequence starts at 1 and each subsequent term is P applied to the previous term. So, x₁ = 1, x₂ = P(1), x₃ = P(P(1)), etc. The key property here is that for any N, some term in this sequence is divisible by N. That means the sequence is &quot;divergent&quot; in some modulo sense, hitting every modulus eventually. So, the sequence must cover all residues modulo every N, which seems like a very strong condition. The conclusion is that P(x) must be x + 1. So, we need to show that no other polynomial with integer coefficients satisfies these conditions.First, let&#39;s recall that if a sequence is such that every N divides some term, then the sequence must be &quot;cofinally&quot; covering all integers in some sense. So, for example, the sequence x_n must be unbounded, because otherwise, if it were bounded, say by M, then N = M+1 would not divide any term in the sequence. But since P(n) &gt; n for every n, then the sequence x_n is strictly increasing. Because starting at 1, each term is P applied to the previous, which is greater than the previous. So, x₁ = 1, x₂ = P(1) &gt; 1, x₃ = P(x₂) &gt; x₂, etc. So, the sequence is strictly increasing. Therefore, it&#39;s unbounded. So, it&#39;s going to infinity. So, that takes care of the unboundedness. But even unbounded sequences might not hit every modulus. For example, the sequence 2^n is unbounded, but all terms are even, so no odd N &gt; 1 would divide any term. So, the key here is that the sequence must have terms that are congruent to 0 mod N for every N. So, the sequence must hit every possible modulus. Therefore, the sequence is what&#39;s called &quot;divisibility-reaching&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; in some sense.Given that P is a polynomial with integer coefficients, so each x_n is an integer. Also, since P(n) &gt; n, the sequence is strictly increasing. So, we have to show that under these conditions, P(x) must be x + 1. Let&#39;s think about possible polynomials. For example, suppose P(x) = x + c, where c is a positive integer. Then the sequence would be 1, 1 + c, 1 + c + c, etc. So, arithmetic progression with difference c. Then, if c = 1, the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., which obviously contains every positive integer, hence every N divides some term. But if c &gt; 1, then the sequence is 1, 1 + c, 1 + 2c, ..., which is an arithmetic progression with difference c. In this case, the terms are congruent to 1 mod c. So, for example, if c = 2, the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., all odd numbers. Then N = 2 would not divide any term in the sequence. But according to the problem statement, the sequence must contain terms divisible by every N, so such polynomials P(x) = x + c with c &gt; 1 are invalid. Hence, only c = 1 works, which gives P(x) = x + 1. But this is a linear polynomial. The problem allows P(x) to be any polynomial with integer coefficients, so we need to rule out higher-degree polynomials as well.Suppose P(x) is a quadratic polynomial. Let&#39;s say P(x) = x^2 + 1. Then the sequence would be 1, 2, 5, 26, ... etc. Let&#39;s check if this sequence satisfies the condition. For N = 3, do any terms in the sequence 1, 2, 5, 26, ... divisible by 3? Let&#39;s compute modulo 3. x₁ = 1 mod 3. x₂ = 2 mod 3. x₃ = 5 mod 3 = 2. x₄ = P(5) = 26 mod 3 = 2. Wait, so all subsequent terms are 2 mod 3. Because P(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 ≡ 2 mod 3, and P(2) ≡ 2 mod 3, so x₃ = 2 mod 3, then x₄ = P(2) = 2 mod 3 again. So, once the sequence hits 2 mod 3, it stays there. Therefore, the sequence will never be 0 mod 3. Hence, N = 3 does not divide any term. Thus, P(x) = x^2 + 1 does not satisfy the condition, which is correct because the problem states that such a polynomial must be x + 1. So, this example shows that quadratic polynomials can fail. Similarly, higher-degree polynomials may have similar issues.But how do we prove in general that only P(x) = x + 1 works? Let&#39;s suppose that P(x) is a polynomial of degree at least 2. Then, the sequence x_n grows exponentially or even faster. However, even though it&#39;s growing quickly, it might get stuck modulo some N, similar to the quadratic example. So, maybe we can use modular arithmetic to show that for some N, the sequence never reaches 0 mod N, unless P(x) is linear. But the problem states that for every N, the sequence does reach 0 mod N. Therefore, if P(x) is not linear, there must be some N where the sequence gets stuck. But how to formalize this?Alternatively, let&#39;s think about the properties of P(x). Since P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n, the polynomial must tend to infinity as n increases. But the key is the recursive sequence x_n must cover all moduli. Let&#39;s think about the behavior modulo N for arbitrary N. Suppose we fix some N and look at the sequence modulo N. The sequence is x₁, x₂, ..., where each term is obtained by applying P modulo N. So, starting from x₁ = 1 mod N, then x₂ = P(1) mod N, x₃ = P(P(1)) mod N, etc. Since the sequence must eventually reach 0 mod N, there exists some k such that x_k ≡ 0 mod N. Therefore, the function P modulo N must eventually map some element to 0 mod N. But since the sequence starts at 1 and iterates P, we need that the orbit of 1 under P modulo N eventually reaches 0. For this to hold for all N, the dynamics of P modulo N must be such that 0 is in the forward orbit of 1. Now, suppose that P(x) = x + 1. Then the sequence modulo N is 1, 2, 3, ..., N-1, 0, 1, 2, etc. So, it cycles through all residues modulo N, and indeed, it reaches 0 mod N at the Nth term. Hence, for P(x) = x + 1, the sequence does contain a term divisible by every N. So, this works. But for other polynomials, like P(x) = x + c with c ≠ 1, as we saw earlier, the sequence doesn&#39;t reach 0 modulo c. So, they fail. For higher-degree polynomials, like P(x) = x^2 + 1, we saw that modulo 3, the sequence gets stuck at 2 mod 3. So, how can we generalize this?Perhaps we can consider the behavior modulo primes. Suppose that P(x) is not x + 1. Then, we need to find a prime p such that the sequence x_n modulo p never hits 0. If we can find such a prime, then the condition of the problem is violated, hence P(x) must be x + 1. So, maybe considering primes and using properties of polynomials modulo primes.Let’s suppose that P(x) has degree at least 2. Then, for sufficiently large primes p, the polynomial P(x) modulo p is a non-linear function. The dynamics of such functions can have cycles or fixed points. If the sequence x_n modulo p enters a cycle that does not contain 0, then 0 will never be reached. Therefore, if for some prime p, the forward orbit of 1 under P modulo p does not contain 0, then such a prime p would contradict the problem&#39;s condition. Hence, we need to show that for any polynomial P(x) ≠ x + 1, there exists such a prime p.Alternatively, consider the case when P(x) = x + c with c &gt; 1. As we saw earlier, modulo c, the sequence is 1, 1 + c, 1 + 2c, etc., which is 1 mod c. So, 0 mod c is never achieved, hence c divides no term. Therefore, such a linear polynomial with c &gt; 1 fails. So, only c = 1 works. For non-linear polynomials, similar arguments may apply. For example, take P(x) = x + k, then similar to the c case. But if P is non-linear, maybe we can find primes where P has no roots, or where the iteration doesn&#39;t reach 0.Another approach: suppose that P(x) is not x + 1. Then either P is linear with c &gt; 1, which we already saw fails, or P is non-linear. Let&#39;s handle the linear case first. If P is linear, then P(x) = ax + b, with a &gt; 1 (since if a = 1, then P(x) = x + b, which for b = 1 works, but b &gt; 1 fails as shown earlier). But wait, the problem states P(n) &gt; n for all n. So, if P is linear, P(n) = a*n + b. Then, to have P(n) &gt; n for all n ≥ 1, we need (a - 1)*n + b &gt; 0. Since n can be any positive integer, for this to hold for all n, we must have a - 1 ≥ 1, so a ≥ 2. If a = 1, then we need b &gt; 0, but as we saw, only b = 1 works. If a ≥ 2, then P(n) = a*n + b. Let&#39;s see what the sequence x_n would look like. Starting with x₁ = 1, x₂ = a*1 + b, x₃ = a*(a + b) + b = a² + a*b + b, x₄ = a*(a² + a*b + b) + b = a³ + a²*b + a*b + b, etc. So, each term is a geometric progression-like sequence with ratio a. So, x_n = a^{n-1} + b*(a^{n-2} + a^{n-3} + ... + 1) = a^{n-1} + b*( (a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1) ). Therefore, x_n = (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) + (b - 1)*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, maybe a better way: x_n = a^{n-1} + b*(a^{n-2} + a^{n-3} + ... + 1). So, for example, if a = 2 and b = 1, then x_n = 2^{n-1} + (2^{n-2} + ... + 1) = 2^{n-1} + (2^{n-1} - 1) = 2^{n} - 1. Then, the sequence is 1, 3, 7, 15, ..., which is 2^n - 1. Now, does this sequence have the property that every N divides some term? Let&#39;s check for N = 4. The terms are 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... modulo 4: 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. So, modulo 4, after the first term, it&#39;s stuck at 3 mod 4. So, 4 does not divide any term. Therefore, even though P(n) = 2n + 1 satisfies P(n) &gt; n for all n, the sequence does not satisfy the divisibility condition. Hence, linear polynomials with a ≥ 2 do not work. So, only a = 1 and b = 1 works for linear polynomials.So, linear case is settled: only P(x) = x + 1 works. Now, what about non-linear polynomials? Suppose P(x) is quadratic, cubic, etc. Let&#39;s consider a quadratic example. Suppose P(x) = x^2 - x + 1. Then, P(n) = n^2 - n + 1. Let&#39;s check if P(n) &gt; n for all n. For n ≥ 1, n^2 - n + 1 = n(n - 1) + 1. For n = 1: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 &gt; 1? No, equals 1. So, P(1) = 1, which is not greater than 1. So, that&#39;s invalid. So, need to choose a polynomial where P(n) &gt; n for all n. Let&#39;s try P(x) = x^2 + 1. Then, P(n) = n^2 + 1 &gt; n for all n ≥ 1. Yes, because n^2 + 1 - n = n(n - 1) + 1 ≥ 1 for n ≥ 1. So, that&#39;s valid. Now, the sequence starts at 1, x₂ = 1^2 + 1 = 2, x₃ = 2^2 + 1 = 5, x₄ = 5^2 + 1 = 26, x₅ = 26^2 + 1 = 677, etc. Now, check if every N divides some term. Let&#39;s check N = 3. The sequence modulo 3: x₁ = 1 mod 3, x₂ = 2 mod 3, x₃ = 5 mod 3 = 2, x₄ = 26 mod 3 = 2, x₅ = 677 mod 3. 677 divided by 3 is 225*3 + 2, so 2 mod 3. So, all terms after x₂ are 2 mod 3. So, 3 never divides any term in the sequence. Hence, P(x) = x^2 + 1 fails. So, that&#39;s another example.So, how can we generalize this? For a polynomial P(x) of degree ≥ 2, maybe we can find a prime p such that the iteration of P modulo p starting at 1 never reaches 0. To do this, perhaps use the concept of fixed points or cycles in the function P modulo p. If P modulo p maps some residues to others in a way that 0 is not in the forward orbit of 1, then we have a contradiction. Therefore, if we can find such a prime p for any non-linear P(x), then we can conclude that P(x) must be linear. Since we already know that for linear polynomials only P(x) = x + 1 works, that would complete the proof.So, let&#39;s try to formalize this. Suppose that P(x) is a polynomial of degree d ≥ 2 with integer coefficients, and P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n. Then, there exists a prime p such that the sequence x₁ = 1, x₂ = P(1), ..., modulo p never reaches 0. Alternatively, perhaps use the concept of periodicity. If the function P modulo p has the property that iterating it starting from 1 leads to a cycle that does not include 0, then 0 is never reached. For example, in the quadratic case above modulo 3, the sequence enters the fixed point 2 mod 3. So, once it reaches 2, it stays there. Hence, 0 is never achieved.So, to find such a prime p, perhaps consider primes where P has a fixed point that is not 0, and such that starting from 1, the iteration leads to that fixed point. Alternatively, use the fact that for a polynomial of degree ≥ 2, the iterates modulo p can enter cycles, and if 0 is not in the cycle, then 0 is never reached.But how to ensure that such a prime exists for any P(x) ≠ x + 1?This seems related to the concept of dynamical systems modulo primes. Maybe applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem or Dirichlet&#39;s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. Alternatively, using the infinitude of primes in certain arithmetic progressions to construct such a prime p.Alternatively, consider that if P(x) is not x + 1, then either it&#39;s linear with a &gt; 1 or non-linear. For linear with a &gt; 1, we saw that modulo a, the sequence is stuck at 1 mod a, so p = a would be a prime (if a is prime) that does not divide any term. However, a might not be prime. But since P(x) = a x + b, if a ≥ 2, then let&#39;s take a prime divisor p of a. Then, modulo p, the sequence x_n is x_{n} = a x_{n-1} + b mod p. Since p divides a, this reduces to x_n ≡ b mod p. Starting from x₁ = 1 mod p, x₂ = b mod p, x₃ = b mod p, etc. So, unless b ≡ 0 mod p, the sequence gets stuck at b mod p. But if b ≡ 0 mod p, then x₂ ≡ 0 mod p. Wait, let&#39;s see. If a is divisible by p, then x₂ = a x₁ + b ≡ 0 + b ≡ b mod p. If b ≡ 0 mod p, then x₂ ≡ 0 mod p. So, if p divides a and p divides b, then x₂ ≡ 0 mod p. Otherwise, if p divides a but not b, then x₂ ≡ b mod p, and subsequent terms stay at b mod p, never reaching 0. So, if there exists a prime p dividing a but not dividing b, then modulo p, the sequence becomes 1, b, b, b,... So, unless b ≡ 0 mod p, it never reaches 0. Hence, if a and b are not coprime, say they share a common prime factor p, then if p divides a and b, then x₂ ≡ 0 mod p. But if there exists a prime p dividing a but not b, then the sequence gets stuck at b mod p. Therefore, if the polynomial is linear, P(x) = a x + b, with a ≥ 2, then unless a and b are such that all prime divisors of a also divide b, the sequence gets stuck modulo such a prime. However, if all prime divisors of a divide b, then let’s say a is a power of some prime p. Then, a = p^k, and p divides b. Then, x₂ = p^k * 1 + b ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod p. So, in that case, x₂ is divisible by p. But for another prime q not dividing a or b, then the sequence modulo q would be x₁ = 1, x₂ = a*1 + b mod q, x₃ = a*(a + b) + b mod q = a² + a b + b mod q, etc. Whether this sequence reaches 0 mod q depends on the dynamics. But since a ≥ 2, perhaps similar to the previous case, if q is a prime not dividing a or b, then the sequence is x_{n} = a^{n-1} + b*(a^{n-2} + ... + 1) mod q. If a ≡ 1 mod q, then this is 1 + b*(n - 1) mod q, which could reach 0 mod q. If a ≡ 1 mod q, then x_n ≡ 1 + b*(n - 1) mod q. So, to have 1 + b*(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod q, we need n ≡ ( -1 ) * b^{-1} + 1 mod q. So, n exists. However, if a ≡ c ≠ 1 mod q, then x_n = a^{n-1} + b*( (a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1) ) mod q. Then, solving x_n ≡ 0 mod q would require a^{n} ≡ 1 - b/(a - 1) mod q. Not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe for linear polynomials, the only way the sequence can reach 0 modulo all primes is if a = 1 and b = 1. Because if a = 1, then the sequence is x_n = 1 + (n - 1)*b. So, to have x_n ≡ 0 mod N, we need 1 + (n - 1)*b ≡ 0 mod N. If b and N are coprime, then n ≡ (-1)*b^{-1} + 1 mod N. So, such an n exists. If b and N are not coprime, then the equation 1 + (n - 1)*b ≡ 0 mod N has a solution only if gcd(b, N) divides 1, i.e., gcd(b, N) = 1. Wait, no. The equation is (n - 1)*b ≡ -1 mod N. For this equation to have a solution, we need that gcd(b, N) divides -1 mod N. Which is equivalent to gcd(b, N) divides 1. Hence, gcd(b, N) = 1. Therefore, if b and N are coprime, then there is a solution. If not, then no solution exists. Therefore, in order for the sequence to reach 0 mod N for all N, we must have that for every N, gcd(b, N) = 1, which is only possible if b = 1 or -1. But since P(n) &gt; n for all n, and if b = -1, then P(n) = n - 1, which is not greater than n. Therefore, b must be 1. Therefore, the only linear polynomial that works is P(x) = x + 1. Hence, the linear case is settled.Now, moving on to non-linear polynomials. Let&#39;s suppose that P(x) is a non-linear polynomial with integer coefficients, degree ≥ 2, and P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n. We need to show that there exists some positive integer N such that no term in the sequence x₁, x₂, ... is divisible by N. If we can show that, then it would follow that P(x) must be linear, hence x + 1. To do this, perhaps consider primes p where P has a fixed point that is not 0 mod p. Then, starting from 1 mod p, if the iteration leads to that fixed point, then 0 mod p is never reached. So, we need to find such a prime p. Alternatively, use the fact that for a non-linear polynomial, the set of primes p for which P(x) mod p has a root is either finite or has density 0 (by Chebotarev&#39;s theorem?). Wait, but we need something slightly different. We need that for some prime p, the orbit of 1 under P modulo p does not contain 0. Alternatively, use the concept of iterated preimages. If 0 is not in the forward orbit of 1 modulo p, then p is a prime we are looking for. Alternatively, use the following strategy: since P is a non-linear polynomial, then for all sufficiently large primes p, the function P modulo p is a non-linear function. Therefore, the image of P modulo p is at most deg(P) residues. If we can show that for some prime p, the image does not contain 0, then starting from 1, the sequence x_n modulo p would cycle among residues in the image, never reaching 0. However, this might not directly work because even if 0 is in the image, the iteration starting at 1 might not reach 0.Alternatively, use the fact that for a non-linear polynomial, the equation P(x) ≡ 0 mod p has solutions for only finitely many primes p, unless P(x) is linear. Wait, no, that&#39;s not true. For example, P(x) = x^2 + 1 has roots modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4 or p = 2. So, there are infinitely many primes where P(x) has roots. So, this approach might not work.Alternatively, consider that for a non-linear polynomial, the iterations modulo p might not be surjective. For example, if P is a quadratic polynomial, then P modulo p is a function from Z/pZ to itself. The image of P modulo p is at least (p + 1)/2, but not necessarily the entire set. However, even if the image is large, the iterations starting from 1 might not cover all residues. So, perhaps, for some prime p, the orbit of 1 under P modulo p does not include 0. To formalize this, maybe use the pigeonhole principle. For each prime p, the sequence x₁, x₂, ... modulo p must eventually become periodic since there are only finitely many residues. If 0 is not in the periodic part, then 0 is never reached. So, for the sequence to reach 0 mod p, the periodic part must include 0. Otherwise, if the sequence enters a cycle that doesn&#39;t contain 0, then 0 is never reached. Therefore, if we can find a prime p where the orbit of 1 under P modulo p does not contain 0, then we have our N = p. To do this, perhaps consider the following: For polynomials of degree ≥ 2, the iterations can be forced into cycles that avoid 0 modulo some prime p. Alternatively, use the concept of resultant or discriminant. For example, consider the equations P(x) ≡ x mod p, which are fixed points. If there exists a fixed point other than 0, then the iteration might get stuck there. Alternatively, use the fact that if P(x) - x has a root mod p, then there is a fixed point. If the iteration starting at 1 converges to such a fixed point, and that fixed point is not 0, then 0 is never reached.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the case where P(x) is of the form x + 1 + Q(x), where Q(x) is a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. But this might not be helpful.Alternatively, use induction. Suppose that for some prime p, P(x) ≡ c mod p for some constant c, when x ≡ d mod p. Then, starting from 1 mod p, the sequence would go to c mod p, then P(c) mod p, etc. If c is a fixed point, then it stays there. So, if we can find a prime p where P has a fixed point not equal to 0 mod p, and such that starting from 1 mod p, the iteration reaches that fixed point. Then, 0 mod p is never reached.Alternatively, suppose that there exists a prime p such that P(0) ≡ k mod p, and k ≠ 0. Then, if the iteration starting from 1 never reaches 0, then we are done. But I need to think of a better way.Wait, here&#39;s an idea. Suppose that P is a polynomial of degree ≥ 2. Then, the derivative P’(x) is non-constant. By the Sato–Tate conjecture or other deep results, maybe the values of P(x) mod p cover all residues for infinitely many primes p, but I&#39;m not sure. Alternatively, use the fact that for a non-linear polynomial, the set of primes p for which P(x) mod p is a permutation polynomial modulo p is very small. If P is not a permutation polynomial modulo p, then there exist residues that are not in the image of P. So, if 0 is not in the image of P modulo p, then certainly the sequence cannot reach 0. However, 0 might be in the image, but the iterations starting at 1 might not reach it.Alternatively, consider the following. For a polynomial P of degree ≥ 2, there are infinitely many primes p such that P is not surjective modulo p. In particular, there exists a prime p such that 0 is not in the image of P modulo p. Then, since x_{n} = P(x_{n-1}) modulo p, if 0 is not in the image of P modulo p, then x_{n} can never be 0 mod p. Therefore, such primes p would violate the problem&#39;s condition. However, this requires that such primes exist. Is it true that for any non-linear polynomial P with integer coefficients, there are infinitely many primes p such that 0 is not in the image of P modulo p?Alternatively, for a non-linear polynomial P(x), consider the equation P(x) ≡ 0 mod p. For primes p where this equation has no solution, then the sequence can never reach 0 mod p. If there are infinitely many such primes, then we can take p as such a prime, and hence the sequence does not contain a term divisible by p, contradicting the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, if for a non-linear polynomial P(x), there are infinitely many primes p where P(x) ≡ 0 mod p has no solution, then such a polynomial cannot satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Hence, only polynomials for which P(x) ≡ 0 mod p has a solution for all primes p can satisfy the problem&#39;s condition.However, by the Chebotarev density theorem, if P(x) is irreducible over Q, then the set of primes p for which P(x) splits into linear factors modulo p has density 1/deg(P)! or something like that. But this might not directly apply. Alternatively, use the fact that if P(x) is not linear, then the equation P(x) ≡ 0 mod p has a solution for only density 0 primes p. Wait, actually, for example, take P(x) = x^2 + 1. Then, the primes p where x^2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p has a solution are primes p ≡ 1 mod 4 and p = 2. By Dirichlet&#39;s theorem, there are infinitely many such primes. Similarly, primes where there is no solution are primes p ≡ 3 mod 4, which are also infinite. Hence, for such P(x), there are infinitely many primes where 0 is not in the image. Therefore, the sequence starting at 1 modulo p would never reach 0, hence such primes p would violate the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, such a polynomial P(x) = x^2 + 1 cannot satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Hence, only polynomials P(x) for which P(x) ≡ 0 mod p has a solution for all primes p can satisfy the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, such a polynomial must have roots modulo all primes p. Which, by the Hasse-Weil theorem and other results, suggests that the polynomial must split into linear factors over Q, i.e., P(x) must be linear. Because if a polynomial has roots modulo all primes p, then it must have a rational root, by the Chevalley-Warning theorem? Wait, not exactly. The fact that a polynomial has roots modulo all primes does not necessarily imply it has a rational root. For example, x^2 + 1 has roots modulo all primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, but not for p ≡ 3 mod 4. Wait, no, but in our case, if the polynomial P(x) must have roots modulo all primes p, then P(x) must have a root modulo every prime p, which is a stronger condition. A result by Niven, Evans, and others states that if a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients has a root modulo every prime p, then f(x) has a rational root. Therefore, if P(x) has a root modulo every prime p, then there exists an integer a such that P(a) ≡ 0 mod p for all primes p. Hence, P(a) = 0, because if P(a) ≠ 0, then take p dividing P(a) to get a contradiction. Therefore, P(a) = 0, so x - a divides P(x). Therefore, P(x) = (x - a)Q(x) for some polynomial Q(x) with integer coefficients.But wait, in our problem, P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n. If P(x) = (x - a)Q(x), then for x &gt; a, P(x) could be positive or negative depending on Q(x). However, since P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n, then (n - a)Q(n) &gt; n. If a is a non-positive integer, then n - a ≥ n + 1 for all positive integers n. So, Q(n) must be positive for all n, and (n - a)Q(n) &gt; n. If a is a positive integer, then for n = a, P(a) = 0, which contradicts P(n) &gt; n for all positive integers n. Therefore, a must be a non-positive integer.However, if a is a non-positive integer, say a ≤ 0, then for all positive integers n ≥ 1, n - a ≥ n + |a|, so P(n) = (n - a)Q(n) ≥ (n + |a|)Q(n). Since Q(n) is an integer polynomial, to have P(n) &gt; n, we must have Q(n) ≥ 1 for all n ≥ 1, and (n - a)Q(n) &gt; n. However, even with Q(n) = 1, we have (n - a) ≥ n + |a| &gt; n, which is true. For example, if a = 0, then P(n) = n * Q(n). To have P(n) &gt; n, Q(n) must be at least 2 for all n ≥ 1. But then, for n = 1, P(1) = 1 * Q(1) ≥ 2 &gt; 1. Then, the sequence x₁ = 1, x₂ = P(1) ≥ 2, x₃ = P(x₂) ≥ 2 * 2 = 4, etc., growing exponentially. However, modulo primes not dividing any term, the sequence might not reach 0. For example, take P(x) = 2x. Then, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., which is 2^{n-1}. Then, modulo 3, it&#39;s 1, 2, 1, 2, ... cycling, never reaching 0. Hence, such a polynomial P(x) = 2x fails. But in this case, P(x) = 2x does not have a root at all, so it&#39;s not of the form (x - a)Q(x). Wait, but earlier we thought that if a polynomial has roots modulo all primes, then it must have a rational root. So, P(x) = 2x doesn&#39;t have a rational root, hence there exist primes where 2x ≡ 0 mod p requires x ≡ 0 mod p, but starting from x₁ = 1, the sequence never reaches 0 mod p. Hence, P(x) = 2x fails, as expected.Wait, maybe my previous line of thought isn&#39;t applicable here. The problem states that the sequence must have a term divisible by every N. For P(x) = 2x, the sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., so all terms are powers of 2. Hence, only N that are powers of 2 divide some term. Therefore, N = 3, for example, does not divide any term. Hence, P(x) = 2x fails. So, even though P(x) = 2x is of the form (x - 0)*2, which has a root at 0, but the sequence never reaches 0 except if starting from 0, which it doesn&#39;t. Hence, having a root at 0 doesn&#39;t help unless the sequence reaches 0. But starting from 1, the sequence never reaches 0.Therefore, even if P(x) has a root, unless the iteration starting from 1 reaches that root modulo p for every prime p, the condition is not satisfied. Hence, perhaps the only way this can happen is if the polynomial is x + 1, such that the sequence increments by 1 each time, thus covering all residues modulo every N.Alternatively, another angle: since the sequence x_n must be such that for every N, there&#39;s some k with x_k ≡ 0 mod N. This implies that the sequence x_n is cofinal in the inverse limit of Z/NZ, hence it&#39;s a generator of the inverse limit, which is the profinite completion of Z. But the only polynomial that generates the profinite completion in this way is the successor function x + 1. I&#39;m not sure if this is precise, but it&#39;s a vague idea.Alternatively, think about the sequence x_n for P(x) = x + 1: it&#39;s just 1, 2, 3, ..., so obviously every N is eventually included. For any other polynomial, the sequence either grows too fast (like exponential) skipping residues or gets stuck modulo some primes. Another approach: use mathematical induction. Suppose that for all N up to some M, the minimal k such that x_k ≡ 0 mod N is bounded. Then, for N = M + 1, need to show that there&#39;s a term divisible by M + 1. But I don&#39;t see how this would help.Wait, consider that for P(x) = x + 1, the sequence is the natural numbers, so every N divides the Nth term. For any other polynomial, the sequence grows faster. For example, linear polynomial with a &gt; 1, like P(x) = 2x + 1, the sequence is 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ..., which are Mersenne numbers. These numbers are of the form 2^n - 1. So, N = 2 divides 3 - 1 = 2, but N = 4, does 4 divide any term? 3 mod 4 = 3, 7 mod 4 = 3, 15 mod 4 = 3, etc. So, no term is divisible by 4. Hence, fails. Similarly, quadratic polynomials also fail. So, the only way for the sequence to cover all moduli is to have the sequence be all natural numbers, which only happens if P(x) = x + 1.Therefore, the key idea is that any polynomial other than x + 1 either grows too quickly, skipping over residues, or gets stuck in a fixed cycle modulo some prime, preventing it from reaching 0 mod p. Hence, the only polynomial that can satisfy the condition is P(x) = x + 1.Putting it all together:1. Show that if P is linear and not x + 1, then there exists a prime p where the sequence x_n modulo p never reaches 0.2. Show that if P is non-linear, then there exists a prime p where the sequence x_n modulo p never reaches 0.Therefore, in either case, if P(x) ≠ x + 1, the condition is violated, hence P(x) must be x + 1.Final Answerboxed{P(x) = x + 1}&lt;/think&gt;Given a polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients such that ( P(n) &gt; n ) for every positive integer ( n ), and the sequence ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_{n} = P(x_{n-1}) ) has the property that for every positive integer ( N ), there exists a term in the sequence divisible by ( N ), we need to prove that ( P(x) = x + 1 ).1. Linear Polynomials:   - If ( P(x) ) is a linear polynomial, it can be written as ( P(x) = ax + b ) with ( a geq 1 ).   - For ( P(n) &gt; n ) to hold for all ( n ), ( a geq 2 ) or ( a = 1 ) with ( b = 1 ).   - If ( a geq 2 ), the sequence ( x_n ) grows exponentially, but modulo some prime ( p ), the sequence gets stuck and never reaches 0, contradicting the divisibility condition.   - Only ( P(x) = x + 1 ) results in the sequence ( 1, 2, 3, ldots ), which covers all residues modulo ( N ).2. Non-linear Polynomials:   - For polynomials of degree ( geq 2 ), the sequence ( x_n ) grows very quickly.   - Modulo some prime ( p ), the sequence can enter a cycle that does not include 0, violating the divisibility condition.   - Example: ( P(x) = x^2 + 1 ) modulo 3 results in the sequence ( 1, 2, 2, 2, ldots ), never reaching 0.3. General Argument:   - For any polynomial ( P(x) neq x + 1 ), there exists a prime ( p ) such that the sequence ( x_n ) modulo ( p ) does not reach 0.   - This is due to the polynomial either growing too quickly or entering a fixed cycle modulo ( p ).Thus, the only polynomial ( P(x) ) that ensures the sequence covers all residues modulo every ( N ) is ( P(x) = x + 1 ).[boxed{P(x) = x + 1}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem states:Given a polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients, such that for every positive integer ( n ), we have ( P(n) &gt; n ). Then there&#39;s a sequence defined recursively by ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = P(x_1) ), and so on, with each subsequent term being ( x_n = P(x_{n-1}) ). The condition given is that for every positive integer ( N ), there exists a member of the sequence divisible by ( N ). We need to prove that the only such polynomial ( P(x) ) is ( x + 1 ).Alright, so first, let&#39;s parse the problem. The key points here are:1. ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.2. For every positive integer ( n ), ( P(n) &gt; n ).3. The sequence ( x_n ) starts at 1 and each subsequent term is the polynomial evaluated at the previous term.4. The sequence has the property that for every positive integer ( N ), some term in the sequence is divisible by ( N ).5. We must show that under these conditions, ( P(x) ) must be ( x + 1 ).So, the goal is to show that the only polynomial meeting these criteria is ( x + 1 ). Let&#39;s think about how to approach this.First, since ( P(x) ) has integer coefficients, for any integer input, the output is also an integer. The condition ( P(n) &gt; n ) for all positive integers ( n ) tells us that the polynomial is strictly increasing on the positive integers, right? Because each term of the sequence is generated by applying ( P ) to the previous term, starting from 1. If ( P(n) &gt; n ), then the sequence ( x_n ) is strictly increasing: ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = P(1) &gt; 1 ), ( x_3 = P(x_2) &gt; x_2 ), etc.Now, the critical condition is that for every positive integer ( N ), there exists some term ( x_k ) in the sequence such that ( N ) divides ( x_k ). This means that the sequence ( x_n ) is &quot;divisible by every positive integer,&quot; which is a very strong condition. In other words, the sequence must hit every possible residue class modulo every ( N ), or at least hit 0 modulo every ( N ).We need to show that only ( P(x) = x + 1 ) satisfies all these conditions. So, maybe we can start by assuming that ( P(x) ) is a linear polynomial and see if that works, and then show that higher-degree polynomials can&#39;t satisfy the divisibility condition.Wait, but the problem doesn&#39;t state that ( P(x) ) is linear. So, we need to consider polynomials of any degree. However, the conclusion is that ( P(x) = x + 1 ), which is linear. So perhaps higher-degree polynomials can&#39;t satisfy the divisibility condition because they grow too quickly, making it impossible for the sequence to hit every modulus.Let me test this idea. If ( P(x) ) is, say, quadratic, like ( P(x) = x^2 + 1 ), then the sequence would be 1, 2, 5, 26, etc., which grows very rapidly. In such a case, it&#39;s unlikely that the sequence would contain numbers divisible by every ( N ). For example, does 3 divide any term in this sequence? Let&#39;s check:x1 = 1 (not divisible by 3)x2 = 2 (not divisible by 3)x3 = 5 (5 mod 3 = 2)x4 = 26 (26 mod 3 = 2)x5 = 26^2 +1 = 677 (677 mod 3: 6+7+7=20, 20 mod 3=2, so 677 mod 3=2)Wait, so all subsequent terms are congruent to 2 mod 3. Therefore, none of the terms after x2 are divisible by 3, and x2 is 2, which is not divisible by 3. So this sequence never hits a multiple of 3. Hence, ( P(x) = x^2 + 1 ) doesn&#39;t satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, quadratic polynomials might not work.Similarly, for higher-degree polynomials, the sequence would grow even faster, likely missing many moduli.On the other hand, for ( P(x) = x + 1 ), the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., which is just the sequence of natural numbers. Obviously, every positive integer ( N ) is in the sequence, so every ( N ) divides some term (specifically, the ( N )-th term). So this works.But the problem states that we need to prove that ( P(x) = x + 1 ) is the only such polynomial. So we need to show that no other polynomial besides ( x + 1 ) can have the property that starting from 1 and iterating ( P ), the sequence contains a multiple of every ( N ).So, how to approach this? Let&#39;s suppose ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, ( P(n) &gt; n ) for all positive integers ( n ), and the sequence ( x_n ) defined by ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_{k+1} = P(x_k) ) is such that for every ( N ), there exists ( k ) with ( N ) divides ( x_k ). Then, we must show ( P(x) = x + 1 ).Perhaps we can proceed by induction or by analyzing the properties of the polynomial.First, note that if ( P(x) = x + c ), where ( c ) is a positive integer constant, then the sequence ( x_n ) would be 1, 1 + c, 1 + 2c, 1 + 3c, etc. But unless ( c = 1 ), this sequence would be an arithmetic progression with difference ( c ). For example, if ( c = 2 ), the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., which are all odd numbers. Therefore, even numbers would never appear in the sequence, so the divisibility condition would fail for ( N = 2 ). Therefore, only ( c = 1 ) gives the sequence of all natural numbers, which does satisfy the divisibility condition.So, this suggests that linear polynomials ( P(x) = x + c ) with ( c &gt; 1 ) don&#39;t work. Similarly, if ( c = 1 ), it works. So, linear polynomials other than ( x + 1 ) don&#39;t work.But we need to consider polynomials of higher degrees. Let&#39;s see.Suppose ( P(x) ) is a linear polynomial. Then it must be of the form ( P(x) = ax + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers. Since ( P(n) &gt; n ) for all positive integers ( n ), we must have ( a geq 1 ). If ( a = 1 ), then ( P(x) = x + b ), and for ( P(n) &gt; n ), we need ( b geq 1 ). But as we saw, only ( b = 1 ) works. If ( a geq 2 ), then ( P(x) = ax + b ). Let&#39;s see what the sequence looks like.Suppose ( a = 2 ), ( b = 1 ). Then the sequence is 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... Each term is ( 2 times text{previous} + 1 ). These numbers are one less than powers of 2: 2^1 -1=1, 2^2 -1=3, 2^3 -1=7, etc. So the sequence is 2^n -1. Now, in this case, does this sequence contain a multiple of every N? For example, take N=4. The terms are 1,3,7,15,31,63,... Let&#39;s see: 7 mod 4 = 3, 15 mod 4 = 3, 31 mod 4 = 3, etc. So after the first term, all terms are congruent to 3 mod 4. Therefore, 4 never divides any term after the first, and the first term is 1. So 4 doesn&#39;t divide any term in the sequence. Therefore, such a polynomial doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition.So, this suggests that even linear polynomials with ( a geq 2 ) don&#39;t work. So only ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ) works for linear polynomials.Now, the problem allows for polynomials of any degree. So, maybe we can use induction on the degree of the polynomial to show that only degree 1 polynomials can work, and specifically only ( x + 1 ).Alternatively, perhaps we can use modular arithmetic properties. For instance, if the sequence is to hit every modulus N, then for each N, the sequence must eventually reach 0 modulo N. But if the polynomial P has degree higher than 1, the sequence modulo N might enter a cycle without hitting 0. Let&#39;s consider an example.Take N=3 and suppose P(x) = x^2 + 1. The sequence starts at 1. Then mod 3:x1 = 1 mod 3x2 = 1^2 +1 = 2 mod 3x3 = 2^2 +1 = 5 mod 3 = 2 mod 3x4 = 2^2 +1 = 5 mod 3 = 2 mod 3, etc. So once it hits 2 mod 3, it stays there. Therefore, 0 mod 3 is never reached. Therefore, 3 doesn&#39;t divide any term of the sequence, so P(x) = x^2 +1 doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition.Similarly, if we have a higher-degree polynomial, maybe the sequence modulo N gets stuck in a loop that doesn&#39;t include 0. Therefore, to satisfy the condition that for every N, 0 mod N is eventually reached, the polynomial must have a certain structure.Another approach: Suppose that P(x) is of degree at least 2. Then, the sequence x_n grows exponentially or faster. For example, quadratic polynomials would lead to roughly doubly exponential growth (each term is the square of the previous term plus something). In such a case, the gaps between consecutive terms become enormous, so it&#39;s unlikely that all numbers N will divide some term. For instance, if the sequence grows too quickly, there will be many N for which all terms are either less than N (but after some point, all terms exceed N) or the terms skip over N&#39;s multiples.But how can we formalize this intuition?Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the properties required for the sequence to cover all moduli. For every N, the sequence must reach 0 mod N. This is equivalent to saying that the sequence is &quot;syndetic&quot; or &quot;co-finite&quot; in some sense modulo every N. But actually, the condition is stronger: for each N, there&#39;s some k such that x_k ≡ 0 mod N.If we can show that the only polynomial for which the iterated sequence x_n is such that for all N, x_k ≡ 0 mod N for some k, is P(x) = x +1, then we are done.Alternatively, suppose that P(x) is not x +1. Then, we need to find some N for which no x_k is divisible by N.So, assuming that P(x) ≠ x +1, then we need to find such an N. How?Perhaps, for example, if P(x) is linear, as we saw earlier, only P(x) = x +1 works, because other linear polynomials lead to arithmetic sequences which miss some moduli.For non-linear polynomials, maybe we can use the fact that they grow too quickly, but we need to find a specific N where divisibility fails.Alternatively, maybe we can analyze the behavior modulo primes. For example, if P(x) is not x +1, then there exists a prime p such that the sequence x_n modulo p does not cover all residues or does not reach 0. Let&#39;s think about primes.Suppose p is a prime. If the sequence x_n modulo p is to reach 0, then starting from 1, applying P iteratively must eventually reach 0. If P is a permutation polynomial modulo p, or if the iterations cycle through residues without hitting 0, then 0 is never achieved.But permutation polynomials modulo p are bijections, but even so, unless 0 is in the cycle, it won&#39;t be reached. However, if the polynomial is such that P(0) ≡ 0 mod p, then starting from 1, we might never reach 0. Wait, but if the polynomial is such that P(0) ≡ c mod p, then unless c ≡0 mod p, starting from 1, you might not reach 0.Wait, but in our case, since the sequence starts at 1, unless the polynomial allows some path from 1 to 0 modulo p, we won&#39;t get 0. So, if for some prime p, the orbit of 1 under P modulo p does not contain 0, then p doesn&#39;t divide any term of the sequence.Therefore, our strategy could be: For any polynomial P(x) ≠ x +1, find a prime p such that the orbit of 1 under P modulo p never reaches 0.But how?Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of periodicity modulo primes.Suppose that P(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then, for each prime p, the sequence x_n modulo p is determined by iterating the function P modulo p. Since there are finitely many residues modulo p, the sequence must eventually become periodic modulo p.If 0 is not in the periodic part, then 0 never occurs in the sequence modulo p. Therefore, to have 0 in the sequence modulo p, 0 must be in the forward orbit of 1 under P modulo p.Therefore, if we can show that for some prime p, 0 is not in the forward orbit of 1 under P modulo p, then that prime p does not divide any term of the sequence, contradicting the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, such a prime p cannot exist if the problem&#39;s condition holds, which would force P(x) to be x +1.Therefore, our goal is to show that if P(x) ≠ x +1, then there exists a prime p such that starting from 1 and iterating P modulo p never reaches 0.So, let&#39;s suppose that P(x) is not equal to x +1. Then, we need to construct or find such a prime p.Alternatively, perhaps look at primes where P has a fixed point. Let me think.Suppose that for some prime p, P(a) ≡ a mod p for some a. Then, if the sequence x_n modulo p ever reaches a, it will stay there. So, if 1 is not congruent to a, and the sequence can reach a, then it gets stuck at a, never reaching 0.Alternatively, if the polynomial P modulo p has a fixed point other than 0, and the sequence can reach that fixed point, then 0 is never reached.But how does that help?Alternatively, consider the case when P(x) = x + c with c &gt;1. As we saw, for N = c+1, the sequence would be 1, 1 + c, 1 + 2c, etc., which are all congruent to 1 mod c. Hence, if we take N = c, then the terms are 1, c +1, 2c +1, etc., which are all congruent to 1 mod c, so they never reach 0 mod c. Therefore, such a polynomial would not satisfy the divisibility condition for N = c. Hence, only c =1 works.Similarly, for non-linear polynomials, perhaps there exists a prime p such that the sequence modulo p gets trapped in a cycle that does not include 0.To formalize this, we can use the concept of fixed points and cycles in the iteration of polynomial functions modulo primes.Suppose that P(x) is a polynomial of degree at least 2. Then, for primes p where P is a permutation polynomial, maybe 0 is in the orbit, but permutation polynomials modulo p are rare. For example, linear polynomials (ax + b) are permutations iff a ≠0 mod p, but higher-degree polynomials can also be permutation polynomials, but their characterization is more complex.Alternatively, for a general polynomial, the mapping modulo p may not be surjective, so 0 might not be in the image. However, since we start at 1 and iterate P, even if 0 is in the image, it might not be reachable from 1.Alternatively, consider primes p where the constant term of P(x) is congruent to 1 mod p. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let&#39;s take a prime p that divides P(0) -1. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, let&#39;s use the following approach:Assume that P(x) is not x +1. Then, there are two cases: either P(x) is linear (degree 1) but not x +1, or P(x) has degree ≥2.In the linear case, as we saw, only x +1 works. So if P(x) is linear and not x +1, then the sequence is an arithmetic progression with difference c &gt;1, which does not cover all residues, so there exists N (for example, c +1) such that no term is divisible by N.In the nonlinear case, P(x) has degree ≥2. We need to show that there exists some N for which no term x_k is divisible by N. Let&#39;s consider primes again. If we can find a prime p such that the sequence x_n modulo p never hits 0, then p is such an N.To find such a prime, maybe consider primes p where the polynomial P(x) mod p has no roots, i.e., P(x) ≡0 mod p has no solution. But even if P(x) ≡0 mod p has a solution, starting from 1, we might not reach that solution.Alternatively, consider that if P(x) is of degree ≥2, then the growth rate of x_n is exponential or higher, so the sequence will outpace any given N. However, this is not sufficient, because even if the terms grow quickly, some term might still be divisible by N. But perhaps for primes p where P has certain properties, the sequence modulo p cycles without hitting 0.Alternatively, take p to be a prime divisor of P(1) - 2. Wait, since x1 =1, x2 = P(1). If we take p dividing x2 -2, then x2 ≡2 mod p. Then, x3 = P(x2) ≡ P(2) mod p, etc. Maybe this can be used to construct a prime where the sequence cycles.Alternatively, think about the difference between P(x) and x +1. If P(x) ≠ x +1, then their difference Q(x) = P(x) - (x +1) is a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, there exists some integer k where Q(k) ≠0, so P(k) ≠k +1.But how to use this?Alternatively, suppose that Q(x) = P(x) - x -1 is not identically zero. Then, Q(x) is a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, it has a root only at finitely many x, unless it&#39;s the zero polynomial. Therefore, for all sufficiently large x, Q(x) ≠0, so P(x) ≠x +1. But since we need P(n) &gt;n for all positive integers n, Q(x) must be positive for all x ≥1. Wait, Q(x) = P(x) -x -1. If Q(x) is non-negative for all x ≥1, then P(x) ≥x +1 for all x ≥1.But Q(x) is a polynomial, so if it&#39;s not identically zero, it must tend to infinity or negative infinity as x grows. Since P(n) &gt;n for all n, Q(n) = P(n) -n -1 ≥0 -1, but actually, Q(n) must be non-negative because P(n) &gt;n implies P(n) ≥n +1 (since P(n) is an integer greater than n). Therefore, Q(n) = P(n) -n -1 ≥0 for all n. So Q is a non-negative polynomial for all positive integers x, and it&#39;s not identically zero. Therefore, Q(x) must tend to infinity as x approaches infinity. Therefore, P(x) =x +1 + Q(x), where Q(x) is a non-negative polynomial that tends to infinity. Hence, P(x) is of degree at least 2.But how does this help? If Q(x) is non-negative and tends to infinity, then P(x) grows faster than x +1. Therefore, the sequence x_n would grow faster than the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., which is the case for P(x) =x +1. However, in the problem&#39;s condition, the sequence must contain terms divisible by every N. If the sequence grows too quickly, perhaps missing some N&#39;s.But how can we formalize this?Perhaps by considering that for a polynomial P of degree ≥2, the sequence x_n grows too quickly to be divisible by all N. For example, take N to be a prime number larger than any term in the sequence before it. Wait, but the sequence is infinite, so for any N, there exists a term x_k with x_k ≥N. But even so, how do we ensure that x_k is divisible by N?Alternatively, take N to be a prime that doesn&#39;t divide any of the terms x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}, where k is such that x_{k} &gt; N. But if the sequence grows too quickly, maybe after some point, all terms are congruent to some residue modulo N that isn&#39;t 0. Hence, if the sequence modulo N becomes periodic or gets stuck in a cycle, then if 0 isn&#39;t in that cycle, N doesn&#39;t divide any term.But how to show that such a prime N exists?Alternatively, use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Suppose that for different primes, the sequence modulo p doesn&#39;t cover 0. If we can find a prime p such that 0 is not in the orbit of 1 modulo p, then p is a witness that the sequence doesn&#39;t satisfy the divisibility condition. Therefore, if we can show that for any P(x) ≠x +1, there exists such a prime p, then we are done.Alternatively, consider that the sequence generated by P(x) =x +1 is the natural numbers, which obviously covers all residues. For any other polynomial, the sequence is different. Perhaps the key is that for P(x) =x +1, the sequence is co-finite in the integers, but for any other polynomial, the sequence has a different structure.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider specific properties of P(x) =x +1. The sequence it generates is 1,2,3,..., so for any N, the N-th term is N, which is divisible by N. Therefore, this sequence works. For any other polynomial, the sequence skips numbers or grows too quickly.But how to make this precise?Suppose that P(x) is of degree d ≥1. If d =1, then as discussed, only P(x) =x +1 works. For d ≥2, let&#39;s assume that P(x) is of the form x +1 + Q(x), where Q(x) is a non-zero polynomial with non-negative coefficients, but this might not necessarily be the case. However, since P(n) &gt;n for all n, as previously noted, Q(n) = P(n) -n -1 ≥0.Therefore, Q(n) is non-negative for all n ≥1. Since Q(x) is a non-zero polynomial, it must tend to infinity as x tends to infinity. Therefore, P(n) =n +1 + Q(n) tends to infinity faster than linearly. Hence, the sequence x_n grows faster than the sequence 1,2,3,...Now, let&#39;s consider a prime number p. Suppose that p divides some term x_k in the sequence. Then, x_{k+1} = P(x_k) ≡ P(0) mod p, since x_k ≡0 mod p. Therefore, x_{k+1} ≡P(0) mod p. Similarly, x_{k+2} = P(x_{k+1}) ≡P(P(0)) mod p, and so on.Therefore, once the sequence hits 0 modulo p, the subsequent terms are determined by iterating P starting from P(0) mod p. Therefore, if we can ensure that starting from 1, the sequence never reaches 0 mod p, then p does not divide any term.Alternatively, if P(0) ≡1 mod p, then x_{k+1} ≡1 mod p, x_{k+2} ≡P(1) mod p, etc. So if the sequence ever reaches 0 mod p, the next term is P(0) mod p, which could potentially lead to a cycle. However, if P(0) ≡1 mod p, then after hitting 0, the next term is 1, leading to a cycle 0,1,P(1), etc. But this is speculative.Alternatively, suppose we choose a prime p that divides x_2 -2. Since x_2 =P(1). If P(1) ≠2, then x_2 -2 is a non-zero integer, so it has a prime divisor p. Then, modulo p, x_2 ≡2 mod p. Then, x_3 = P(x_2) ≡P(2) mod p, x_4 = P(x_3) ≡P(P(2)) mod p, etc. If we can show that this sequence modulo p never reaches 0, then p is a prime not dividing any term of the sequence.But how can we ensure that? For example, if P(2) ≡1 mod p, then x_3 ≡1 mod p, and then x_4 ≡P(1) ≡2 mod p, leading to a cycle 2,1,2,1,... which never reaches 0. Therefore, if there exists a prime p dividing x_2 -2 (which is P(1)-2) such that P(2) ≡1 mod p and P(1) ≡2 mod p, then modulo p, the sequence cycles between 1 and 2, never reaching 0. Hence, such a prime p would not divide any term of the sequence.Therefore, if we can show that such a prime exists when P(x) ≠x +1, then we are done.Let&#39;s formalize this. Suppose that P(1) ≠2. Then x_2 =P(1) ≠2, so x_2 -2 is a non-zero integer. Let p be a prime divisor of x_2 -2. Then, modulo p, x_2 ≡2 mod p. Now, x_3 =P(x_2) ≡P(2) mod p. If P(2) ≡1 mod p, then x_3 ≡1 mod p, and x_4 =P(1) ≡2 mod p (since x_2 =P(1) ≡2 mod p). Therefore, the sequence modulo p cycles between 1 and 2: 1,2,1,2, etc., never reaching 0. Hence, 0 mod p is never achieved, so p does not divide any term of the sequence. Therefore, such a prime p contradicts the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, if P(1) ≠2, then there exists a prime p (dividing P(1)-2) such that no term in the sequence is divisible by p. Therefore, to satisfy the problem&#39;s condition, we must have P(1)=2.Similarly, if P(1)=2, then x_2=2. Then x_3=P(2). To ensure that 3 divides some term in the sequence. Suppose x_3 =P(2). If P(2)=3, then x_3=3, and so on. If P(2)≠3, then similar reasoning: if P(2)≠3, then x_3 -3 is a non-zero integer, take a prime divisor p of x_3 -3. Then modulo p, x_3 ≡3 mod p. If P(3) ≡1 mod p, then x_4 ≡1 mod p, x_5 ≡P(1)=2 mod p, x_6 ≡P(2)≡3 mod p, and so on, cycling through 1,2,3,... but unless 0 is in the cycle, it won&#39;t be reached. But 0 is not in the cycle, so p doesn&#39;t divide any term.Therefore, to prevent this from happening, we must have P(2)=3. Continuing this line of reasoning, if we suppose that P(k)=k +1 for all k, then the sequence is 1,2,3,..., which works. If at any point P(k)≠k +1, then similar to the above, we can construct a prime p that divides P(k) - (k +1), leading to a cycle that doesn&#39;t include 0 modulo p. Hence, forcing P(k)=k +1 for all k, which for a polynomial means P(x)=x +1.Therefore, inductively, we can show that if P(x) ≠x +1, then there exists some k where P(k)≠k +1, and then taking the least such k, we can construct a prime p that divides P(k) - (k +1), leading to a contradiction.Let me try to formalize this induction argument.Base case: k=1. If P(1)≠2, then as above, there exists a prime p dividing P(1)-2, leading to a contradiction. Hence, P(1)=2.Assume that for all m &lt;k, P(m)=m +1. Now consider P(k). If P(k)≠k +1, then consider the prime p dividing P(k) - (k +1). Then, modulo p, P(k) ≡k +1 mod p. Now, since the sequence up to x_{k} is 1,2,...,k (since P(m)=m +1 for m &lt;k). Then, x_{k+1}=P(k)≡k +1 mod p. Therefore, x_{k+1}≡k +1 mod p. Now, if k +1 ≡0 mod p, then p divides k +1. But p divides P(k) - (k +1) and p divides k +1. Hence, p divides P(k) - (k +1) and p divides k +1, so p divides P(k) - (k +1) + (k +1) = P(k). But P(k) ≡k +1 mod p, so P(k) ≡0 mod p implies k +1 ≡0 mod p, so p divides k +1. Therefore, p is a prime dividing both k +1 and P(k) - (k +1). Therefore, P(k) ≡k +1 mod p, but since p divides k +1, this implies P(k) ≡0 mod p. However, P(k) is congruent to 0 mod p, but x_{k+1} = P(k) ≡0 mod p. Therefore, in this case, x_{k+1} is divisible by p, so p divides x_{k+1}, which is in the sequence. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t give us a contradiction.Wait, perhaps this approach is not sufficient.Alternatively, if P(k) ≠k +1, then x_{k+1} = P(k) ≠k +1. Let’s take p as a prime divisor of x_{k+1} - (k +1). Then, modulo p, x_{k+1} ≡k +1 mod p. Then, x_{k+2} = P(x_{k+1}) ≡P(k +1) mod p. If P(k +1) ≡k +2 mod p, then x_{k+2} ≡k +2 mod p, and so on. However, if P(k +1) ≡ something else, maybe we can create a cycle. However, if P(m)=m +1 for all m ≤k, then x_{k+1}=k +1, but we supposed P(k)≠k +1, so this is a contradiction. Wait, maybe my induction step is not correctly set up.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that if P(x) is a polynomial that agrees with x +1 at infinitely many points, then P(x) =x +1. Since a polynomial of degree d is determined by d +1 points, if P(k)=k +1 for infinitely many k, then P(x) must be x +1. Therefore, if P(x) ≠x +1, then there are only finitely many k for which P(k)=k +1. Therefore, there exists some minimal k where P(k)≠k +1. Let&#39;s take the minimal such k. Then, for all m &lt;k, P(m)=m +1. Therefore, the sequence x_1=1, x_2=2,...,x_k =k. Then, x_{k+1}=P(k)≠k +1. Let’s denote x_{k+1}=P(k)=k +1 +c, where c ≥1 (since P(k) &gt;k). Now, consider the prime divisors of c. Let p be a prime divisor of c. Then, x_{k+1}=k +1 +c ≡k +1 mod p. Therefore, x_{k+1}≡k +1 mod p. Then, x_{k+2}=P(x_{k+1})≡P(k +1) mod p. But since k was the first place where P(k)≠k +1, then for m ≤k, P(m)=m +1. However, P(k +1) could be anything. Wait, no, k is the minimal integer where P(k)≠k +1. So, if k is the minimal such integer, then P(k)≠k +1, but for m &lt;k, P(m)=m +1. However, k +1 is greater than k, so P(k +1) could still be different from k +2.But how does this help us? Let&#39;s suppose p divides c, so c =p * t. Then, x_{k+1}=k +1 + p * t ≡k +1 mod p. Then, x_{k+2}=P(k +1 +p * t). But P is a polynomial with integer coefficients, so P(k +1 +p * t) ≡P(k +1) mod p. Therefore, x_{k+2} ≡P(k +1) mod p.If we can show that the sequence from x_{k+1} onward modulo p never reaches 0, then p doesn&#39;t divide any term of the sequence, which would contradict the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, we need to ensure that P(k +1) ≡ some value mod p that does not lead to 0.But since P(k) =k +1 +c =k +1 +p * t, and p divides c, which is at least 1, so p ≤c. Also, since P(k) &gt;k, c ≥1, so p is a prime divisor of c ≥1.However, since P(k +1) could be anything, how can we ensure that the sequence doesn&#39;t reach 0 modulo p?Alternatively, perhaps if we choose p such that p divides c but p does not divide any of the subsequent terms. For example, if the sequence modulo p enters a cycle that doesn&#39;t include 0.But this seems vague. Let&#39;s try a concrete example.Suppose P(x) =x +1 for x &lt;k, and P(k) =k +2. So, the first k terms are 1,2,...,k, then x_{k+1}=k +2. Then, let&#39;s take c=1, so p=2 (since c=1, which is prime). Then, modulo 2, the sequence is 1,0,1,0,... starting from x_{k+1}=k +2. If k is odd, then k +2 is odd +2 = odd + even = odd, so k +2 is odd. Wait, but modulo 2, k +2 ≡k mod 2. So if k is odd, then x_{k+1}=k +2 ≡1 mod 2, then x_{k+2}=P(k +2). If P(k +2)=k +3 ≡0 mod 2 (since k is odd, k +3 is even). So x_{k+2} ≡0 mod 2. Therefore, 2 divides x_{k+2}. Therefore, in this case, even though we changed P(k) to k +2, the sequence still reaches 0 mod 2 at x_{k+2}. Therefore, this prime p=2 does divide a term in the sequence.But this contradicts our earlier idea. Therefore, in this case, even though we modified P(k) to be k +2, the sequence still hits 0 mod 2. Hence, the prime p=2 is not a witness.But wait, in this case, p divides c=1, but since c=1, p=1, which is not prime. Wait, no, in this case, if P(k)=k +2, then c=1. So x_{k+1}=k +1 +1=k +2. Then, c=1, so p=1 is not prime. Therefore, my previous example is invalid because c=1 has no prime divisors.Wait, so let&#39;s take c=2. Suppose P(k)=k +3. Then c=2. So p=2, a prime divisor of c=2. Then, x_{k+1}=k +3 ≡k +1 mod 2. If k is odd, then k +1 is even, so x_{k+1}≡0 mod 2. But then 2 divides x_{k+1}, so p=2 divides a term in the sequence. Similarly, if k is even, then k +1 is odd, so x_{k+1}=k +3 ≡odd +3=even, so x_{k+1}≡0 mod 2. Therefore, in either case, x_{k+1} is even, so 2 divides x_{k+1}. Therefore, even though we set P(k)=k +3, the term x_{k+1} is divisible by 2.Therefore, in this case, the prime p=2 does divide a term in the sequence.Therefore, this approach doesn&#39;t work because the modified term x_{k+1} is congruent to k +1 mod p, but p divides c=2, so k +1 +c ≡k +1 mod p. But if c is a multiple of p, then k +1 +c ≡k +1 mod p. However, depending on k mod p, this can sometimes be 0.Wait, this seems too vague. Maybe we need a different approach.Let’s consider that if P(x) is not equal to x +1, then there exists a prime p such that the mapping x ↦ P(x) mod p is not a bijection. Since for P(x) =x +1, the mapping is a bijection modulo every p (it&#39;s just adding 1, which permutes residues). If P(x) is not x +1, then for some p, the mapping x ↦ P(x) mod p is not a bijection. If it&#39;s not a bijection, it&#39;s either not injective or not surjective. If it&#39;s not surjective, then there exists some residue that&#39;s never hit, so maybe 0 is never hit. However, permutation polynomials modulo p are special, and for linear polynomials, they are permutations if the coefficient of x is invertible mod p. For higher-degree polynomials, it&#39;s more complex.Alternatively, since the problem&#39;s condition requires that for every N, there exists a term divisible by N, which is equivalent to the sequence being surjective modulo every N. In particular, it must be surjective modulo every prime power. But handling prime powers is more complicated.Another angle: If the sequence contains every natural number, then P(x) must be x +1. Because the sequence is 1, P(1), P(P(1)), etc. If this sequence is exactly the natural numbers starting from 1, then P(x) must map each natural number to the next, i.e., P(x) =x +1.But the problem&#39;s condition is weaker: the sequence doesn&#39;t need to contain every natural number, just that for every N, there&#39;s some term divisible by N. So the sequence could skip numbers but must have terms divisible by every N. For example, the sequence could be 2, 4, 8, 16,... which are powers of 2. This sequence doesn&#39;t contain numbers divisible by 3, 5, etc. So to satisfy the condition, the sequence must be much denser.However, if the polynomial is x +1, the sequence is all natural numbers, so it&#39;s the densest possible. For any other polynomial, the sequence either grows too quickly or has a different structure that might miss some N&#39;s.But we need to prove that only x +1 works. So perhaps we can use mathematical induction on N. Suppose that for all N ≤k, there exists a term in the sequence divisible by N. Then, we need to show that for N=k +1, there exists a term divisible by k +1. But this doesn&#39;t directly help.Alternatively, assume that P(x) ≠x +1 and derive a contradiction by showing that there exists some N for which no term is divisible by N.Another idea: Consider the behavior modulo N. For the sequence to contain a term divisible by N, there must exist some k such that x_k ≡0 mod N. This means that starting from x1=1, iterating P modulo N must eventually reach 0.If for some N, the function P modulo N does not have 0 in its forward orbit from 1, then such N is a counterexample, and the sequence doesn&#39;t satisfy the condition.Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that if P(x) ≠x +1, then there exists some N for which 0 is not in the forward orbit of 1 under P modulo N.To prove this, suppose P(x) ≠x +1. Then there exists some integer m where P(m) ≠m +1. Let m be the smallest such integer. Since for all integers less than m, P(k)=k +1, then the sequence up to x_m is 1,2,...,m. Then, x_{m+1}=P(m)≠m +1. Let’s set c=P(m)-(m +1). Since P(m) &gt;m, we have c ≥1.Now, consider N=m +c +1. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, take a prime divisor p of c. Since c ≥1, there exists at least one prime p dividing c. Then, modulo p, we have x_{m+1}=P(m)=m +1 +c ≡m +1 mod p (since p divides c). Thus, x_{m+1}≡m +1 mod p. Now, consider the next term x_{m+2}=P(x_{m+1})=P(m +1). Since m is the minimal integer where P(m)≠m +1, for m +1, P(m +1) could be anything. However, modulo p, we have x_{m+2}=P(m +1) mod p.If we can show that starting from x_{m+1}≡m +1 mod p, the subsequent terms never reach 0 mod p, then p is a prime not dividing any term of the sequence, which contradicts the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, we need to ensure that the sequence modulo p cycles without reaching 0.Suppose that after x_{m+1}≡m +1 mod p, we have x_{m+2}=P(m +1) mod p. If P(m +1) ≡m +2 mod p, then x_{m+2}=m +2 mod p. Similarly, x_{m+3}=P(m +2) mod p. If P(k)=k +1 for all k ≥m +1, then the sequence would continue as m +2, m +3, etc., modulo p. However, since p divides c=P(m)-(m +1), and c ≥1, p ≤c. But m +1 &lt;p (since p divides c, and c=P(m)-(m +1). If p is larger than m +1, then m +1 modulo p is just m +1, so x_{m+1}=m +1, x_{m+2}=P(m +1), and so on.But if P(m +1) ≠m +2, then x_{m+2}=P(m +1) could be different from m +2, leading to different residues modulo p. However, if P(m +1)=m +2, then the sequence continues as m +2, m +3, etc., modulo p. In this case, since p divides c=P(m)-(m +1), and c ≥1, p ≤c. But if p is a prime dividing c, then p ≤c. However, m +1 +c =P(m). If p divides c, then c ≥p, so m +1 +c ≥m +1 +p. But unless m +1 +p &lt;p, which is impossible, so the sequence modulo p would eventually reach p, which is 0 mod p. Wait, if the sequence continues as m +1, m +2, ..., p-1, p, then when it reaches p, that term is 0 mod p. Therefore, in this case, p would divide x_{p -m} or something like that.But this seems too hand-wavy. Let&#39;s make this concrete with an example.Let’s suppose m=2, so the minimal integer where P(m)≠m +1. Therefore, P(1)=2, P(2)≠3. Let’s say P(2)=4. Then c=P(2)-3=1. Take p=3, which is a prime divisor of c=1. Wait, p=3 doesn&#39;t divide c=1. So this example is invalid. Let&#39;s choose c=2. So P(2)=5, then c=2. Then p=2. Modulo 2, the sequence is x1=1, x2=2≡0 mod 2, so 2 divides x2. Hence, p=2 divides x2. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Another example: m=3, P(1)=2, P(2)=3, P(3)=5 (so c=1). Then, p= any prime divisor of c=1, which doesn&#39;t exist. Hence, invalid.Another example: m=3, P(3)=6. Then c=3. Prime divisor p=3. Modulo 3, the sequence is x1=1, x2=2, x3=0 mod 3. So 3 divides x3. Hence, p=3 divides x3. Therefore, this doesn&#39;t work.Wait, so in this case, even though we set P(m)=m +c with c ≥1, the prime divisor p of c divides x_{m+1} or some earlier term.Wait, maybe the problem is that when we choose p as a divisor of c, which is P(m) - (m +1), then p divides x_{m+1} - (m +1). Therefore, x_{m+1} ≡m +1 mod p. If m +1 ≡0 mod p, then x_{m+1} ≡0 mod p, so p divides x_{m+1}. But m +1 ≡0 mod p implies p divides m +1. But p divides c =P(m) - (m +1), so p divides P(m) - (m +1) + (m +1) =P(m). Since P(m) &gt;m, and p divides P(m), but if p divides m +1, then p ≤m +1. However, P(m) =m +1 +c, and c ≥1, so P(m) ≥m +2. Therefore, p divides P(m) and p divides m +1. But since P(m) =m +1 +c, and p divides both P(m) and m +1, then p divides c. But p divides m +1 and p divides c, but c =P(m) - (m +1). So this is possible.For example, take m=1, P(1)=3 (so c=2). Then p=2 divides c=2. Then, m +1=2, which is divisible by p=2. Then, x_{m+1}=3, which is congruent to 1 mod 2. Wait, x_{m+1}=3≡1 mod 2. Then x_{m+2}=P(3). If P(3)=4, then x_{m+2}=4≡0 mod 2, so 2 divides x_{m+2}. Therefore, in this case, even though we had p=2 dividing c=2 and m +1=2, the sequence still hits 0 mod p later on.Therefore, this approach of taking p dividing c may not necessarily lead to a prime that doesn&#39;t divide any term, because even if p divides c and m +1, the sequence could still reach 0 mod p in a later term.Therefore, perhaps this line of reasoning is not sufficient. We need a different approach.Let’s consider that if P(x) is not x +1, then there exists a prime p such that the mapping P modulo p has no root, i.e., the equation P(x) ≡0 mod p has no solution. If such a prime exists, then since the sequence modulo p starts at 1 and iterates P, never reaching 0, which would contradict the problem&#39;s condition. However, if P(x) ≡0 mod p has a solution, then it&#39;s possible that starting from 1, the sequence could reach 0. But how to ensure that such a prime p exists when P(x) ≠x +1?Alternatively, consider the constant term of P(x). Let’s write P(x) =a_d x^d + ... +a_1 x +a_0. If P(x) ≠x +1, then either the degree d ≥2, or the polynomial is linear but with a different constant term. If d ≥2, then for large primes p, P(x) modulo p is a polynomial of degree d ≥2. For such primes, the equation P(x) ≡0 mod p has at most d solutions. Therefore, the probability that starting from 1 and iterating P will hit one of these roots is low, especially for large p.But this is heuristic. To make it precise, maybe use the fact that if P(x) is not x +1, then there are infinitely many primes p for which P(x) ≡0 mod p has no solutions. By Chebotarev&#39;s density theorem or Dirichlet&#39;s theorem, but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, use the fact that if P(x) -x -1 is not identically zero, then there are infinitely many primes p for which there exists an integer x such that P(x) ≡x +1 mod p. But this might not help.Another idea: Consider the difference Q(x) =P(x) -x -1. If Q(x) is not identically zero, then there exists some prime p dividing Q(x) for some x. By the polynomial identity theorem, since Q(x) is not zero, it has at least one root modulo some prime p. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, for primes p where Q(x) has a root, then there exists x such that P(x) ≡x +1 mod p. But this doesn&#39;t directly help.This seems too vague. Let&#39;s think differently.Suppose that P(x) is not x +1. Then, the sequence generated by P diverges from the sequence generated by x +1 at some point. Let’s say the first difference is at x_{k+1}=P(k)≠k +1. Then, x_{k+1}=k +1 +c for some c ≥1. Let’s take N=k +1 +c. Then, x_{k+1}=N. Therefore, N divides x_{k+1}, so the condition is satisfied for N=k +1 +c. But this doesn&#39;t help us find an N that is not divided by any term.Wait, perhaps instead of looking at N=k +1 +c, look at N=k +1. Since x_{k+1}=k +1 +c &gt;k +1, so x_{k+1} &gt;k +1. But the term x_{k}=k, which is less than N=k +1. Then, x_{k+1} &gt;N, but does x_{k+1} ≡0 mod N? Not necessarily. For example, if N=k +1, then x_{k+1}=k +1 +c ≡c mod N. If c=1, then x_{k+1}=k +2 ≡1 mod k +1. So x_{k+1}≡1 mod N. Then, x_{k+2}=P(x_{k+1})=P(k +2). If P(k +2)=k +3 ≡2 mod N, and so on. So the sequence modulo N=k +1 would be 1,2,3,...,k,1,2,3,...,k, etc., never reaching 0. Therefore, N=k +1 does not divide any term in the sequence.Wait, this seems promising. Let&#39;s elaborate.Suppose that P(x) ≠x +1, and let k be the minimal integer where P(k)≠k +1. Then, the sequence starts as 1,2,...,k, and then x_{k+1}=P(k)≠k +1. Let’s denote N=k +1. We want to see if N divides any term in the sequence.The term x_{k}=k &lt;N. The next term x_{k+1}=P(k) &gt;k, so x_{k+1} ≥k +1. If x_{k+1}=k +1, then P(k)=k +1, contradicting the choice of k. Therefore, x_{k+1} ≥k +2. Now, consider the sequence modulo N=k +1. The terms before x_{k} are 1,2,...,k, which are 1,2,...,k mod N. Then, x_{k+1}=P(k)≡c mod N, where c=P(k) mod N. Since P(k) &gt;k, and N=k +1, P(k) ≥k +1, so c=P(k) -m*N for some m ≥0. Since P(k) ≥k +1, c is in {0,1,...,k}. But P(k)≠k +1, so c≠0. Because if c=0, then P(k)=m*N=m*(k +1), but since P(k) &gt;k, m≥1, but then P(k)=m*(k +1) ≥k +1. However, c=P(k) mod N can be 0 only if P(k) is a multiple of N=k +1. But if P(k) is a multiple of N=k +1, then x_{k+1} is divisible by N, so N divides x_{k+1}. Otherwise, c≠0.But if P(k) is not a multiple of N=k +1, then x_{k+1}≡c mod N, where c ≠0. Then, x_{k+2}=P(x_{k+1})≡P(c) mod N. Since c ∈{1,2,...,k}, and for all m ≤k, P(m)=m +1. Therefore, P(c)=c +1 mod N. Therefore, x_{k+2}=c +1 mod N. Similarly, x_{k+3}=P(c +1)= (c +1) +1 mod N (since c +1 ≤k +1=N, and if c +1 &lt;N, then P(c +1)=c +2 mod N. If c +1=N, then P(c +1)=P(N)=P(k +1). But P(k +1) could be anything. Wait, but since k is the minimal integer where P(k)≠k +1, and k +1 &gt;k, we don&#39;t know if P(k +1)=k +2 or not.However, in this case, if c +1=N=k +1, then x_{k+2}=N, so x_{k+2}=P(c)=N. But P(c)=c +1=N, which would mean P(c)=c +1. But c ∈{1,2,...,k}, so for c ≤k, P(c)=c +1. Therefore, if c +1=N=k +1, then c=k, so x_{k+1}=P(k)≡k mod N. But P(k)≡k mod N implies P(k)=k +m*N=k +m*(k +1). Therefore, P(k) =k +m*(k +1). Since P(k) &gt;k, m ≥1. Therefore, P(k) =k +m*(k +1) ≥k + (k +1)=2k +1. But x_{k+1}=P(k) ≥2k +1, which is greater than N=k +1. Then, modulo N=k +1, x_{k+1}≡k mod N. Therefore, x_{k+2}=P(x_{k+1})=P(k +m*(k +1)). But P(k +m*(k +1)) ≡P(k) mod (k +1), since k +m*(k +1)≡k mod (k +1). Therefore, x_{k+2}≡P(k)≡k mod N. Therefore, the sequence modulo N=k +1 becomes:x_{k} =k mod Nx_{k+1}≡k mod Nx_{k+2}≡k mod NAnd so on. Therefore, once it reaches x_{k+1}≡k mod N, it stays there. Therefore, 0 mod N is never reached. Hence, N=k +1 does not divide any term in the sequence beyond x_{k}=k, which is less than N. Therefore, N=k +1 does not divide any term in the sequence, contradicting the problem&#39;s condition. Therefore, our assumption that P(x)≠x +1 leads to a contradiction.Therefore, P(x) must be x +1.This seems to be a valid argument. Let&#39;s recap:Assume that P(x) ≠x +1. Let k be the minimal positive integer where P(k)≠k +1. Then, the sequence up to x_k is 1,2,...,k. The next term x_{k+1}=P(k)≠k +1. Let N=k +1. We analyze the sequence modulo N.Since x_{k}=k &lt;N, x_{k+1}=P(k). If P(k) is a multiple of N, then N divides x_{k+1}. However, if P(k) is not a multiple of N, then x_{k+1}≡c mod N where 1 ≤c ≤k. Then, applying P to c (since c ≤k, P(c)=c +1), so x_{k+2}=c +1 mod N. Continuing this way, we get x_{k+m}≡c +m -1 mod N. When m reaches N -c, x_{k+m}≡c + (N -c) -1 =N -1 mod N. The next term would be x_{k+m+1}=P(N -1) mod N. However, since N -1 =k, and k is the minimal integer where P(k)≠k +1, we have P(N -1)=P(k)=x_{k+1}=P(k)≡c mod N. Therefore, the sequence modulo N becomes stuck in a cycle: c, c +1, ..., N -1, c, c +1, ..., never reaching 0. Therefore, N=k +1 does not divide any term in the sequence, which contradicts the problem&#39;s condition. Hence, our assumption that P(x)≠x +1 must be false.Therefore, P(x) must be equal to x +1.Final Answerboxed{P(x) = x + 1}&lt;/think&gt;Given a polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients such that for every positive integer ( n ), ( P(n) &gt; n ), and a sequence defined by ( x_1 = 1 ) and ( x_{n} = P(x_{n-1}) ), we need to prove that if every positive integer ( N ) divides some term in the sequence, then ( P(x) = x + 1 ).1. Key Observations:   - The sequence ( x_n ) is strictly increasing because ( P(n) &gt; n ) for all positive integers ( n ).   - The sequence must contain a term divisible by every positive integer ( N ).2. Linear Polynomials:   - If ( P(x) ) is linear, it must be of the form ( P(x) = x + c ). For ( P(x) ) to satisfy ( P(n) &gt; n ), ( c geq 1 ).   - If ( c &gt; 1 ), the sequence would be an arithmetic progression with difference ( c ), missing some residues modulo ( c ). Only ( c = 1 ) works, leading to ( P(x) = x + 1 ).3. Non-Linear Polynomials:   - Higher-degree polynomials grow too quickly, making it unlikely for the sequence to hit every modulus. For example, quadratic polynomials like ( P(x) = x^2 + 1 ) result in sequences that do not cover all residues modulo some primes.4. Modular Analysis:   - For a polynomial ( P(x) neq x + 1 ), there exists a minimal ( k ) such that ( P(k) neq k + 1 ). Let ( N = k + 1 ).   - The sequence modulo ( N ) starts as ( 1, 2, ldots, k ). The next term ( x_{k+1} = P(k) equiv c mod N ) where ( c neq 0 ).   - Subsequent terms are ( c + 1, c + 2, ldots mod N ), cycling through residues but never reaching 0 modulo ( N ).5. Contradiction:   - If ( P(x) neq x + 1 ), there exists ( N = k + 1 ) such that no term in the sequence is divisible by ( N ), contradicting the problem&#39;s condition.Thus, the only polynomial ( P(x) ) satisfying all conditions is ( P(x) = x + 1 ).[boxed{P(x) = x + 1}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🔑:</span>Assume the contrary. The polynomial Q(x)=P(x)-x is non-decreasing for all x greater than some M, as otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be positive, and it has to be bigger than 1 for each n.If there are infinitely many integers n such that P(n)=n+1 then we would have P(x)=x+1 (nonzero polynomial P(x)-x-1 can have only finitely many zeroes). Therefore there exists an index k in mathbb{N} such that x_{k}&gt;M and Pleft(x_{l}right)-x_{l} geq 2 for l geq k.Assume that d=x_{l+1}-x_{l} geq 2. Then d is a divisor of Pleft(x_{l+1}right)-Pleft(x_{l}right) i.e. of x_{l+2}-x_{l+1}. Since, if a equiv b(bmod d), then P(a) equiv P(b), by induction all the numbers x_{l}, x_{l+1}, ldots have the same remainder modulo d. If that remainder is not zero than no term of the sequence could be divisible by d^{m} for sufficiently large m which would contradict the assumptions.Hence x_{l} is divisible by x_{l+1}-x_{l} for all l geq k. Let x_{l}=c_{l}left(Pleft(x_{l}right)-x_{l}right). Then Pleft(x_{l}right)=frac{c_{l}+1}{c_{l}} x_{l} holds for infinitely many pairs of integers left(x_{l}, c_{l}right) such that x_{l} rightarrow infty. Because frac{c_{l}+1}{c_{l}} x_{l}=left(1+frac{1}{c_{l}}right) x_{l} leq 2 x_{l}, the degree of P cannot exceed 1 so that either P(x)=2 x or P(x)=x. Neither of these polynomials satisfy the given condition, and this is a contradiction.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-4ff500d3 data-v-4f6c926b><div class="review" data-v-4f6c926b><div class="review-title" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>❓:</span>If it is now 9:04 a.m., in 56 hours the time will be(A) 9:04 a.m.(B) 5:04 p.m.(C) 5:04 a.m.(D) 1:04 p.m.(E) 1:04 a.m.</div><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so the problem is: If it&#39;s currently 9:04 a.m., what time will it be in 56 hours? The options are from A to E. Let me figure this out step by step.First, I remember that there are 24 hours in a day. So, adding 24 hours to any time just brings us back to the same time but a day later. So, if I add 24 hours to 9:04 a.m., it will be 9:04 a.m. the next day. Similarly, adding another 24 hours (totaling 48 hours) would bring us to 9:04 a.m. two days later. But the question is asking for 56 hours. So, 56 hours is more than 2 days. Let me break it down. 24 hours is one day, so 56 divided by 24 would be... let me calculate that. 24 times 2 is 48, so 56 minus 48 is 8. So, 56 hours is equivalent to 2 days and 8 hours. So starting from 9:04 a.m., if I add 48 hours (which is two days), it will be 9:04 a.m. two days later. Then I need to add the remaining 8 hours. Adding 8 hours to 9:04 a.m. Let&#39;s see: 9:04 a.m. plus 8 hours would be 5:04 p.m. Because from 9 a.m., adding 8 hours would take us to 5 p.m. (since 9 + 8 = 17, which is 5 p.m. in 12-hour time). So 9:04 a.m. + 8 hours = 5:04 p.m.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify that again. If it&#39;s 9:04 a.m., adding 3 hours gets us to 12:04 p.m., then adding another 5 hours would be 5:04 p.m. Yeah, that&#39;s correct. So 8 hours added to 9:04 a.m. is indeed 5:04 p.m. Therefore, 56 hours later would be 5:04 p.m. two days later. But the options given are (A) 9:04 a.m., (B) 5:04 p.m., (C) 5:04 a.m., (D) 1:04 p.m., (E) 1:04 a.m. So, the answer would be option B, 5:04 p.m.?Wait a second, hold on. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let&#39;s do it another way. Instead of breaking it into days and hours, maybe count each hour step by step. But that would be tedious for 56 hours, but maybe for verification.Alternatively, let&#39;s convert the starting time to a 24-hour format to avoid confusion with a.m. and p.m. 9:04 a.m. is 09:04. Adding 56 hours. First, 24 hours brings us to 09:04 next day. Another 24 hours brings us to 09:04 the day after. Then adding the remaining 8 hours: 09:04 + 8 hours = 17:04, which is 5:04 p.m. So that seems correct. So 56 hours later is 5:04 p.m. two days later. So the answer should be B.But let me check again because sometimes when adding hours, if it crosses noon or midnight, we have to be careful. But in this case, adding 8 hours to 9:04 a.m. is straightforward. 9:04 a.m. plus 8 hours is 5:04 p.m., so that&#39;s 8 hours later. So over two days, it&#39;s the same as adding 56 hours.Alternatively, another way to think about it: 56 hours divided by 12 hours. Wait, that might not help. Let&#39;s see. 56 divided by 24 is 2 with a remainder of 8, as before. So the remainder is 8 hours, so adding 8 hours to the original time.Alternatively, maybe use modulo 12 or 24. Let&#39;s see. Since the time cycles every 24 hours, adding 56 hours is equivalent to adding 56 mod 24. 56 divided by 24 is 2*24=48, remainder 8. So 56 mod 24 is 8. So adding 8 hours to the original time. 9:04 a.m. plus 8 hours is 5:04 p.m. Therefore, the answer is B.But let me check once again because sometimes when people make mistakes in these problems, it&#39;s usually due to miscounting the days or the remaining hours. Let&#39;s suppose today is Monday 9:04 a.m. Adding 24 hours would be Tuesday 9:04 a.m. Adding another 24 hours would be Wednesday 9:04 a.m. Then adding 8 hours: 9:04 a.m. + 8 hours = 5:04 p.m. on Wednesday. So yes, the time is 5:04 p.m. So the answer is B.But wait, let me check the options again. Option B is 5:04 p.m., which is what we got. So that&#39;s correct. The other options: A is same time two days later, but since we have 56 hours, which is more than two days, so A is incorrect. C is 5:04 a.m., but we added 8 hours, which would be p.m., not a.m. So C is wrong. D is 1:04 p.m., but that&#39;s only 4 hours added, so that&#39;s not right. E is 1:04 a.m., which is even earlier. So B is correct.Wait, but hold on. Let me think if there&#39;s a possibility that daylight saving time could affect this? The problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about time zones or daylight saving, so we can assume a simple 24-hour cycle without any changes. So no, daylight saving is not a factor here.Another way: let&#39;s count the days and hours. 56 hours is 2 days and 8 hours. So starting from 9:04 a.m., adding two days gets us to the same time two days later, which is 9:04 a.m., and then adding 8 hours would make it 5:04 p.m. So yes, that&#39;s the same conclusion.Alternatively, let&#39;s compute total hours. 9:04 a.m. is 9 hours and 4 minutes. Adding 56 hours. So 9 + 56 = 65 hours. But 65 hours is 2 days (48 hours) plus 17 hours. Wait, hold on, that might not be the right way. Wait, maybe convert the starting time to minutes past midnight, then add 56 hours, then convert back.Starting at 9:04 a.m. is 9 hours and 4 minutes after midnight. So in minutes, that&#39;s 9*60 + 4 = 540 + 4 = 544 minutes.But adding 56 hours is 56*60 = 3360 minutes. Total minutes after addition: 544 + 3360 = 3904 minutes.Now, convert 3904 minutes back to days, hours, minutes. There are 1440 minutes in a day (24*60). So divide 3904 by 1440.3904 ÷ 1440. Let&#39;s see: 1440*2 = 2880. 3904 - 2880 = 1024 minutes remaining. So 2 days and 1024 minutes.Convert 1024 minutes to hours: 1024 ÷ 60. 60*17 = 1020, so 17 hours and 4 minutes. Therefore, total time is 2 days, 17 hours, and 4 minutes.Starting from midnight, adding 2 days brings us to midnight two days later. Then adding 17 hours and 4 minutes: midnight + 17h4m = 5:04 p.m. So that&#39;s consistent. Therefore, the time is 5:04 p.m., which is option B.Hmm, so both methods lead me to the same answer. So I think the correct answer is B, 5:04 p.m.But just to make sure, let&#39;s check another approach. Let&#39;s increment step by step in 12-hour increments.Starting at 9:04 a.m. Adding 12 hours would bring us to 9:04 p.m. Adding another 12 hours (total 24) brings us to 9:04 a.m. next day. Another 12 hours (36 total) brings us to 9:04 p.m. the next day. Another 12 hours (48 total) brings us to 9:04 a.m. two days later. Now, we have 56 hours total, which is 48 + 8. So from 9:04 a.m. two days later, adding 8 hours: 9:04 a.m. + 8 hours = 5:04 p.m. Yep, same result.So all these different ways of calculating lead to 5:04 p.m., which is option B. Therefore, I can confidently say the answer is B.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the time 56 hours after 9:04 a.m., we start by noting that 56 hours is equivalent to 2 days and 8 hours (since (56 = 24 times 2 + 8)). 1. Adding 48 hours (2 days) to 9:04 a.m. brings us back to 9:04 a.m. two days later.2. Adding the remaining 8 hours to 9:04 a.m.:   - From 9:04 a.m., adding 8 hours results in 5:04 p.m.Thus, 56 hours after 9:04 a.m. will be 5:04 p.m.[boxed{B}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out what time it will be 56 hours after 9:04 a.m. Hmm, let&#39;s see. Time problems can sometimes be a bit tricky because of the 12-hour clock cycle. Let me break this down step by step.First, I know that there are 24 hours in a day. So, every 24 hours, the time cycles back to the same time. That means if I add 24 hours to 9:04 a.m., it will still be 9:04 a.m. the next day. Similarly, adding another 24 hours (totaling 48 hours) would bring me to 9:04 a.m. two days later.Now, the problem is asking for 56 hours. Let me subtract 48 hours from 56 to see how many hours are left after accounting for two full days. 56 minus 48 is 8. So, after 48 hours (which is two days), we need to add another 8 hours to 9:04 a.m.Starting from 9:04 a.m., adding 8 hours would take us to 5:04 p.m. the same day. Wait, is that right? Let me check:9:04 a.m. plus 8 hours. If I add 1 hour, it becomes 10:04 a.m., then 11:04 a.m., 12:04 p.m., 1:04 p.m., 2:04 p.m., 3:04 p.m., 4:04 p.m., and finally 5:04 p.m. after 8 hours. So yes, 5:04 p.m. seems correct.But wait, the answer choices include 5:04 p.m. (option B) and 5:04 a.m. (option C). So I need to make sure I didn&#39;t mix up a.m. and p.m. here.Let me verify again. If it&#39;s 9:04 a.m. and I add 8 hours, moving from morning into the afternoon. Each hour after 12:00 p.m. becomes 1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m., etc. So starting at 9:04 a.m., adding 3 hours gets me to 12:04 p.m., and then adding the remaining 5 hours would bring me to 5:04 p.m. That&#39;s definitely in the afternoon. So 5:04 p.m. is correct. Therefore, option B?But wait, let me double-check my initial calculation. 56 hours divided by 24 hours per day gives me 2 days and 8 hours. So 2 days later would be the same time, 9:04 a.m., and then adding 8 hours would indeed be 5:04 p.m. So, yes, that&#39;s correct.Alternatively, another way to approach this is to convert the current time to a 24-hour format to avoid confusion between a.m. and p.m. Let&#39;s try that.9:04 a.m. in 24-hour time is 09:04. Adding 56 hours to this.First, 56 hours is 2 days (48 hours) and 8 hours. So adding 2 days to 09:04 brings us back to 09:04 on the second day. Then add 8 hours: 09:04 + 8 hours = 17:04, which is 5:04 p.m. in 12-hour time. So that&#39;s consistent with my previous answer. So option B is 5:04 p.m., which should be the correct answer.But let me check once more to be absolutely sure. If I start at 9:04 a.m. on, say, Monday, then 24 hours later is 9:04 a.m. Tuesday, another 24 hours is 9:04 a.m. Wednesday. Then adding 8 hours to Wednesday 9:04 a.m. brings us to 5:04 p.m. Wednesday. So the answer should be 5:04 p.m., which is option B.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check if there&#39;s any daylight saving time or something mentioned. But the problem doesn&#39;t mention anything about that, so I can safely ignore it. The question is purely about the time change, not about calendar days or daylight saving adjustments.Therefore, my conclusion is that 56 hours after 9:04 a.m. is 5:04 p.m., which is option B. But looking at the answer choices again: (A) 9:04 a.m., (B) 5:04 p.m., (C) 5:04 a.m., (D) 1:04 p.m., (E) 1:04 a.m. So yes, B is there.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a different way to approach this? Let me try adding the hours incrementally.Starting at 9:04 a.m. Adding 24 hours: 9:04 a.m. next day. Another 24 hours: 9:04 a.m. the day after. So that&#39;s 48 hours. Then we have 56 - 48 = 8 hours left. So adding 8 hours to 9:04 a.m.:9:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 10:04 a.m.10:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 11:04 a.m.11:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 12:04 p.m.12:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 1:04 p.m.1:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 2:04 p.m.2:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 3:04 p.m.3:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 4:04 p.m.4:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 5:04 p.m.Yes, that&#39;s 8 hours added to 9:04 a.m., resulting in 5:04 p.m. So again, option B.Wait, but another way people sometimes calculate is by dividing by 12-hour cycles. Let me see. 56 hours divided by 12 is 4 cycles of 12 hours with 8 hours remaining. Wait, that might not be the right approach here because we need to consider 24-hour days first.But just for the sake of thoroughness, let&#39;s see. 56 divided by 12 is 4 with a remainder of 8. Each 12-hour cycle flips between a.m. and p.m. Starting at 9:04 a.m., adding 12 hours brings us to 9:04 p.m. Adding another 12 hours is 9:04 a.m. the next day. Then another 12 hours is 9:04 p.m., and another 12 hours is 9:04 a.m. the following day. Then adding the remaining 8 hours. Wait, this seems more complicated, but let&#39;s see:Each 12 hours flips the a.m./p.m. So 56 hours is 4*12 = 48 hours plus 8 hours. 48 hours is 4 cycles of 12 hours. Starting from 9:04 a.m.:After 12 hours: 9:04 p.m. (1 cycle)After 24 hours: 9:04 a.m. (2 cycles)After 36 hours: 9:04 p.m. (3 cycles)After 48 hours: 9:04 a.m. (4 cycles)Then add 8 hours: 9:04 a.m. + 8 hours = 5:04 p.m. (same as before). So regardless of the method, it&#39;s 5:04 p.m. So the answer is B.But just to check why the other options are present. For example, option C is 5:04 a.m. Maybe someone might miscalculate and think that adding 8 hours to 9:04 a.m. is 5:04 p.m., but maybe someone else might confuse a.m. and p.m. But according to my calculations, it&#39;s p.m.Alternatively, maybe someone could think that 56 hours is 2 days and 8 hours, so adding 2 days is 9:04 a.m., then adding 8 hours is 5:04 p.m., but perhaps if they mistakenly added 8 hours to 9:04 p.m. instead of a.m., but that&#39;s not the case here.Wait, no. Wait, the 56 hours is starting from 9:04 a.m., so breaking into days: 24, 48, 56. So 48 hours later is 9:04 a.m. two days later, then adding 8 hours, which is definitely 5:04 p.m. So there&#39;s no confusion here.Alternatively, maybe someone could subtract instead of add? For example, 56 hours is 2 days and 8 hours, but maybe they subtract 8 hours? But that would be going back in time. But the question says &quot;in 56 hours the time will be,&quot; so it&#39;s forward.Alternatively, let&#39;s see what 56 hours is in days: 56 divided by 24 is 2.333... days. So 2 days and 0.333... days. 0.333... days is 8 hours (since 24*0.333 ≈ 8). So adding 2 days and 8 hours. So 9:04 a.m. plus 2 days is 9:04 a.m., then plus 8 hours is 5:04 p.m. Correct.Alternatively, converting the starting time to minutes past midnight might help. Let&#39;s try that. 9:04 a.m. is 9 hours and 4 minutes after midnight. So in minutes, that&#39;s (9*60) + 4 = 540 + 4 = 544 minutes.56 hours is 56*60 = 3360 minutes.Total minutes later: 544 + 3360 = 3904 minutes.Now, convert 3904 minutes back into days, hours, and minutes.There are 1440 minutes in a day (24*60). So 3904 divided by 1440.Calculate 1440*2 = 2880. 3904 - 2880 = 1024 minutes left.1024 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour: 1024 / 60 = 17 hours with a remainder of 4 minutes (since 17*60 = 1020, 1024 - 1020 = 4).So total time elapsed is 2 days, 17 hours, and 4 minutes.Starting from midnight, adding 2 days brings us to midnight two days later. Then adding 17 hours: midnight + 17 hours = 5 p.m. Then add 4 minutes: 5:04 p.m. Then add the initial time? Wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, maybe I messed up here.Wait, no. If we converted the starting time (9:04 a.m.) to minutes past midnight (544 minutes), then added 3360 minutes (56 hours), the total is 3904 minutes. Then converting 3904 minutes back into days, hours, minutes: 3904 / 1440 = 2 days with 1024 minutes remaining. Then 1024 minutes is 17 hours and 4 minutes. Therefore, the total time after 56 hours is 2 days, 17 hours, and 4 minutes. Starting from midnight, adding 2 days brings us to midnight, then adding 17 hours and 4 minutes brings us to 5:04 p.m. the next day. But wait, the starting time was 9:04 a.m., so adding 56 hours should be equivalent to adding 2 days and 8 hours. Wait, there&#39;s a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the method of converting to minutes past midnight is not the correct approach here because adding the total minutes directly would be equivalent to adding 56 hours to midnight, but we need to add it to 9:04 a.m. Wait, hold on. Let&#39;s clarify:Wait, if we take 9:04 a.m. as 544 minutes past midnight, then adding 3360 minutes (56 hours) gives us 544 + 3360 = 3904 minutes. Then converting 3904 minutes back to days, hours, minutes: 3904 ÷ 1440 = 2 days (2880 minutes) with 1024 minutes left. Then 1024 minutes ÷ 60 = 17 hours (1020 minutes) with 4 minutes left. So total is 2 days, 17 hours, 4 minutes. Therefore, starting from midnight, adding 2 days, 17 hours, 4 minutes brings us to 5:04 p.m. on the third day. Wait, but how does this relate to the original starting time?Wait, maybe I confused the starting point. If we take 9:04 a.m. as the starting point, adding 56 hours (which is 2 days and 8 hours) would bring us to 9:04 a.m. plus 2 days and 8 hours. So 9:04 a.m. + 2 days = 9:04 a.m. two days later, then adding 8 hours gives 5:04 p.m. So that&#39;s straightforward.But when converting to minutes past midnight, adding 56 hours, and then converting back, the result is 5:04 p.m. So both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is B.Alternatively, let&#39;s think about modulus 12. But maybe overcomplicating. Let me check if 56 hours is equivalent to how many half-days. 56 divided by 12 is 4 with remainder 8. But since 12 hours is half a day, each 12 hours flips between a.m. and p.m. So starting at 9:04 a.m., adding 12 hours brings us to 9:04 p.m. (1st 12). Adding another 12 hours is 9:04 a.m. (2nd 12). Third 12 hours is 9:04 p.m., fourth 12 hours is 9:04 a.m. Then 8 hours later is 5:04 p.m. So same result. So regardless of the method, it&#39;s 5:04 p.m., which is option B.Therefore, the correct answer is B) 5:04 p.m.Final Answerboxed{B}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the time 56 hours after 9:04 a.m., we first note that 56 hours is equivalent to 2 days and 8 hours. 1. Adding 48 hours (2 days) to 9:04 a.m. brings us back to 9:04 a.m. two days later.2. Adding the remaining 8 hours to 9:04 a.m.:   - 9:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 10:04 a.m.   - 10:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 11:04 a.m.   - 11:04 a.m. + 1 hour = 12:04 p.m.   - 12:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 1:04 p.m.   - 1:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 2:04 p.m.   - 2:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 3:04 p.m.   - 3:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 4:04 p.m.   - 4:04 p.m. + 1 hour = 5:04 p.m.Thus, 56 hours after 9:04 a.m. will be 5:04 p.m.[boxed{B}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🔑:</span>Since there are 24 hours in a day, then 56 hours is two full days ( 48 hours) plus an additional 8 hours.

When someone presses a button, it turns on if it is off and turns off if it is on. In addition, all buttons that share a side with a pressed button also change their state: from on to off or from off to on. Starting with all buttons off and pressing each button on the board once, one at a time and in any order, how many buttons will be on at the end?</div><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I have this problem here about a 6x6 grid of light buttons. When you press a button, it toggles its own state (on to off or off to on) and also toggles all its adjacent buttons (the ones sharing a side). All buttons start off, and we need to press each button exactly once. At the end, how many buttons will be on?Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step. Each button press affects the pressed button and its neighbors. Since all buttons start off, pressing a button once will turn it on, but if its neighbors are pressed later, they might turn it off again. Similarly, pressing a neighbor button will toggle the original button&#39;s state again. The challenge is to figure out the cumulative effect after pressing every button once.Maybe I can model this with some math. Let&#39;s consider each button as a variable that can be either 0 (off) or 1 (on). Each press is like adding 1 modulo 2 to the button and its neighbors. Since we&#39;re pressing each button exactly once, the total number of times each button is toggled is equal to 1 (from being pressed) plus the number of times its neighbors are pressed. Since every neighbor is pressed once, each button will be toggled 1 + number of adjacent presses.But wait, each button is pressed once, and each press affects its neighbors. So each button&#39;s state at the end is determined by how many times it was toggled. Since toggling an even number of times brings it back to off, and an odd number leaves it on.Therefore, the final state of each button is (1 + number of adjacent presses) mod 2. If this is 1, the button is on; if 0, it&#39;s off.But each button is pressed once, and each button is adjacent to 2, 3, or 4 buttons depending on its position. Wait, no: the adjacency is about how many neighbors each button has. Corner buttons have 2 neighbors, edge buttons (not corners) have 3 neighbors, and inner buttons have 4 neighbors. But each time a neighbor is pressed, the original button is toggled. So the number of times a button is toggled is 1 (from itself) plus the number of its neighbors (each pressed once). So the total toggles per button are:- Corner buttons: 1 (self) + 2 (neighbors) = 3 toggles. 3 mod 2 = 1 → on.- Edge buttons (non-corner): 1 + 3 = 4 toggles. 4 mod 2 = 0 → off.- Inner buttons: 1 + 4 = 5 toggles. 5 mod 2 = 1 → on.Wait, that seems too straightforward. So corners and inner buttons end up on, edges (including edges but not corners) end up off. So how many corners and inner buttons are there?In a 6x6 grid:- Corners: 4 buttons (each corner).- Edges: Each side has 6 buttons, but subtract the corners. So each side has 4 edge buttons. There are 4 sides, so 4*4=16 edge buttons.- Inner buttons: Total buttons = 36. Subtract corners (4) and edges (16), so 36 - 4 -16 = 16 inner buttons.Wait, but 4 corners, each side (excluding corners) has 4 edges, so 4*4=16 edges. Then inner buttons are 36 - 4 -16=16? Wait, 4+16=20, 36-20=16. Yes. So corners and inner buttons each have 4 and 16, totaling 20 buttons that are on.But wait, according to the previous logic, corners (4) have 3 toggles (on), edges (16) have 4 toggles (off), inner (16) have 5 toggles (on). So total on buttons: 4 +16=20. So the answer is 20?But let me verify this. Maybe my initial analysis is too simplistic. Because pressing a button affects its neighbors, but are there overlapping presses that might affect the same button multiple times? Wait, but we press each button exactly once. So for each button, the number of times it is toggled is 1 (from pressing itself) plus the number of times its neighbors are pressed (each neighbor is pressed once). So for a corner button, pressed once, and two neighbors pressed once each. So total toggles: 1 +2=3 → on. Similarly, edge buttons (non-corner) have 1 +3=4 toggles → off. Inner buttons:1 +4=5 → on.Thus, corners and inner buttons are on. Their counts are 4 and 16, so 20 total. That seems right.But let me test this with a smaller grid. For example, a 2x2 grid. All buttons are corners. Each button is pressed once. Each button is toggled 1 +2=3 times. So all 4 buttons would be on. But let&#39;s simulate:Start with all off: [ [0,0], [0,0] ]Press (1,1): toggles (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Now:[ [1,1], [1,0] ]Press (1,2): toggles (1,2), (1,1), (2,2). Now:(1,1) was 1, toggles to 0.(1,2) was 1, toggles to 0.(2,2) was 0, toggles to 1.State: [ [0,0], [1,1] ]Press (2,1): toggles (2,1), (1,1), (2,2). Now:(2,1) was 1, toggles to 0.(1,1) was 0, toggles to 1.(2,2) was 1, toggles to 0.State: [ [1,0], [0,0] ]Press (2,2): toggles (2,2), (1,2), (2,1). Now:(2,2) was 0, toggles to 1.(1,2) was 0, toggles to 1.(2,1) was 0, toggles to 1.Final state: [ [1,1], [1,1] ]All buttons are on. So 4 buttons on, which matches the formula: all are corners, 4 buttons, each toggled 3 times. So 4 on. Correct.Another test case: 3x3 grid.Corners:4, edges:4 (each side has 1 edge, 4 sides), center:1.Each corner button is pressed once, and each has two neighbors (edges). So each corner is toggled 1 +2=3 times (on).Edge buttons: each edge is pressed once, and each edge button has two neighbors (corners and center). Wait, in 3x3 grid, edge buttons (non-corner) are on the edges but not corners. Each has two neighbors: adjacent corner and center. Wait, no. Let me visualize:In a 3x3 grid:Positions:(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)(2,1) (2,2) (2,3)(3,1) (3,2) (3,3)Corners: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) → 4Edges: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) →4Center: (2,2)Each edge button, say (1,2), has neighbors (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). So three neighbors. So pressing each edge button once, the edge buttons themselves are toggled 1 +3=4 times (off). The center button (2,2) is adjacent to four edge buttons, so it&#39;s toggled 1 (itself) +4=5 times (on). Corners are toggled 1 (self) +2 (each corner has two edge neighbors) =3 (on). So total on buttons: 4 corners +1 center=5. Let&#39;s simulate:Start all off.Press (1,1): toggles (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).State:1 1 01 0 00 0 0Press (1,2): toggles (1,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2).State:0 0 11 1 00 0 0Press (1,3): toggles (1,3), (1,2), (2,3).State:0 1 01 1 10 0 0Press (2,1): toggles (2,1), (1,1), (2,2), (3,1).State:0 1 00 1 11 0 0Press (2,2): toggles (2,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).State:0 1 00 0 01 1 0Press (2,3): toggles (2,3), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3).State:0 1 10 1 01 1 1Press (3,1): toggles (3,1), (2,1), (3,2).State:0 1 10 1 00 0 1Press (3,2): toggles (3,2), (3,1), (3,3), (2,2).State:0 1 10 0 01 0 0Press (3,3): toggles (3,3), (3,2), (2,3).State:0 1 10 0 11 1 1Wait, after pressing all buttons once, the final state is:First row: 0 1 1Second row: 0 0 1Third row:1 1 1So on buttons: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). That&#39;s 6 buttons on. But according to our previous logic, it should be 4 corners and 1 center, total 5. But simulation shows 6. Hmm, discrepancy here. So maybe my initial analysis is flawed.Wait, let&#39;s check each button&#39;s toggle count:Each button is pressed once, so each button is toggled 1 + number of adjacent presses.In 3x3 grid:Corners: Each corner has two edges. So pressed once (themselves), plus two from edges. Total 3 toggles: on.Edges: Each edge has three neighbors (two corners and center). Wait, no. Let&#39;s see:Edge button (1,2) has neighbors (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). So three neighbors. So when edge buttons are pressed, they toggle three neighbors. But the edge button itself is pressed once and affected by its three neighbors. Wait, each edge button is pressed once (toggle itself and its neighbors). Then, when its neighbors are pressed, it is toggled again. For example, edge button (1,2):- Pressed once: toggles itself and (1,1), (1,3), (2,2).- Then, neighbors (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) are pressed, each pressing toggles (1,2). So three more toggles.Total toggles on (1,2): 1 (self) + 3 (neighbors) = 4 → off.Similarly, center button (2,2):- Pressed once: toggles itself and four edges.- Each edge is pressed once, so each edge press toggles the center. So center is toggled 1 (self) +4 (edges) =5 → on.But in the simulation, the center (2,2) ended up off. Wait, in the final state above, (2,2) was 0. But according to the math, center should be on. Wait, let&#39;s check the simulation steps again.Looking back at the simulation steps:After pressing all buttons, the final state for (2,2) is 0. According to the math, it should be toggled 5 times (on). But simulation shows it&#39;s off. So something is wrong here. Where is the mistake?Let me retrace the simulation steps carefully.Starting with all off:0 0 00 0 00 0 01. Press (1,1):(1,1) toggles on.Neighbors (1,2) and (2,1) toggle on.State:1 1 01 0 00 0 02. Press (1,2):(1,2) toggles (from on to off).Neighbors (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) toggle.So (1,1) was on, toggles off.(1,3) was off, toggles on.(2,2) was off, toggles on.State:0 0 11 1 00 0 03. Press (1,3):(1,3) toggles (from on to off).Neighbors (1,2) and (2,3) toggle.(1,2) was off, toggles on.(2,3) was off, toggles on.State:0 1 01 1 10 0 04. Press (2,1):(2,1) toggles (from on to off).Neighbors (1,1), (2,2), (3,1) toggle.(1,1) was off, toggles on.(2,2) was on, toggles off.(3,1) was off, toggles on.State:1 1 00 0 11 0 05. Press (2,2):(2,2) toggles (from off to on).Neighbors (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) toggle.(1,2) was on, toggles off.(2,1) was off, toggles on.(2,3) was on, toggles off.(3,2) was off, toggles on.State:1 0 01 1 01 1 06. Press (2,3):(2,3) toggles (from off to on).Neighbors (1,3), (2,2), (3,3) toggle.(1,3) was off, toggles on.(2,2) was on, toggles off.(3,3) was off, toggles on.State:1 0 11 0 11 1 17. Press (3,1):(3,1) toggles (from on to off).Neighbors (2,1), (3,2) toggle.(2,1) was on, toggles off.(3,2) was on, toggles off.State:1 0 10 0 10 0 18. Press (3,2):(3,2) toggles (from off to on).Neighbors (3,1), (3,3), (2,2) toggle.(3,1) was off, toggles on.(3,3) was on, toggles off.(2,2) was off, toggles on.State:1 0 10 1 11 1 09. Press (3,3):(3,3) toggles (from off to on).Neighbors (3,2), (2,3) toggle.(3,2) was on, toggles off.(2,3) was on, toggles off.Final state:1 0 10 1 01 0 1Wait, this is different from before. So in the final state, the on buttons are:(1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3). So 5 buttons on. Which matches the original prediction: 4 corners and 1 center. So the mistake in the previous simulation was probably an error in pressing order or tracking. So in the corrected simulation, it&#39;s 5 on buttons.Therefore, the mathematical approach seems valid. Each corner is toggled 3 times (on), each edge 4 times (off), center 5 times (on). So total 4 +1=5.So returning to the original 6x6 grid. Let&#39;s confirm.Each button pressed once. Each button&#39;s toggle count is 1 + number of neighbors. For a 6x6 grid:- Corner buttons: 1 +2=3 toggles (on).- Edge (non-corner):1 +3=4 toggles (off).- Inner buttons:1 +4=5 toggles (on).Number of corners:4.Number of inner buttons: The grid is 6x6. The inner buttons are those not on the edges. So the grid has 6 rows and 6 columns. Removing the first and last rows and columns, we get a 4x4 inner grid. So 16 inner buttons.Thus, total on buttons:4 +16=20.But let me verify with another small grid. Let&#39;s take 1x1 grid. Only one button. Press it once. Toggles once:1 (on). So correct. 1x1 grid, answer 1.Another test: 4x4 grid.Corners:4, edges: each side has 4-2=2 edge buttons, 4 sides: 8 edge buttons. Inner buttons:4x4 -4 -8=4. Wait, 4x4=16. 16-4 corners-8 edges=4 inner buttons.Each corner is toggled 3 times (on). Each inner button toggled 5 times (on). Edges toggled 4 (off). So total on:4 +4=8.Simulate? Maybe time-consuming, but let&#39;s attempt.But perhaps trust the mathematical model now, given that the 3x3 case works when carefully simulated.Therefore, in the 6x6 case, the answer should be 4 (corners) +16 (inner) =20.But let me think again. Wait, inner buttons in 6x6: from row 2 to 5 and column 2 to 5. So 4x4=16. Yes. Corners:4. Edges: total edge buttons are 6*4 -4=20 (each side has 6, 4 sides, minus 4 corners). So 20 edge buttons. 4+20+12=36? Wait, 4 corners +20 edges +12 inner=36. Wait, 6x6=36. 36-4-20=12. Wait, so my previous calculation was wrong.Wait, hold on. In a 6x6 grid:- Each side has 6 buttons. The four corners are shared by two sides. So total edge buttons: (6*4) -4=20. Because each corner is counted in two sides. So total edge buttons:20. Then inner buttons:36 -4 -20=12. Wait, but 6x6 grid, removing the outermost layer (first and last rows and columns) leaves a 4x4 grid, which is 16 buttons. So which is correct?Wait, 6x6 grid. The inner grid (not on the edges) would be rows 2-5 and columns 2-5, which is 4 rows and 4 columns, totaling 16 buttons. So earlier assertion was 16 inner buttons. But according to total buttons: 36 -4 (corners) -20 (edges)=12. There&#39;s a discrepancy here.Wait, no. Wait, edges: if we define edge buttons as those on the perimeter, but in a grid, the perimeter of a 6x6 grid is 6*4 -4=20. So:- Perimeter (edges and corners):20 buttons. But corners are part of the perimeter. So total perimeter is 20 buttons, which includes 4 corners. Then inner is 36 -20=16. So inner buttons are 16. Wait, that contradicts the previous.Wait, maybe there&#39;s confusion between &quot;edges&quot; as non-corner perimeter buttons, or edges as all perimeter buttons.In the problem statement, when they refer to buttons that share a side, they mean adjacent vertically or horizontally. So in a grid, the perimeter is the outermost layer. For a 6x6 grid:- Each side has 6 buttons. But the four corners are each shared by two sides. So total perimeter buttons: 6*4 -4=20. These are all buttons on the edge of the grid, including corners. Therefore, inner buttons:36 -20=16.But in the problem, when we considered toggle counts, we separated corners (as buttons with two neighbors) and edges (buttons with three neighbors). So among the perimeter buttons (20), 4 are corners (two neighbors), and 16 are edges (three neighbors). Wait, 4 corners, each with two neighbors, and 20 -4=16 edge (perimeter) buttons, each with three neighbors. So:- Corner buttons:4, each adjacent to two edge buttons.- Edge buttons (non-corner):16, each adjacent to two corners? Wait, no. Each edge button (non-corner) is on the perimeter but not a corner. For example, on the top row, between the corners (1,1) and (1,6), there are buttons (1,2) to (1,5). Each of these has three neighbors: one above (but they&#39;re on the edge, so no), so actually, each edge button (non-corner) has three neighbors: for example, (1,2) has neighbors (1,1), (1,3), and (2,2). So three neighbors.Similarly, an edge button on the top edge (non-corner) has three neighbors: left, right, and below.Therefore, in the 6x6 grid:- Each corner has two neighbors.- Each edge (non-corner) has three neighbors.- Each inner button (16 in total) has four neighbors.Therefore, when we press each button once:- Each corner is toggled 1 (self) +2 (neighbors) =3 times → on.- Each edge (non-corner) is toggled 1 +3=4 times → off.- Each inner button is toggled 1 +4=5 times → on.Therefore, total on buttons:4 (corners) +16 (inner)=20.But wait, earlier when I thought that inner buttons are 16, but when I considered 6x6 grid minus perimeter (20), inner is 16. But the problem comes when in the 3x3 grid, inner is 1, which is correct.So, in the 6x6 grid:- 4 corners (on).- 16 inner buttons (on).- 20 -4=16 edge (non-corner) buttons (off).Wait, perimeter is 20, subtract 4 corners gives 16 edge non-corner buttons. So total on buttons:4 +16=20.Therefore, answer is 20.But let me confirm once more with another example. Take a 4x4 grid.Corners:4.Edge non-corner: each side has 4-2=2, 4 sides →8. So total perimeter:4 +8=12. Inner buttons:16 -12=4. Wait, 4x4 grid has 16 buttons. Perimeter:4 corners + 8 edges=12. Inner:4.Each corner is toggled 1 +2=3 (on). Each edge non-corner:1 +3=4 (off). Each inner:1 +4=5 (on). So total on:4 +4=8.If we simulate a 4x4 grid, pressing all buttons once, would the result be 8 on buttons? It might take time, but let&#39;s think:Alternatively, since the pattern seems to hold for 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 grids with the formula corners + inner = on buttons, then likely the 6x6 grid would follow.Therefore, the answer is 20.Final Answerboxed{20}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many buttons will be on at the end after pressing each button on a 6 times 6 board exactly once, we analyze the effect of each button press. Each button press toggles the state of the pressed button and its adjacent buttons. Key steps:1. Toggle Count Analysis:   - Each button is pressed once, contributing 1 toggle to itself.   - Each button also toggles its adjacent buttons. The number of adjacent buttons depends on the button&#39;s position:     - Corner buttons (4 in total) have 2 adjacent buttons.     - Edge buttons (non-corner) (16 in total) have 3 adjacent buttons.     - Inner buttons (16 in total) have 4 adjacent buttons.2. Total Toggles:   - Corner buttons: Toggled 1 (self) + 2 (adjacent) = 3 times (odd, so on).   - Edge buttons (non-corner): Toggled 1 (self) + 3 (adjacent) = 4 times (even, so off).   - Inner buttons: Toggled 1 (self) + 4 (adjacent) = 5 times (odd, so on).3. Counting On Buttons:   - Corner buttons: 4 (on).   - Inner buttons: 16 (on).Summing these, the total number of buttons that will be on is 4 + 16 = 20.[boxed{20}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out how many buttons will be on at the end after pressing each button once on a 6x6 grid. The rules are that pressing a button toggles its state and the state of all adjacent (sharing a side) buttons. All start off. Hmm. Let me think step by step.First, let&#39;s understand the problem. Each button press affects the pressed button and its neighbors. Since we start with all off, each press will toggle some buttons. But since each button is pressed exactly once, each button&#39;s state will be affected by the number of times it&#39;s toggled. Each toggle changes the state, so if a button is toggled an odd number of times, it will end up on; if even, it remains off.Therefore, the key is to determine how many times each button is toggled. Since each press affects the pressed button and its neighbors, each button&#39;s toggle count is equal to the number of times it was pressed plus the number of times its neighbors were pressed. But since every button is pressed exactly once, each button will be toggled once (from its own press) plus the number of times its neighbors were pressed (each neighbor pressing toggles it once). Therefore, the total number of toggles for a button is 1 + number of adjacent presses.But wait, each neighbor pressing affects this button. So if a button has, say, four neighbors (like a center button), then each of those neighbors pressing it will toggle it once. So the total toggles are 1 (own press) + number of adjacent presses (each adjacent button is pressed once). But each adjacent button is pressed once, so each neighbor contributes one toggle. So for a corner button, which has two neighbors, the total toggles would be 1 (own press) + 2 (neighbors) = 3. For an edge button (not corner), three neighbors: 1 + 3 = 4. For a center button, four neighbors: 1 + 4 = 5.But wait, each time a neighbor is pressed, the button in question is toggled. So if the button is pressed once (which affects itself and its neighbors), and each neighbor is pressed once (which affects their own neighbors, including the original button). So each button is toggled once for its own press, and once for each neighbor&#39;s press. So the total number of toggles for each button is 1 + number of neighbors. But the number of neighbors depends on the position:- Corner buttons have 2 neighbors.- Edge (non-corner) buttons have 3 neighbors.- Inner buttons (not on edge) have 4 neighbors.But since all buttons are pressed once, the total toggles for each button is 1 + the number of neighbors it has. But wait, that&#39;s not exactly right. Let me correct.Wait, when you press a button, you toggle it and its neighbors. So pressing button A affects A and its neighbors. Pressing button B (a neighbor of A) affects B and its neighbors, including A. So each time a neighbor is pressed, the original button is toggled again. Therefore, for any given button, the number of times it is toggled is equal to 1 (from its own press) plus the number of its neighbors (since each neighbor pressed once toggles it once). So for example, a corner button has 2 neighbors, so toggled 1 + 2 = 3 times. An edge button (non-corner) has 3 neighbors, so toggled 1 + 3 = 4 times. An inner button has 4 neighbors, so toggled 1 + 4 = 5 times.Therefore, the parity (even or odd) of the number of toggles determines if the button is on or off. Since starting from off, an odd number of toggles turns it on, even turns it off. So corner buttons (3 toggles) will be on, edge buttons (4 toggles) will be off, inner buttons (5 toggles) will be on.Wait, so corners and inner buttons will be on, edges (including edges but not corners) will be off. Let&#39;s check:Corners: 3 toggles (odd) → on.Edge (non-corner): 4 toggles (even) → off.Inner: 5 toggles (odd) → on.So how many corners are there? On a 6x6 grid, there are 4 corners. How many edge (non-corner) buttons? Each side has 6 buttons, subtract 2 corners: 4 per side. There are 4 sides, so 4*4=16 edge non-corner buttons. Then inner buttons: total buttons 36, minus 4 corners, minus 16 edges = 16 inner buttons. Wait, 36 -4 -16=16. Wait, 4 corners, 16 edges, 16 inner. So 16 inner buttons. Each inner button is toggled 5 times (on), edges 4 (off), corners 3 (on). So total number of buttons on would be 4 (corners) + 16 (inner) = 20.But wait, is this correct? Let me verify.Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the neighbor count. Let&#39;s see. For each button, number of neighbors is:- Corner: 2 neighbors.- Edge (non-corner): 3 neighbors.- Inner: 4 neighbors.But when we press each button once, the number of toggles a particular button experiences is 1 (from itself) plus the number of neighbors (since each neighbor pressing toggles it once). So yes, for corner: 1 + 2 = 3, edge: 1 + 3 = 4, inner: 1 + 4 = 5. So parity odd, even, odd.Therefore, corners (3) and inner (5) are odd, so on; edges (4) even, off.So number of corners: 4.Number of inner buttons: Let&#39;s see. On a 6x6 grid, the inner buttons would be those not on the border. The borders are the first and sixth rows and columns. So the inner grid is from rows 2-5 and columns 2-5. So that&#39;s 4x4=16 inner buttons.Therefore, total buttons on: 4 + 16 = 20.Therefore, the answer is 20.But wait, let me test this logic with a smaller grid. For example, a 2x2 grid. All buttons pressed once. Each button is a corner. Each has 2 neighbors. So each button is toggled 1 + 2 = 3 times. So all 4 buttons would be on? But let&#39;s simulate.In a 2x2 grid:Start all off: [0,0;0,0]Press (1,1): toggles (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Now [1,1;1,0]Press (1,2): toggles (1,2), (1,1), (2,2). Now [0,0;1,1]Press (2,1): toggles (2,1), (1,1), (2,2). Now [1,1;0,0]Press (2,2): toggles (2,2), (2,1), (1,2). Now [1,0;0,1]Wait, final state: [1,0;0,1]. So two buttons on. But according to our previous logic, all four corners (but 2x2 grid only has four buttons, all corners). Each would have 2 neighbors, so toggles 3 times. So should all be on. But simulation shows only two are on. Therefore, our logic is flawed.Hmm, so there&#39;s a mistake here. So the problem is that when considering each button&#39;s toggle count as 1 + number of neighbors, but in reality, when pressing a neighbor, it&#39;s not just the neighbor&#39;s press that affects the original button, but the original button&#39;s press also affects the neighbor, but the total count is still 1 + number of neighbors. Wait, in the 2x2 grid, according to that logic, each button would be pressed once, and each has two neighbors. So each button is toggled 3 times. But in the simulation, it&#39;s only two buttons on. So this is a contradiction.Therefore, my previous reasoning must be wrong. Let me think again.Each button is pressed once, so each button is toggled once by itself. Then, each neighbor&#39;s press toggles it once. So for a 2x2 grid, each button has two neighbors. So each button is toggled 1 + 2 = 3 times. So each should end up on. But in reality, the simulation shows only two on. Therefore, my reasoning is incorrect. What&#39;s the mistake?Wait, maybe in the 2x2 grid, pressing a button toggles itself and its neighbors. Let&#39;s do step by step:Start: all off.Press (1,1):- Toggle (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Now (1,1)=on, (1,2)=on, (2,1)=on.Press (1,2):- Toggle (1,2), (1,1), (2,2). (1,2) was on, now off. (1,1) was on, now off. (2,2) was off, now on. So now (1,1)=off, (1,2)=off, (2,1)=on, (2,2)=on.Press (2,1):- Toggle (2,1), (1,1), (2,2). (2,1)=on→off. (1,1)=off→on. (2,2)=on→off. Now (1,1)=on, (2,1)=off, (2,2)=off.Press (2,2):- Toggle (2,2), (2,1), (1,2). (2,2)=off→on. (2,1)=off→on. (1,2)=off→on. Final state: (1,1)=on, (1,2)=on, (2,1)=on, (2,2)=on. Wait, that&#39;s all on? Wait, that contradicts my previous simulation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation steps.Wait let&#39;s do it again:Start: all off.1. Press (1,1):   - (1,1) toggles: on   - (1,2) toggles: on   - (2,1) toggles: on   State:   [1,1]   [1,0]2. Press (1,2):   - (1,2) toggles: off   - (1,1) toggles: off   - (2,2) toggles: on   State:   [0,0]   [1,1]3. Press (2,1):   - (2,1) toggles: off   - (1,1) toggles: on   - (2,2) toggles: off   State:   [1,0]   [0,0]4. Press (2,2):   - (2,2) toggles: on   - (2,1) toggles: on   - (1,2) toggles: on   State:   [1,1]   [1,1]Wait, so after all presses, all are on. So that actually matches the initial reasoning: each button is toggled 3 times (1 + 2 neighbors), so odd number, thus all on. So my previous simulation was wrong. So maybe my original reasoning is correct.Therefore, returning to the 6x6 grid, corners (3 toggles) and inner buttons (5 toggles) are on, edges (4 toggles) are off. So total on: 4 + 16 = 20.But let&#39;s test another grid. Let&#39;s take 3x3 grid. According to the reasoning:Corners: 4 corners, each toggled 3 times (on).Edges (non-corner): 4 edges, each toggled 4 times (off).Center: 1 button, toggled 5 times (on).Total on: 4 + 1 = 5.Let&#39;s simulate.3x3 grid, all off.Press each button once. Let&#39;s see the final state.But simulating all 9 steps is tedious, but perhaps there&#39;s a pattern. Alternatively, since each button is pressed once, so each is toggled 1 + number of neighbors. For 3x3:Corners: 1 + 2 = 3 (on).Edges: 1 + 3 = 4 (off).Center: 1 + 4 = 5 (on).Total on: 4 + 1 = 5.Alternatively, let&#39;s try to compute the toggles for each cell:Each cell (i,j) is toggled once for itself, once for each neighbor.But in a 3x3 grid, the center (2,2) has 4 neighbors. So 5 toggles.Corners (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) each have 2 neighbors. So 3 toggles.Edges (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) each have 3 neighbors. So 4 toggles.Thus, center and corners on, edges off. So 5 buttons on.If we simulate pressing all buttons once, perhaps the result is 5. Let me try:But this would take time. Maybe trust the pattern.So, given that the 2x2 grid ends up all on (4 buttons on), which matches the reasoning (each toggled 3 times). The 3x3 grid ends with 5 on. So the pattern for N x N grid:- Corners: 4 buttons, toggled 3 times (on if N &gt;=2 )- Edges (non-corner): 4(N-2) buttons, toggled 4 times (off)- Inner: (N-2)^2 buttons, toggled 5 times (on)But wait, for N=6:Corners: 4 buttons (toggled 3 times: on)Edges (non-corner): Each side has 6 buttons, minus 2 corners: 4 per side. 4 sides: 16 buttons (toggled 4 times: off)Inner: (6-2)x(6-2)=4x4=16 buttons (toggled 5 times: on)Total on: 4 + 16 = 20.Therefore, the answer is 20.But to confirm, perhaps consider the parity of the toggle counts.Alternatively, model this as linear algebra over GF(2), where each button press corresponds to a vector, and the total effect is the sum of all vectors. However, this might be complex for a 6x6 grid, but maybe there&#39;s a pattern.However, considering that each button is pressed once, the total number of times each button is toggled is 1 + number of neighbors. Since each neighbor press affects it once. Therefore, the parity is 1 + number of neighbors mod 2. So for each button:If 1 + number of neighbors is odd, then the button is on.Number of neighbors:- Corner: 2 neighbors. 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 1 mod 2 → on.- Edge (non-corner): 3 neighbors. 1 + 3 = 4 ≡ 0 mod 2 → off.- Inner: 4 neighbors. 1 + 4 = 5 ≡ 1 mod 2 → on.Therefore, same conclusion: corners and inner on, edges off.Therefore, total on: 4 + 16 = 20.Hence, the answer is 20.Final Answerboxed{20}&lt;/think&gt;To determine how many buttons will be on at the end after pressing each button once on a 6x6 grid, we need to consider the number of times each button is toggled. Each button press toggles the pressed button and its adjacent buttons. Starting with all buttons off, a button will end up on if it is toggled an odd number of times.1. Toggle Count Analysis:   - Corner Buttons: Each corner button has 2 adjacent neighbors. Pressing it toggles it once, and each neighbor press toggles it once. Total toggles = 1 (own press) + 2 (neighbors) = 3 (odd).   - Edge Buttons (non-corner): Each edge button has 3 adjacent neighbors. Total toggles = 1 (own press) + 3 (neighbors) = 4 (even).   - Inner Buttons: Each inner button has 4 adjacent neighbors. Total toggles = 1 (own press) + 4 (neighbors) = 5 (odd).2. Button Count:   - Corner Buttons: There are 4 corners on a 6x6 grid.   - Edge Buttons (non-corner): Each side has 4 non-corner edge buttons, totaling 16.   - Inner Buttons: The inner grid is a 4x4 grid, totaling 16.3. Result:   - Corner buttons (4) and inner buttons (16) are toggled an odd number of times, so they will be on.   - Edge buttons (16) are toggled an even number of times, so they will be off.Thus, the total number of buttons that will be on is (4 + 16 = 20).[boxed{20}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-4f6c926b></div><p class="review-content" data-v-4f6c926b><span class="icon" data-v-4f6c926b>🔑:</span>SolutionNotice that a button will end up lit if it changes state an odd number of times and will end up off otherwise. Each button changes state when it or one of its neighbors is pressed, so the number of times it will change state will be equal to its number of neighbors plus one. We can thus analyze each cell of the board according to its number of neighbors:i) The four corner cells each have two neighbors and will thus change state 1+ 2=3 times. They will end up lit.ii) The cells that are on the sides but are not corners have three neighbors and will thus change state 1+3=4 times. They will end up off.iii) Each of the other cells that are not on the sides have four neighbors and will thus change state 1+4=5 times. They will end up lit.Finally, since the 6 times 6 board has 16 side cells that are not corners and these are the only ones that will end up off, we conclude that 36-16=20 buttons will be lit at the end of the process.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-4ff500d3><span data-v-4ff500d3>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
