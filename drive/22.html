So, the question is: The areas of three squares are 16, 49, and 169. What is the average (mean) of their side lengths? The options are A) 8, B) 12, C) 24, D) 39, E) 32.First, I need to recall that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, if the area is given, the side length would be the square root of the area. That makes sense. So, for each of these areas, I can find the side length by taking the square root of each area.Let me write that down. The three areas are 16, 49, and 169. Let&#39;s find each side length:1. First square: Area = 16. So, side length = √16. Hmm, √16 is 4, because 4 squared is 16.2. Second square: Area = 49. Side length = √49. That&#39;s 7, since 7 squared is 49.3. Third square: Area = 169. Side length = √169. Let me think... 13 squared is 169, so that&#39;s 13.Okay, so the side lengths are 4, 7, and 13. Now, the question asks for the average (mean) of these side lengths. To find the mean, I need to add up all the side lengths and then divide by the number of squares, which is 3.Let&#39;s add them up: 4 + 7 + 13. Let me do that step by step. 4 + 7 is 11, and 11 + 13 is 24. So the total sum of the side lengths is 24.Now, to find the average, divide this sum by 3. So, 24 ÷ 3. Hmm, 24 divided by 3 is 8. Wait, 3 times 8 is 24, so yes, that&#39;s correct. So the average of the side lengths is 8.Looking back at the options, option A is 8. So, the answer should be A) 8. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn&#39;t make a mistake.First, square roots of the areas: 16 becomes 4, 49 becomes 7, 169 becomes 13. Correct. Then sum them: 4 + 7 + 13. That&#39;s 24. Divided by 3 gives 8. Yep, that&#39;s right. The answer is A.But hold on, let me check the problem again to ensure I didn&#39;t misread anything. The question says &quot;the average of their side lengths.&quot; The areas are given, and we converted each area to a side length correctly. Then added those lengths and divided by 3. All steps seem okay.Alternatively, maybe someone could think about averaging the areas first and then taking the square root, but that would be incorrect. Because the average of the areas would be (16 + 49 + 169)/3 = (234)/3 = 78. Then the square root of 78 is not an integer, but the answer choices are all integers, so that approach is wrong. So, definitely, the correct way is to average the side lengths, not the areas. So, my approach was correct.Therefore, the answer is A) 8.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;The areas of three squares are given as 16, 49, and 169. To find the average of their side lengths, we first determine the side length of each square by taking the square root of each area:1. The side length of the square with area 16 is (sqrt{16} = 4).2. The side length of the square with area 49 is (sqrt{49} = 7).3. The side length of the square with area 169 is (sqrt{169} = 13).Next, we calculate the sum of these side lengths:[4 + 7 + 13 = 24]To find the average (mean) of the side lengths, we divide the sum by the number of squares (3):[frac{24}{3} = 8]Thus, the average of the side lengths is (boxed{A}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the average of the side lengths of three squares whose areas are 16, 49, and 169. Hmm, let&#39;s start by recalling how the area of a square relates to its side length. The area is the side length squared, right? So if the area is given, the side length must be the square root of the area. That makes sense.First, let me write down the areas: 16, 49, and 169. To find each side length, I need to take the square root of each of these numbers. Let me do that one by one.Starting with the first area, which is 16. The square root of 16 is 4, because 4 times 4 equals 16. So the side length of the first square is 4 units. Next, the area is 49. The square root of 49 is 7, since 7 multiplied by 7 is 49. Therefore, the side length of the second square is 7 units.The third area is 169. Hmm, what&#39;s the square root of 169? Let me think. 13 times 13 is 169. Yes, that&#39;s right. So the side length of the third square is 13 units.Okay, now I have the three side lengths: 4, 7, and 13. The problem asks for the average (mean) of these side lengths. To find the mean, I need to add all the side lengths together and then divide by the number of squares, which is 3.Let me add them up: 4 + 7 + 13. Let&#39;s compute that step by step. 4 plus 7 is 11, and then 11 plus 13 is 24. So the total sum of the side lengths is 24. Now, to find the average, I divide this sum by 3. So, 24 divided by 3 equals 8. Wait, 24 divided by 3 is indeed 8. So the average of the side lengths is 8. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn&#39;t make any mistakes. First, square roots: sqrt(16)=4, sqrt(49)=7, sqrt(169)=13. Correct. Then adding them: 4 + 7 = 11, 11 +13=24. Then 24 divided by 3 is 8. Yes, that seems right. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 8. So that must be the correct answer. Let me just verify once more in case I miscalculated the square roots or the addition. 16 is 4 squared, 49 is 7 squared, 169 is 13 squared. Adding 4,7,13: 4+7=11, 11+13=24. Average is 24/3=8. Yep, all steps check out. I think that&#39;s solid. The answer should be 8, which is option A.Final Answerboxed{A}&lt;/think&gt;To find the average of the side lengths of three squares with areas 16, 49, and 169, we first determine the side lengths by taking the square root of each area:- The side length of the square with area 16 is (sqrt{16} = 4).- The side length of the square with area 49 is (sqrt{49} = 7).- The side length of the square with area 169 is (sqrt{169} = 13).Next, we find the sum of these side lengths:[4 + 7 + 13 = 24]To calculate the average, we divide the total sum by the number of squares (3):[frac{24}{3} = 8]Thus, the average of the side lengths is (boxed{A}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-276ea2c2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>🔑:</span>Since the areas of the three squares are 16,49 and 169 , then their side lengths are sqrt{16}=4, sqrt{49}=7 and sqrt{169}=13, respectively.Thus, the average of their side lengths is frac{4+7+13}{3}=8.ANSWER: (A)</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2fed70db data-v-276ea2c2><div class="review" data-v-276ea2c2><div class="review-title" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>❓:</span>Given the functions f(x)=x^{3}-9x and g(x)=3x^{2}+a.(I) The line l is the tangent line to the curve y=f(x) at the point (0,f(0)), and l is also tangent to the curve y=g(x).

So, we have two functions: f(x) = x³ - 9x and g(x) = 3x² + a. The problem says that the line l is the tangent to the curve y = f(x) at the point (0, f(0)), and this same line l is also tangent to the curve y = g(x). We need to find the value of a.First, let me recall what a tangent line is. A tangent line to a curve at a point is a line that just touches the curve at that point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. So, for part (I), I need to find the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at x = 0, and then find the value of a such that this line is also tangent to g(x).Let me start by finding the point (0, f(0)). Plugging x = 0 into f(x):f(0) = 0³ - 9*0 = 0. So the point is (0, 0).Next, find the derivative of f(x) to get the slope of the tangent line at x = 0. The derivative f’(x) is 3x² - 9. Plugging in x = 0:f’(0) = 3*(0)² - 9 = -9. So the slope of the tangent line l at (0,0) is -9.Now, using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the tangent line l is:y - f(0) = f’(0)(x - 0)y - 0 = -9xSo, y = -9x is the equation of line l.Now, this line l must also be tangent to the curve y = g(x) = 3x² + a. So, we need to find a value of a such that the line y = -9x is tangent to g(x).To find when a line is tangent to a parabola, we can set the equations equal and ensure that the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation is zero (since a tangent intersects the curve exactly once).Set -9x = 3x² + a. Rearranging:3x² + 9x + a = 0This is a quadratic equation in x. For this quadratic to have exactly one solution (i.e., the line is tangent), the discriminant must be zero.The discriminant D of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is D = b² - 4ac. In this case, a = 3, b = 9, c = a.So, D = 9² - 4*3*a = 81 - 12a. Setting D = 0:81 - 12a = 012a = 81a = 81 / 12Simplify this fraction: 81 divided by 12. Both are divisible by 3.81 ÷ 3 = 2712 ÷ 3 = 4So, a = 27/4But wait, 27/4 is 6.75. Let me check the calculations again.Set the line y = -9x tangent to y = 3x² + a. So, equate them:-9x = 3x² + a3x² + 9x + a = 0Discriminant D = 9² - 4*3*a = 81 - 12a. Set D = 0:81 - 12a = 0 =&gt; 12a = 81 =&gt; a = 81/12 = 27/4. That&#39;s 6.75. So, yes, that seems right. So, part (I) answer is a = 27/4.Wait, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, the line y = -9x is tangent to g(x) at some point (p, g(p)). Then, the slope of the tangent line at that point must be equal to the slope of the line, which is -9.So, the derivative of g(x) is g’(x) = 6x. So, at the point of tangency x = p, we have:g’(p) = 6p = -9 =&gt; p = -9/6 = -3/2.So, the point of tangency on g(x) is at x = -3/2. Let&#39;s find the y-coordinate on the line: y = -9*(-3/2) = 27/2. Also, the y-coordinate on g(x) at x = -3/2 is:g(-3/2) = 3*(-3/2)² + a = 3*(9/4) + a = 27/4 + a.Since both the line and the curve pass through this point, we have:27/2 = 27/4 + aSolving for a:a = 27/2 - 27/4 = (54/4 - 27/4) = 27/4.So, this confirms that a = 27/4. Therefore, part (I) is 27/4. So that&#39;s correct.Now, part (II): If the equation f(x) = g(x) has three distinct real solutions, find the range of real values for a.So, f(x) = x³ - 9x and g(x) = 3x² + a. So, setting them equal:x³ - 9x = 3x² + aBring all terms to one side:x³ - 3x² - 9x - a = 0Let me denote h(x) = x³ - 3x² - 9x - a. We need h(x) = 0 to have three distinct real roots. For a cubic equation to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive. Alternatively, we can analyze the function h(x) and find the conditions on a such that the graph crosses the x-axis three times.First, let&#39;s find the critical points of h(x). The critical points occur where h’(x) = 0.Compute h’(x):h’(x) = 3x² - 6x - 9Set h’(x) = 0:3x² - 6x - 9 = 0Divide both sides by 3:x² - 2x - 3 = 0Factor:(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0So, critical points at x = 3 and x = -1.Now, to determine the nature of these critical points (maxima or minima), we can compute the second derivative:h&#39;&#39;(x) = 6x - 6At x = 3: h&#39;&#39;(3) = 6*3 - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12 &gt; 0, so x=3 is a local minimum.At x = -1: h&#39;&#39;(-1) = 6*(-1) - 6 = -6 -6 = -12 &lt; 0, so x=-1 is a local maximum.So, the function h(x) has a local maximum at x = -1 and a local minimum at x = 3. For the cubic equation h(x) = 0 to have three distinct real roots, the value of h at the local maximum must be greater than zero, and the value at the local minimum must be less than zero. That way, the graph crosses the x-axis three times: once before the local maximum, once between the local maximum and local minimum, and once after the local minimum.Alternatively, the conditions are h(-1) &gt; 0 and h(3) &lt; 0.Wait, actually, since the leading coefficient of h(x) is positive (1 for x³ term), the cubic tends to +infinity as x approaches +infinity and -infinity as x approaches -infinity. Therefore, to have three real roots, the local maximum must be above the x-axis and the local minimum must be below the x-axis. Therefore, h(-1) &gt; 0 and h(3) &lt; 0.So, compute h(-1):h(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3*(-1)^2 - 9*(-1) - a = -1 - 3*1 + 9 - a = -1 - 3 + 9 - a = 5 - aSimilarly, h(3):h(3) = (3)^3 - 3*(3)^2 - 9*(3) - a = 27 - 27 - 27 - a = -27 - aSo, the conditions are:1. h(-1) &gt; 0: 5 - a &gt; 0 =&gt; a &lt; 52. h(3) &lt; 0: -27 - a &lt; 0 =&gt; -a &lt; 27 =&gt; a &gt; -27Therefore, combining these two inequalities:-27 &lt; a &lt; 5So, the range of a is from -27 to 5, not including the endpoints.Wait, let me check the calculations again.For h(-1):(-1)^3 is -1.-3*(-1)^2: -3*(1) = -3.-9*(-1) = 9.So, total: -1 -3 +9 -a = 5 -a. Correct.For h(3):3^3 is 27.-3*(3)^2: -3*9 = -27.-9*(3) = -27.So, 27 -27 -27 -a = -27 -a. Correct.Therefore, the conditions are 5 -a &gt;0 =&gt; a &lt;5 and -27 -a &lt;0 =&gt; -a &lt;27 =&gt; a &gt; -27. So, -27 &lt; a &lt;5. Therefore, the range of a is (-27, 5).But let me confirm with another method. Suppose we consider the equation f(x) = g(x), which is x³ -9x = 3x² + a. Rearranged: x³ -3x² -9x -a =0.To have three distinct real roots, the cubic must have a local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis, which we already found. Hence, the answer is that a must be between -27 and 5.Alternatively, if we set up the equation h(x) = x³ -3x² -9x -a, then the number of real roots is determined by the parameter a. The cubic will have three real roots when the horizontal line y = a intersects the cubic h(x) = x³ -3x² -9x at three distinct points. Therefore, the range of a is between the local maximum and local minimum of the cubic h(x) without the constant term. Wait, but here h(x) is x³ -3x² -9x -a. So, actually, h(x) can be written as (x³ -3x² -9x) -a. So, the equation h(x) =0 is equivalent to a = x³ -3x² -9x. Therefore, the number of real solutions is determined by how the horizontal line a intersects the graph of the function k(x) = x³ -3x² -9x.Therefore, to have three distinct real solutions, the horizontal line a must intersect k(x) three times. The extrema of k(x) are the same as h(x) since k(x) is h(x) + a. So, the critical points of k(x) are at x = -1 and x =3. Then, compute k(-1) and k(3):k(-1) = (-1)^3 -3*(-1)^2 -9*(-1) = -1 -3 +9 =5k(3) = 3^3 -3*(3)^2 -9*(3) =27 -27 -27 = -27Therefore, the graph of k(x) has a local maximum at x=-1 with value 5 and a local minimum at x=3 with value -27. Since the cubic tends to +infinity as x approaches +infinity and -infinity as x approaches -infinity, the graph will cross the horizontal line a three times if a is between the local maximum and local minimum. Therefore, when a is between -27 and 5, the equation a =k(x) has three distinct real solutions. Hence, the range is -27 &lt; a &lt;5.Therefore, part (II) answer is (-27,5), so in boxed notation, boxed{(-27, 5)}.Let me just recap part (I) again. We found that the tangent line at (0,0) is y=-9x. Then, set this equal to g(x) =3x² +a, leading to 3x² +9x +a=0. Discriminant is 81 -12a=0, so a=81/12=27/4=6.75. Then, using another method by finding the point of tangency on g(x), we got the same answer, so that seems solid.So, summarizing:(I) a = 27/4(II) -27 &lt; a &lt;5Final Answer(I) boxed{dfrac{27}{4}}  (II) boxed{(-27, 5)}&lt;/think&gt;(I) To find the value of (a) such that the line (l) is tangent to both (y = f(x)) at ((0, f(0))) and (y = g(x)):1. Calculate (f(0)):   [   f(0) = 0^3 - 9 cdot 0 = 0   ]   The point is ((0, 0)).2. Find the derivative (f&#39;(x)):   [   f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 9   ]   The slope at (x = 0) is:   [   f&#39;(0) = -9   ]   The equation of the tangent line (l) is:   [   y = -9x   ]3. Set the line (y = -9x) equal to (g(x)):   [   -9x = 3x^2 + a   ]   Rearrange to:   [   3x^2 + 9x + a = 0   ]4. For the line to be tangent, the discriminant must be zero:   [   81 - 12a = 0 implies a = frac{81}{12} = frac{27}{4}   ]Thus, the value of (a) is (boxed{dfrac{27}{4}}).(II) To find the range of (a) such that (f(x) = g(x)) has three distinct real solutions:1. Set (f(x) = g(x)):   [   x^3 - 9x = 3x^2 + a   ]   Rearrange to:   [   x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x - a = 0   ]2. Find the critical points of (h(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x - a):   [   h&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 6x - 9   ]   Solving (h&#39;(x) = 0):   [   x = 3 text{ (local minimum)}, quad x = -1 text{ (local maximum)}   ]3. Evaluate (h(x)) at these critical points:   [   h(-1) = 5 - a quad text{and} quad h(3) = -27 - a   ]4. For three distinct real roots, the local maximum must be positive and the local minimum must be negative:   [   5 - a &gt; 0 implies a &lt; 5   ]   [   -27 - a &lt; 0 implies a &gt; -27   ]Thus, the range of (a) is (boxed{(-27, 5)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. First, part (I). We have two functions: f(x) = x³ - 9x and g(x) = 3x² + a. The line l is the tangent to the curve y = f(x) at the point (0, f(0)), and this same line is also tangent to the curve y = g(x). We need to find the value of a.Starting with part (I). Let&#39;s first find the point (0, f(0)). Plugging x = 0 into f(x), we get f(0) = 0³ - 9*0 = 0. So the point is (0, 0). Now, to find the equation of the tangent line at this point, we need the derivative of f(x) at x = 0.The derivative f&#39;(x) = 3x² - 9. So f&#39;(0) = 3*(0)² - 9 = -9. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at (0, 0) is -9. Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point. Here, that would be y - 0 = -9(x - 0), so y = -9x. So the equation of the tangent line l is y = -9x.Now, this line is also tangent to the curve y = g(x) = 3x² + a. For the line y = -9x to be tangent to the parabola y = 3x² + a, the system of equations must have exactly one solution. That is, solving -9x = 3x² + a should result in a quadratic equation with a discriminant equal to zero. Let&#39;s set them equal:3x² + a = -9x  3x² + 9x + a = 0This is a quadratic in x. For there to be exactly one real solution, the discriminant D must be zero. The discriminant of ax² + bx + c is D = b² - 4ac. Here, a = 3, b = 9, c = a (careful, same symbol as the coefficient a). So:D = 9² - 4*3*a = 81 - 12aSet D = 0:81 - 12a = 0  12a = 81  a = 81 / 12  Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 27 / 4. So a = 27/4.Wait, let me check that again. 81 divided by 12 is 6.75, and 27/4 is 6.75, yes. So a = 27/4. That seems straightforward. But let me just verify.Alternatively, since the line is tangent to the parabola, another way is to find the point where the derivative of g(x) equals the slope of the line. The slope of the line is -9. The derivative of g(x) is g&#39;(x) = 6x. So set 6x = -9, which gives x = -9/6 = -3/2. Then, substitute x = -3/2 into both the line equation and the parabola equation to ensure they are equal.First, the line y = -9x at x = -3/2: y = -9*(-3/2) = 27/2.The parabola y = 3x² + a at x = -3/2: y = 3*(9/4) + a = 27/4 + a.Set them equal: 27/2 = 27/4 + a. Subtract 27/4 from both sides:27/2 - 27/4 = a  Convert to common denominator: 54/4 - 27/4 = 27/4  Thus, a = 27/4. Same result. So that&#39;s confirmed. So part (I) answer is 27/4. Alright, that seems solid.Moving on to part (II): If the equation f(x) = g(x) has three distinct real solutions, find the range of real values for a.So f(x) = g(x) implies x³ - 9x = 3x² + a. Let&#39;s rearrange this equation:x³ - 9x - 3x² - a = 0  x³ - 3x² - 9x - a = 0.We need this cubic equation to have three distinct real roots. For a cubic equation to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive. Alternatively, we can analyze the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x) = x³ - 3x² - 9x - a and find the conditions on a such that h(x) has three distinct real roots. Since h(x) is a cubic, it tends to infinity as x approaches infinity and negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, so it must have at least one real root. To have three distinct real roots, the function must have a local maximum and a local minimum, and the values of these extrema must straddle the x-axis; that is, the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative (or vice versa, but given the leading coefficient is positive, it&#39;s the former). So we need to find the critical points of h(x), compute the values of h at those points, and set up the inequalities that the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative. Then solve for a.Let&#39;s compute the derivative h&#39;(x):h&#39;(x) = 3x² - 6x - 9.Set h&#39;(x) = 0 to find critical points:3x² - 6x - 9 = 0  Divide both sides by 3: x² - 2x - 3 = 0  Factor: (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0  Thus, x = 3 and x = -1.So the critical points are at x = -1 and x = 3. Now, compute h(-1) and h(3):First, h(-1) = (-1)³ - 3*(-1)² - 9*(-1) - a  = -1 - 3*1 + 9 - a  = -1 - 3 + 9 - a  = 5 - a.Then, h(3) = (3)³ - 3*(3)² - 9*(3) - a  = 27 - 27 - 27 - a  = -27 - a.So h(-1) = 5 - a and h(3) = -27 - a. For the cubic to have three distinct real roots, the function must cross the x-axis three times. Given the leading term is x³, the graph comes from negative infinity, goes up to the local maximum at x = -1, then down to the local minimum at x = 3, then up to positive infinity. Therefore, for three real roots, the local maximum at x = -1 must be above the x-axis (h(-1) &gt; 0) and the local minimum at x = 3 must be below the x-axis (h(3) &lt; 0). So:5 - a &gt; 0 =&gt; a &lt; 5  -27 - a &lt; 0 =&gt; a &gt; -27Therefore, combining these inequalities: -27 &lt; a &lt; 5.Hence, the range of real values for a is (-27, 5). Let me check if this makes sense.Alternatively, the cubic will have three real roots if and only if the discriminant is positive. The discriminant of a cubic equation ax³ + bx² + cx + d is given by Δ = 18abcd - 4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d². For our cubic h(x) = x³ - 3x² - 9x - a, the coefficients are:a_coeff = 1, b = -3, c = -9, d = -a.Plugging into the discriminant formula:Δ = 18*(1)*(-3)*(-9)*(-a) - 4*(-3)^3*(-a) + (-3)^2*(-9)^2 - 4*(1)*(-9)^3 - 27*(1)^2*(-a)^2This looks complicated, but let&#39;s compute step by step:First term: 18*1*(-3)*(-9)*(-a) = 18*27*(-a) = 486*(-a) = -486aSecond term: -4*(-3)^3*(-a) = -4*(-27)*(-a) = -4*27*a = -108aThird term: (-3)^2*(-9)^2 = 9*81 = 729Fourth term: -4*(1)*(-9)^3 = -4*(-729) = 2916Fifth term: -27*(1)^2*(-a)^2 = -27*a²So summing all terms:Δ = (-486a) + (-108a) + 729 + 2916 + (-27a²)Combine like terms:Δ = (-486a - 108a) + (729 + 2916) - 27a²  = (-594a) + 3645 - 27a²  = -27a² -594a + 3645Factor out -27:Δ = -27(a² + 22a - 135)Wait, let me check:-27a² -594a + 3645 = -27(a² + (594/27)a - 3645/27)  Simplify 594/27: 22, since 27*22 = 594  3645/27: 135, since 27*135 = 3645  Thus, Δ = -27(a² + 22a - 135)For the discriminant to be positive, Δ &gt; 0:-27(a² + 22a - 135) &gt; 0  Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):27(a² + 22a - 135) &lt; 0  Divide both sides by 27:a² + 22a - 135 &lt; 0Now, solve the quadratic inequality a² + 22a - 135 &lt; 0.First, find roots of a² + 22a - 135 = 0:Using quadratic formula:a = [-22 ± sqrt(22² - 4*1*(-135))]/2  = [-22 ± sqrt(484 + 540)]/2  = [-22 ± sqrt(1024)]/2  = [-22 ± 32]/2So two roots:a = (-22 + 32)/2 = 10/2 = 5  a = (-22 -32)/2 = -54/2 = -27Therefore, the quadratic a² + 22a - 135 factors as (a - 5)(a + 27). Wait, let&#39;s check:(a - 5)(a + 27) = a² +27a -5a -135 = a² +22a -135. Yes, correct.So the inequality (a - 5)(a + 27) &lt; 0. The product is negative when one factor is positive and the other is negative. Since the parabola opens upwards (coefficient of a² is positive), the inequality a² +22a -135 &lt;0 holds between the roots: -27 &lt; a &lt; 5. Which matches our previous result. Therefore, the discriminant is positive when -27 &lt; a &lt; 5. Therefore, the equation f(x) = g(x) has three distinct real roots when a is in (-27, 5). So part (II) answer is that the range of a is -27 &lt; a &lt; 5.Wait, let me cross-verify this with the previous method. If we require that the local maximum h(-1) = 5 - a is positive (so a &lt; 5) and the local minimum h(3) = -27 -a is negative (so a &gt; -27). Thus, combining gives -27 &lt; a &lt; 5. Exactly the same result. So that&#39;s confirmed. So both methods give the same answer. Therefore, part (II) answer is (-27, 5).Hence, the final answers are:(I) a = 27/4(II) The range of a is -27 &lt; a &lt; 5Final Answer(I) boxed{dfrac{27}{4}}  (II) boxed{(-27, 5)}&lt;/think&gt;Given the functions ( f(x) = x^3 - 9x ) and ( g(x) = 3x^2 + a ):(I) The line ( l ) is the tangent line to the curve ( y = f(x) ) at the point ( (0, f(0)) ), and ( l ) is also tangent to the curve ( y = g(x) ). 1.

Hmm, let&#39;s try to think about how these arrays look and maybe relate them to something I know.First, starting with ( a_1 = 0 ). Then each subsequent term differs by exactly 1. So this seems like a walk on the nonnegative integers starting at 0, where each step is either up by 1 or down by 1. But since we&#39;re dealing with nonnegative integers, we can&#39;t go below 0. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such walks of length ( k ) that never go below 0.Wait, that sounds familiar. Isn&#39;t this related to Dyck paths or Catalan numbers? But Catalan numbers count the number of Dyck paths that don&#39;t go below 0 and return to 0. However, in our case, we don&#39;t necessarily have to return to 0. The array can end at any nonnegative integer. So maybe it&#39;s different.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s related to the number of balanced parentheses. But again, Catalan numbers count specific structures. Let me check for small values of ( k ) to see what the numbers look like.Let&#39;s take ( k = 1 ). Then the array has two elements: ( a_1 = 0 ), ( a_2 ). Since ( |a_1 - a_2| = 1 ), ( a_2 ) must be 1. So only 1 array. But ( dbinom{1}{0} = 1 ), since ( lfloor 1/2 rfloor = 0 ). So that works.For ( k = 2 ), the array has three elements: 0, then can go to 1, then from 1 can go to 0 or 2. But we can&#39;t go below 0. So from 1, if we go down to 0, that&#39;s allowed. If we go up to 2, that&#39;s allowed too. So two possible arrays: [0,1,0] and [0,1,2]. Then ( dbinom{2}{1} = 2 ). That&#39;s correct.For ( k = 3 ). Starting at 0, first step to 1. Then from 1, possible steps to 0 or 2. Let&#39;s track each path:1. 0 → 1 → 0 → ?   - From 0, next step must be 1. So path is 0→1→0→1. So [0,1,0,1].2. 0 → 1 → 2 → ?   - From 2, can go to 1 or 3. So two paths: 0→1→2→1 and 0→1→2→3.So total 3 paths. But ( dbinom{3}{1} = 3 ), since ( lfloor 3/2 rfloor = 1 ). That matches.Wait, but let&#39;s count again. For ( k = 3 ), the arrays are:1. [0,1,0,1]2. [0,1,2,1]3. [0,1,2,3]Yes, three arrays. So the formula holds here.For ( k = 4 ), let&#39;s compute.Starting at 0, step to 1. Then:1. Paths going through 0 after two steps:   - 0→1→0→1→0 or 0→1→0→1→22. Paths staying above 1 after two steps:   - 0→1→2→1→0   - 0→1→2→1→2   - 0→1→2→3→2   - 0→1→2→3→4Wait, let&#39;s break it down step by step.At step 1: 0→1At step 2: From 1, can go to 0 or 2.Case 1: 0→1→0From 0, step 3 must be 1.From 1, step 4 can be 0 or 2.So paths:0→1→0→1→00→1→0→1→2Case 2: 0→1→2From 2, step 3 can be 1 or 3.Subcase 2a: 0→1→2→1From 1, step 4 can be 0 or 2.So paths:0→1→2→1→00→1→2→1→2Subcase 2b: 0→1→2→3From 3, step 4 can be 2 or 4.So paths:0→1→2→3→20→1→2→3→4Total paths: 6. But ( dbinom{4}{2} = 6 ). Which matches. So, formula holds here.So for ( k = 1,2,3,4 ), the numbers check out as 1, 2, 3, 6, which are the binomial coefficients ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Therefore, the formula seems to hold. So how can we prove it?First, note that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of walks starting at 0, taking ( k ) steps of ±1, and never going below 0. So we need to count such walks. The number of such walks is given by the Catalan numbers only if the walk returns to 0, but in our case, the walk can end anywhere.Wait, but Catalan numbers count Dyck paths, which are walks of even length returning to 0. However, here, walks can end at any height, as long as they never go below 0. So perhaps the number of such walks is given by the binomial coefficient ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s the central binomial coefficient? Wait, the central binomial coefficient is ( dbinom{2n}{n} ), but here it&#39;s ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), which for even k is ( dbinom{k}{k/2} ), and for odd k, it&#39;s ( dbinom{k}{(k-1)/2} ). Hmm. Wait, in the examples above:For k=1: ( dbinom{1}{0} =1 )For k=2: ( dbinom{2}{1}=2 )For k=3: ( dbinom{3}{1}=3 )For k=4: ( dbinom{4}{2}=6 )Yes, so that&#39;s exactly the central binomial coefficients when k is even, and something else when k is odd. Wait, but perhaps the formula is more general. Let&#39;s see, for example, k=5.k=5: How many walks?But maybe instead of enumerating, think of reflection principle or some combinatorial argument.Alternatively, consider that each step is either up or down, but cannot go below 0. So this is similar to the Ballot problem, where we count the number of ways one candidate stays ahead of another.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a combination of steps, with some constraints.Alternatively, the number of such walks is the number of sequences of k steps (each +1 or -1) starting at 0, never going below 0. The total number of such walks is known to be the number of Dyck paths if we return to 0, but here we don&#39;t have that restriction.Wait, I recall that the number of walks of length k starting at 0, never going below 0, is given by the Catalan triangle numbers. The Catalan triangle has entries C(n, k) which count the number of Dyck paths of length 2n that end at height k. But in our case, the walks can have length k (not necessarily even) and end at any height. Wait, perhaps another approach.Alternatively, consider that each walk corresponds to a sequence of up and down steps, with the condition that the partial sums (i.e., the position after each step) never become negative. So, starting at 0, each step is +1 or -1, and never negative. The number of such sequences is known as the number of &quot;balanced&quot; sequences or sometimes called the number of positive walks.I think the formula for the number of such walks is indeed given by the binomial coefficient ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Let me check a reference or recall how this is derived.Alternatively, perhaps we can use recursion. Let’s denote ( f(n, m) ) as the number of walks of length ( n ) ending at position ( m ), without going below 0. Then, the total number we want is ( sum_{m=0}^k f(k, m) ). But maybe we can relate this to some known recursion.But actually, when you start at 0, after k steps, the possible positions you can end at are from 0 to k, but with parity: if k is even, the final position is even; if k is odd, the final position is odd.Moreover, the total number of walks without restrictions is ( 2^k ), but with the non-negativity constraint, it&#39;s less.Wait, but in our examples, for k=1, it&#39;s 1; total walks without restriction would be 2 (up or down), but since we can&#39;t go below 0, only 1 is allowed. For k=2, total walks without restriction are 4, but allowed ones are 2. For k=3, total walks are 8, allowed ones are 3. For k=4, total walks are 16, allowed ones are 6. So the numbers are ( 1, 2, 3, 6 ), which are 1, 2, 3, 6. These are the central binomial coefficients, but divided by something?Wait, no. The central binomial coefficients for n=1,2,3,4 are 2,6,20,70. Not matching. Wait, perhaps the numbers we have are the same as the number of ways to stay above zero, which is given by the Catalan numbers summed over different endpoints. Wait, but Catalan numbers count Dyck paths which return to zero. Maybe the numbers we are dealing with are called the &quot;Motzkin numbers&quot;? Wait, no, Motzkin numbers allow for flat steps as well. Maybe not.Alternatively, if we consider the number of walks starting at 0, never going below 0, with steps ±1. Then, according to the reflection principle, the number of such walks is equal to the binomial coefficient ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Alternatively, here&#39;s a possible approach: The number of walks of length k starting at 0, never dipping below 0, is equal to the number of walks that end at some height m, which must be equal to the number of up steps minus the number of down steps. So, for a walk with k steps, let u be the number of up steps and d the number of down steps. Then u + d = k, and u - d = m. So m = 2u - k. Since m must be non-negative (if we end at m), we have 2u - k ≥ 0, so u ≥ k/2. Hence, the number of such walks is the sum over u from ⌈k/2⌉ to k of the number of walks with u up steps and k - u down steps that never go below 0.But how do we count that? The reflection principle is used here. For walks that never go below 0, the number is equal to the total number of walks with u up and d down steps minus the number of walks that dip below 0.But the formula for the number of walks from 0 to m in k steps without going below 0 is given by the ballot theorem. The ballot problem states that the number of ways candidate A stays ahead of candidate B throughout the counting is (a - b)/(a + b) * C(a + b, a). Maybe applicable here.Alternatively, using the reflection principle, the number of walks that never go below 0 is equal to C(k, u) - C(k, u - 1), where u is the number of up steps.Wait, for the case when we want walks that end at position m = u - d = 2u - k, so rearranged, u = (k + m)/2. Since m must have the same parity as k, otherwise, it&#39;s zero.So for a given k, m can be 0, 1, ..., k with the same parity. For each possible m, the number of walks ending at m without going below 0 is C(k, (k + m)/2) - C(k, (k + m)/2 + 1). Hmm, but this is the formula for Dyck paths adjusted for different endpoints. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.Alternatively, the number of such walks is equal to the number of walks ending at m minus the number of walks ending at m that do go below 0. Using the reflection principle, we can compute the latter.The formula is C(k, (k + m)/2) - C(k, (k + m)/2 + t), where t is some adjustment. But I might need to recall the exact reflection principle application.Alternatively, for walks starting at 0, ending at m, with k steps, never dipping below 0: the number is C(k, (k + m)/2) - C(k, (k + m)/2 + 1). This is similar to the Catalan numbers but generalized.But if we need the total number over all possible m, that would be the sum over m of [C(k, (k + m)/2) - C(k, (k + m)/2 + 1)].But perhaps this sum telescopes. Let’s consider:Let m range from 0 to k (with step 2 if k is even, or 1 if k is odd). Wait, no, m has to have the same parity as k. So m can be 0, 2, ..., k if k is even; or 1, 3, ..., k if k is odd.Wait, for each m = 0, 1, ..., k, with the same parity as k, let’s denote u = (k + m)/2. Then, the number of walks ending at m is C(k, u) - C(k, u + 1). Therefore, summing over all possible m, the total number is sum_{u=⌈k/2⌉}^k [C(k, u) - C(k, u + 1)}].But this sum telescopes: the sum becomes [C(k, ⌈k/2⌉) - C(k, ⌈k/2⌉ + 1)] + [C(k, ⌈k/2⌉ + 1) - C(k, ⌈k/2⌉ + 2)] + ... + [C(k, k) - C(k, k + 1)].Since C(k, k + 1) = 0, the sum simplifies to C(k, ⌈k/2⌉).Wait, but ⌈k/2⌉ is equal to floor(k/2) + 1 if k is odd, and equal to k/2 if k is even. However, floor(k/2) = ⌈k/2⌉ - 1 if k is odd. Wait, actually, for k even, floor(k/2) = k/2, and for k odd, floor(k/2) = (k - 1)/2. So, the sum telescopes to C(k, floor(k/2) + 1) ?Wait, no, let&#39;s check.Wait, if k is even: k = 2n. Then m ranges from 0 to 2n in steps of 2. So u = (2n + m)/2. When m = 0, u = n. When m = 2n, u = 2n. So u ranges from n to 2n. The sum is [C(2n, n) - C(2n, n + 1)] + [C(2n, n + 1) - C(2n, n + 2)] + ... + [C(2n, 2n) - C(2n, 2n + 1)]. The terms cancel, leaving C(2n, n). So total sum is C(2n, n) = C(k, k/2).If k is odd: k = 2n + 1. Then m ranges from 1 to 2n + 1 in steps of 2. u = (2n + 1 + m)/2. When m = 1, u = (2n + 2)/2 = n + 1. When m = 2n + 1, u = (2n + 1 + 2n + 1)/2 = 2n + 1. So u ranges from n + 1 to 2n + 1. The sum is [C(2n + 1, n + 1) - C(2n + 1, n + 2)] + ... + [C(2n + 1, 2n + 1) - C(2n + 1, 2n + 2)]. Again, terms cancel, leaving C(2n + 1, n + 1). But in terms of k, n = (k - 1)/2, so C(k, (k + 1)/2). But for odd k, floor(k/2) = (k - 1)/2, so C(k, floor(k/2) + 1) = C(k, (k + 1)/2). But note that C(k, (k + 1)/2) = C(k, floor(k/2)).Wait, let&#39;s verify with k=3 (which is odd). Then floor(3/2)=1. C(3,1)=3, which is correct. For k=5, floor(5/2)=2. C(5,2)=10. Let&#39;s check k=5:Number of walks starting at 0, taking 5 steps, never dipping below 0. But enumerating all such walks would be tedious, but if our formula says 10, which is C(5,2)=10. Let&#39;s see, maybe for k=5, the number is 10. If so, then the formula holds.Therefore, in general, the total number of such walks is C(k, floor(k/2)), which is the same as ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Therefore, this proves the required result.Wait, but let me confirm with another example. Take k=5. Then floor(5/2)=2. C(5,2)=10. Let&#39;s see if there are 10 such walks.Starting at 0:First step must be 1.Second step can be 0 or 2.If second step is 0:Third step must be 1.Fourth step can be 0 or 2.Fifth step from 0 must be 1 or from 2 can be 1 or 3.Wait, this is getting complicated, but maybe instead of enumerating, trust the reflection principle result. If the sum telescopes to C(k, floor(k/2)), then the answer is as required.Therefore, the number of such arrays is equal to the binomial coefficient ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Hence, proved.But to formalize this proof, perhaps use generating functions or the reflection principle properly.Alternatively, another approach is to model this as a sequence of up and down moves, where we cannot go below 0. The problem is similar to counting the number of such sequences, which is known to be the central binomial coefficient.Wait, but actually, according to the reflection principle, the number of walks from 0 to m in k steps that never dip below 0 is ( dbinom{k}{(k + m)/2} - dbinom{k}{(k + m)/2 + 1} ). Then summing over all possible m (from 0 to k with steps of 2) gives the total number of walks, which telescopes to ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Therefore, this is the result.Hence, the conclusion is that the number of such arrays is indeed ( dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), so the proof is complete.Final AnswerThe number of such arrays is boxed{dbinom{k}{leftlfloor k/2 rightrfloor}}.&lt;/think&gt;To prove that there are exactly (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}) arrays (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1}) of nonnegative integers such that (a_1 = 0) and (|a_i - a_{i+1}| = 1) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, k), we can relate this problem to counting the number of walks on the nonnegative integers starting at 0, taking (k) steps of ±1, and never going below 0.1. Understanding the Problem:   - The array starts at 0, and each subsequent element differs by 1.   - This is equivalent to a walk starting at 0, taking steps of +1 or -1, and never going below 0.2. Reflection Principle and Combinatorial Argument:   - The number of such walks is given by the reflection principle, which helps count the number of valid paths that do not cross a boundary.   - For a walk of length (k), the number of valid paths can be derived using the reflection principle and results in the binomial coefficient (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).3. Telescoping Sum:   - The number of valid walks ending at position (m) (with the same parity as (k)) is given by the difference of binomial coefficients.   - Summing these valid walks over all possible end positions (m) results in a telescoping series, which simplifies to (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).4. Verification with Examples:   - Small values of (k) (1, 2, 3, 4) were checked to ensure the formula holds, matching the binomial coefficient (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).Thus, the number of such arrays is proven to be (boxed{dbinom{k}{leftlfloor k/2 rightrfloor}}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to prove that the number of arrays ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1} ) of nonnegative integers with ( a_1 = 0 ) and ( |a_i - a_{i+1}| = 1 ) for each ( i ) from 1 to ( k ) is exactly ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Hmm, let&#39;s start by understanding the problem better.First, the array starts with 0, so ( a_1 = 0 ). Then each subsequent term differs by exactly 1. That means each term is either one more or one less than the previous term. However, since we&#39;re dealing with nonnegative integers, we can&#39;t have a term go below 0. So, whenever we have a term that&#39;s 0, the next term must be 1, because it can&#39;t be -1.This seems like a kind of restricted walk starting at 0, taking steps of +1 or -1, but never going below 0. So, maybe this is related to Dyck paths or Catalan numbers? But the problem mentions the binomial coefficient ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), which is different from Catalan numbers. Let me check for small values of ( k ) to see if I can spot a pattern.Let&#39;s start with ( k = 1 ). Then the array has two elements: ( a_1 = 0 ) and ( a_2 ). Since ( |a_1 - a_2| = 1 ), ( a_2 ) must be 1. So there&#39;s only 1 array. Now, ( binom{1}{0} = 1 ), which matches. Here ( lfloor 1/2 rfloor = 0 ).For ( k = 2 ), the array has three elements: ( a_1 = 0 ), ( a_2 ), ( a_3 ). Starting at 0, ( a_2 ) must be 1. Then ( a_3 ) can be either 0 or 2. However, 2 is allowed because we&#39;re only restricted to nonnegative integers. Wait, but the problem allows nonnegative integers, so 0, 1, 2 are all okay. So from ( a_2 = 1 ), ( a_3 ) can be 0 or 2. So two possibilities. Then ( binom{2}{1} = 2 ), which matches. Here ( lfloor 2/2 rfloor = 1 ).For ( k = 3 ), the array has four elements. Let&#39;s see:Starting at 0, ( a_2 = 1 ). Then ( a_3 ) can be 0 or 2.Case 1: ( a_3 = 0 ). Then ( a_4 ) must be 1 (can&#39;t go to -1). So path is 0,1,0,1.Case 2: ( a_3 = 2 ). Then ( a_4 ) can be 1 or 3. So two possibilities: 0,1,2,1 and 0,1,2,3.Thus total of 1 + 2 = 3. But ( binom{3}{1} = 3 ), since ( lfloor 3/2 rfloor = 1 ). Wait, but ( binom{3}{1} = 3 ), which matches. So that&#39;s okay.Wait, but Catalan numbers for Dyck paths of length 2n are ( frac{1}{n+1}binom{2n}{n} ). For n=2 (length 4), Catalan number is 2, but here for k=3, the number of arrays is 3. So it&#39;s different.So perhaps this is a different kind of walk. Maybe it&#39;s a Motzkin path? Or maybe something else.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a bijection between these arrays and certain binary sequences, where each step is either +1 or -1, but with some constraints. Since each step is ±1, we can model the sequence as a sequence of up and down steps. However, since we can&#39;t go below 0, not all sequences are allowed.But the total number here is given as ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), which is the middle binomial coefficient when k is even. For example, if k is even, say k=4, then ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ). Let me check for k=4.For k=4, we need arrays of length 5 (since k+1). Let&#39;s try to count them.Start at 0, then step to 1. Then:Possible paths:0,1,0,1,0,1Wait, no, k=4, so steps from 1 to 4. Let me recount:Wait, for k=4, the array has 5 elements: a1 to a5. Starting at 0, each subsequent term differs by 1, nonnegative.Let me try to list all possible arrays:Start: 0First step to 1.Second step can be 0 or 2.If second step is 0:Third step must be 1.Fourth step can be 0 or 2.If fourth step is 0, fifth step must be 1.If fourth step is 2, fifth step can be 1 or 3.So from the 0,1,0,1 path:0,1,0,1,0 (invalid because fifth step from 1 must be 0 or 2, but 0 is allowed? Wait, fifth step is a5. Wait, the array is a1=0, a2=1, a3=0, a4=1, a5. So a5 can be 0 or 2. Wait, so two possibilities here.Wait, perhaps my previous reasoning was wrong. Let me approach it step by step.For k=4, starting at 0:1. 0,1,0,1,02. 0,1,0,1,23. 0,1,0,1 (then a5 can be 0 or 2) – yes, that&#39;s two.Then from the second step to 2:If second step is 2:Third step can be 1 or 3.If third step is 1:Fourth step can be 0 or 2.If fourth step is 0, fifth step must be 1.If fourth step is 2, fifth step can be 1 or 3.If third step is 3:Fourth step can be 2 or 4.If fourth step is 2, fifth step can be 1 or 3.If fourth step is 4, fifth step can be 3 or 5.So let&#39;s see:From second step 2:Third step 1:Fourth step 0: fifth step 1.Fourth step 2: fifth step 1 or 3.Third step 3:Fourth step 2: fifth step 1 or 3.Fourth step 4: fifth step 3 or 5.So total possibilities from second step 2:From third step 1:0,1,2,1,0 → invalid, because from a4=1, a5 can be 0 or 2. Wait, no: starting from third step 1 (a3=1), fourth step can be 0 or 2. Wait, no, if third step is 1, then a4 can be 0 or 2.Wait, this is getting complex. Maybe instead of enumerating, think recursively.Let me denote ( C(n, h) ) as the number of ways to reach height h at step n. Then, since each step is ±1, but can&#39;t go below 0.But in this problem, the first step is fixed: from 0 to 1. So perhaps the total number is equivalent to walks of length k-1 starting at 1, with steps ±1, never going below 0.Wait, but the total steps are k steps (since from a1 to a_{k+1} is k steps). However, a1 is fixed at 0, then a2 is 1, so the remaining k-1 steps start from 1. So the problem reduces to counting walks of length k starting at 0, first step to 1, then k-1 steps with ±1, never going below 0.Alternatively, the total number is the number of walks starting at 0, making k steps of ±1, never going below 0, and ending at some height. Wait, but in our case, the walk has to start at 0, with the first step up to 1, then proceed.Wait, maybe it&#39;s equivalent to Dyck paths but with different length. Wait, Dyck paths are walks that return to 0, but here we don&#39;t have to return.Alternatively, the number of such walks is given by the Catalan numbers, but here the total is different. Wait, for k=1, 1 way; k=2, 2 ways; k=3, 3 ways; k=4, 6 ways? Wait, let me check k=4 again.Wait, for k=4, according to the formula, it should be ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ). Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s correct.Possible arrays of length 5 (indices 1 to 5):Starting with 0,1.Then possibilities:1. 0,1,0,1,0,1 – Wait, but k=4, so the array is length 5. So from a1=0, a2=1, a3 can be 0 or 2.Let me try to list all possibilities:1. 0,1,0,1,02. 0,1,0,1,23. 0,1,2,1,04. 0,1,2,1,25. 0,1,2,3,26. 0,1,2,3,4So that&#39;s 6 arrays. Yes, that matches ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ). So okay, so for k=4, the formula works.So perhaps in general, the number is the central binomial coefficient, but when k is even, it&#39;s ( binom{k}{k/2} ), and when k is odd, it&#39;s ( binom{k}{(k-1)/2} } ). Wait, but the problem states ( binom{k}{[k/2]} ), which is the floor of k/2. Wait, but for k=3, floor(3/2)=1, and ( binom{3}{1}=3 ), which matches. For k=4, floor(4/2)=2, and ( binom{4}{2}=6 ). So yes, the formula is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).So the problem is to prove that the number of such walks is equal to this binomial coefficient. Now, how to approach this?Perhaps we can model the problem as sequences of up and down steps, starting at 0, with the first step up, and never going below 0. Then, after k steps (leading to a_{k+1}), how many such sequences are there?Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a bijection between these sequences and certain subsets. The binomial coefficient suggests choosing a certain number of steps to be up or down.Wait, but in a walk of k steps (starting at 0, first step up), each step is +1 or -1, but never going below 0. The total displacement after k steps would be... Starting at 0, first step to 1, then k-1 more steps. The final position is 1 + (number of up steps - number of down steps). But since each step after the first is either +1 or -1, the total number of steps is k steps (including the first step). Wait, actually, the first step is fixed as +1, then we have k-1 steps. So total displacement is 1 + (number of up steps in the remaining k-1 steps) - (number of down steps in the remaining k-1 steps). Let me denote the number of up steps as u and down steps as d. So u + d = k - 1, and displacement is 1 + u - d = 1 + (u - d). But since displacement is also equal to the final height, which is nonnegative. So 1 + u - d ≥ 0. But also, the walk must never go below 0. So even if the final displacement is nonnegative, the intermediate steps must not go below 0.This seems similar to the Ballot problem, where we count the number of walks from 0 to some positive value that stay positive. The Ballot theorem states that the number of ways candidate A stays ahead of candidate B throughout the counting is (a - b)/(a + b) * C(a + b, a). Maybe similar ideas apply here.Alternatively, using the reflection principle to count the number of walks that stay above zero. The reflection principle is often used to count such paths by subtracting the number of paths that cross below zero.But in our case, the first step is fixed as +1, so we can model the remaining k - 1 steps. Let me consider the number of paths starting at 1, taking k - 1 steps of ±1, never going below 0. The total number of such paths would be equal to the number we&#39;re seeking.To count these, we can use the reflection principle. The total number of unrestricted paths starting at 1 with k - 1 steps is ( 2^{k - 1} ). But we need to subtract those that go below 0.Alternatively, the formula for the number of paths starting at x, ending at y, with n steps, never going below 0 is given by the Catalan-like numbers or using the reflection principle. The general formula might be ( binom{n}{frac{n + y - x}{2}} - binom{n}{frac{n + y - x}{2} + (x + 1)}} ), but I need to recall the exact formula.Alternatively, for paths starting at 1, ending at some height m ≥ 0, with k - 1 steps, never going below 0. The number of such paths is equal to the number of Dyck paths adjusted for the starting point. Alternatively, use generating functions.Alternatively, think of this as a state problem where each state is the current height, and we can model transitions. Let me define ( f(n, h) ) as the number of ways to reach height h after n steps without going below 0. We start at step 0 with height 1 (since after the first step, we&#39;re at 1). Wait, no: the problem starts at a1=0, then a2=1, so the remaining k - 1 steps start at 1. So we need to compute ( f(k - 1, h) ), the number of ways to be at height h after k - 1 steps starting from 1, never going below 0. Then the total number is the sum over all h ≥ 0 of ( f(k - 1, h) ).But how to compute this?The recursion would be ( f(n, h) = f(n - 1, h - 1) + f(n - 1, h + 1) ) for h ≥ 1, and ( f(n, 0) = f(n - 1, 1) ). The base case is ( f(0, 1) = 1 ), and ( f(0, h) = 0 ) for h ≠ 1.But solving this recursion might be complicated. Alternatively, using generating functions or some combinatorial argument.Alternatively, using the reflection principle: the number of paths from 1 to h in k - 1 steps that never touch 0 is equal to the total number of paths from 1 to h minus the number of paths that touch 0.But how do we compute the number of paths that touch 0?By the reflection principle, the number of paths from 1 to h in k - 1 steps that touch 0 is equal to the number of paths from 1 to h with a reflection across 0. Wait, the reflection principle states that the number of paths from A to B that cross a boundary can be computed by reflecting the starting point.In our case, paths starting at 1, ending at h, touching 0. The reflection of 1 across 0 is -1. So the number of such paths is equal to the number of paths from -1 to h in k - 1 steps. Because each path that starts at 1, touches 0, can be reflected after the first touch to start at -1.Therefore, the number of paths from 1 to h that never touch 0 is ( binom{k - 1}{frac{(k - 1) + (h - 1)}{2}} - binom{k - 1}{frac{(k - 1) + (h + 1)}{2}} ).Wait, perhaps. The total number of paths from 1 to h in k - 1 steps is ( binom{k - 1}{frac{(k - 1) + (h - 1)}{2}} ), since each step is +1 or -1. The number of up steps u and down steps d must satisfy u - d = h - 1 and u + d = k - 1. Solving these gives u = (k - 1 + h - 1)/2 = (k + h - 2)/2, so the number of paths is ( binom{k - 1}{(k + h - 2)/2} ).Similarly, the number of paths that touch 0 would be ( binom{k - 1}{(k - 1 + (h + 1))/2} ), by reflecting the starting point. Wait, let me check.The reflection principle says that the number of paths from A to B that cross a barrier is equal to the number of paths from A&#39; to B, where A&#39; is the reflection of A across the barrier. So in our case, the number of paths from 1 to h that touch 0 is equal to the number of paths from -1 to h. Because each path from 1 to h that touches 0 can be associated with a path from -1 to h by reflecting the part of the path before the first touch of 0.The number of paths from -1 to h in k - 1 steps is ( binom{k - 1}{frac{(k - 1) + (h + 1)}{2}} ), since u - d = h - (-1) = h + 1, and u + d = k - 1. Therefore, u = (k - 1 + h + 1)/2 = (k + h)/2. So the number is ( binom{k - 1}{(k + h)/2} ).Therefore, the number of paths from 1 to h that never touch 0 is:( binom{k - 1}{(k + h - 2)/2} - binom{k - 1}{(k + h)/2} ).But this is only valid if (k + h - 2)/2 and (k + h)/2 are integers. If not, then those binomial coefficients are zero.But the total number of paths that never touch 0 is the sum over all h of the above expression. However, this seems complicated. Maybe there&#39;s a simpler approach.Alternatively, notice that the number we&#39;re looking for is the same as the number of balanced parentheses or Dyck paths, but adjusted for the starting point.Alternatively, consider that after the first step, we&#39;re at 1, and we have k - 1 steps remaining. Each path corresponds to a sequence of up and down steps, starting at 1, never going below 0. This is similar to the Ballot problem where candidate A must always be ahead.The Ballot theorem states that if candidate A gets a votes and candidate B gets b votes with a &gt; b, the number of ways the votes can be counted so that A is always ahead is ( frac{a - b}{a + b} binom{a + b}{a} ).In our case, starting at 1, we can think of each up step as a vote for A and each down step as a vote for B. To stay above 0, the number of up steps must always exceed the number of down steps by at least 1. So if we have u up steps and d down steps in k - 1 steps, then u - d ≥ 1 (since we start at 1). Also, u + d = k - 1. Therefore, u = (k - 1 + d + 1)/2 = (k + d)/2. Wait, perhaps not directly applicable.Alternatively, using the formula from the Ballot theorem, the number of paths that start at 1, take k - 1 steps, never go below 0, is equal to ( binom{k - 1}{lfloor (k - 1)/2 rfloor} ). Wait, but that doesn&#39;t seem to align with the Ballot theorem formula.Wait, let&#39;s consider the Ballot theorem with a = u, b = d. Then, the number of paths where A stays ahead is ( frac{u - d}{u + d} binom{u + d}{u} ).In our case, starting at 1, after k - 1 steps, the final position is 1 + u - d. To never go below 0, the path must never reach -1 from the starting point 1, which is equivalent to never going below 0 in the original problem. So the Ballot theorem might apply here if we set a and b such that a - b corresponds to the final displacement.But I need to relate this to our problem. Let&#39;s think: if we have k - 1 steps, starting at position 1, and never going below 0. Let u be the number of up steps and d be the number of down steps. Then u + d = k - 1, and the final position is 1 + u - d. For the path to never go below 0, we must have that at any point, the cumulative difference u&#39; - d&#39; ≥ -1, where u&#39; and d&#39; are the number of up and down steps up to that point. Wait, starting at 1, after t steps, the position is 1 + u&#39; - d&#39;. To never go below 0, we must have 1 + u&#39; - d&#39; ≥ 0 for all t. Therefore, u&#39; - d&#39; ≥ -1. Which is equivalent to u&#39; + 1 ≥ d&#39;. Which is similar to the Ballot problem where candidate A (u&#39;) needs to be at least candidate B (d&#39;) minus 1.Alternatively, shifting the starting point: if we consider the position as x = 1 + u&#39; - d&#39;, then the condition x ≥ 0 translates to u&#39; - d&#39; ≥ -1. Let&#39;s set a = u&#39; + 1 and b = d&#39;. Then the condition becomes a - b ≥ 0, i.e., a ≥ b. So this is similar to the Ballot problem where we want the number of sequences where a ≥ b for all prefixes.But here, a = u&#39; + 1 and b = d&#39;, so the total votes for A would be u&#39; + 1 and votes for B is d&#39;. However, the total votes by the end would be a = u + 1 and b = d. Since u + d = k - 1, the total votes a + b = u + 1 + d = k. So by the Ballot theorem, the number of such sequences is ( frac{a - b}{a + b} binom{a + b}{a} = frac{(u + 1 - d)}{k} binom{k}{u + 1} ).But I&#39;m not sure how this helps. Wait, maybe substituting u = (k - 1 + (final_position - 1))/2. Since final_position = 1 + u - d = 1 + (u - (k - 1 - u)) = 1 + 2u - (k - 1). Therefore, final_position = 2u - k + 2. Hmm, this seems complicated.Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. The generating function for such walks is the generating function for the Catalan numbers, but shifted. The Catalan generating function is ( C(x) = frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x} ). But in our case, since we start with a step up, maybe the generating function is x * C(x). But I need to check.Wait, the standard Dyck paths start at 0 and return to 0, but here we have paths starting at 0, going up to 1, and then moving up and down without going below 0. So the generating function might be different.Alternatively, consider that after the first step, we have a Dyck path that never goes below 1, but that&#39;s not quite right either. Maybe we can model this as a shifted Dyck path.Alternatively, the number we are looking for is the same as the number of Dyck paths of length 2n, but with some relation to k. Wait, perhaps not.Alternatively, think in terms of the formula given in the problem: ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). This is the maximal binomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to choose half (rounded down) elements from a set of size k. So maybe each such array corresponds to choosing a subset of positions where we go up, and the other positions we go down, but with the constraint of not going below 0.However, the constraint complicates things. But perhaps there is a bijection between these walks and certain subsets. For example, maybe the walks that reach maximum height ( lfloor k/2 rfloor + 1 ), but I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, note that the number ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ) is the number of ways to have an equal number of up and down steps when k is even, or one more up step when k is odd. Wait, for example, when k is even, say k=4, then ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ), which would correspond to 2 up steps and 2 down steps in the remaining k - 1=3 steps. Wait, no, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Wait, k=4, the remaining steps after the first up step is 3 steps. So total steps: 1 up (fixed) + 3 steps (either up or down). The total displacement is 1 + (number of ups - number of downs). But the final displacement can be anything as long as the path never goes below 0.Alternatively, maybe each such walk corresponds to a binary string of length k with certain properties, and the number of such strings is the binomial coefficient given.Alternatively, consider that in order to not go below 0, the number of up steps must always be at least the number of down steps at any prefix. But starting from 1, after the first step, so maybe the number of up steps must be at least the number of down steps plus 1. So, over k steps (since first step is up, then k - 1 steps), the total number of up steps must be at least the number of down steps. Wait, no: starting at 1, each time you go up, you increase the height, each time you go down, you decrease. To never go below 0, the number of downs can never exceed the number of ups plus 1.Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to sequences of k steps (after the first up step) where the number of up steps is always at least the number of down steps. This seems similar to the concept of Catalan numbers, but with a different starting point.Alternatively, use recursive reasoning. Let ( f(n, h) ) be the number of walks of length n starting at height h, never going below 0. Then ( f(n, h) = f(n - 1, h - 1) + f(n - 1, h + 1) ) for h ≥ 1, and ( f(n, 0) = f(n - 1, 1) ).But to compute the total number for our problem, we need ( f(k - 1, 1) ), since we start at 1 and take k - 1 steps. Wait, no: starting at 1, take k - 1 steps, so the total number is ( f(k - 1, 1) ). But how does this relate to the binomial coefficients?Wait, perhaps using generating functions. The generating function for ( f(n, 1) ) would satisfy certain recurrence relations.Alternatively, consider that the number of such walks is equal to the number of walks starting at 0, taking k steps, never going below 0, and ending at some height. But with the first step fixed as +1. This might relate to the formula given.Alternatively, use the concept of cyclic shifts or other combinatorial transformations.Alternatively, notice that ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ) is the number of ways to choose ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ) elements from k, which is the same as the number of ways to have a balanced sequence when k is even, or nearly balanced when k is odd. Perhaps the non-crossing constraint allows us to map each valid walk to a subset of size ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ).Alternatively, consider that in such a walk, the number of times we go up must be at least the number of times we go down at any point. Since we start at 0 and first step up to 1, we can represent the walk as a sequence of U&#39;s (up) and D&#39;s (down). The condition is that in any prefix, the number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s. Wait, but starting from 0, first step is U to 1. Then, in the remaining k - 1 steps, the number of U&#39;s must be at least the number of D&#39;s minus 1? Wait, no.Wait, let&#39;s model the entire walk. Starting at 0, the first step is U to 1. Then, each subsequent step is U or D, but the walk must never go below 0. So after the first U, we have a walk starting at 1, taking k - 1 steps, never going below 0. The number of such walks is equal to the Catalan number ( C_{k - 1} )? Wait, no. For example, when k=2, it&#39;s 2 ways, but ( C_1 = 1 ). When k=3, it&#39;s 3 ways, but ( C_2 = 2 ). So that&#39;s not matching.Alternatively, maybe it&#39;s the number of Motzkin paths or some other kind.Alternatively, think about generating all possible sequences and mapping them to subsets. For example, each time you go up, you can think of it as choosing a position, and each time you go down, another. But this is vague.Alternatively, use the fact that the number of walks of length n starting at 0 with ±1 steps and never going below 0 is ( binom{n}{lfloor n/2 rfloor} ). Wait, but is that true? For n=1, it&#39;s 1 (up), which is ( binom{1}{0}=1 ). For n=2, it&#39;s UU and UD, which is 2, which is ( binom{2}{1}=2 ). For n=3, UUU, UUD, UDU, UDD (but UDD would go below 0 after third step: starting at 0, U to 1, D to 0, D to -1 which is invalid. So actually, for n=3, the valid sequences are UUU, UUD, UDU. So 3, which is ( binom{3}{1}=3 ). For n=4, UUUU, UUUD, UUDU, UUDD (invalid), UDUU, UDUD (invalid), UDDU (invalid), DUUU (invalid start). Wait, starting at 0, so first step must be U. So for n=4, sequences starting with U, then three steps. Let me list all possibilities:1. U, U, U, U2. U, U, U, D3. U, U, D, U4. U, U, D, D (invalid at fourth step: 0 +1 +1 -1 -1 =0, then D to -1 invalid)Wait, starting at 0:After first step U: position 1Second step U: position 2Third step U: position 3Fourth step U: position 4Fourth step D: position 3Third step D: position 1Fourth step U: position 2Fourth step D: position 0But from position 0, can&#39;t go D. Wait, the fourth step would be from position 1 after third step D (from position 2):1. U, U, U, U2. U, U, U, D (positions: 0→1→2→3→2)3. U, U, D, U (positions: 0→1→2→1→2)4. U, U, D, D (positions: 0→1→2→1→0) which is valid, right? Wait, from position 1, D to 0. Then from 0, can&#39;t D. But in this case, fourth step is D from position 1 to 0, which is allowed. Wait, but we have to ensure that we never go below 0. So:Sequence 4: positions are 0,1,2,1,0. That&#39;s valid. So fourth step D is allowed.Wait, so for n=4, starting with U, the sequences are:1. U, U, U, U2. U, U, U, D3. U, U, D, U4. U, U, D, D5. U, D, U, U6. U, D, U, D7. U, D, D, U (positions: 0→1→0→-1 invalid)Wait, no, let&#39;s check:Sequence 5: U, D, U, UPositions: 0→1→0→1→2. Valid.Sequence 6: U, D, U, DPositions: 0→1→0→1→0. Valid.Sequence 7: U, D, D, UPositions: 0→1→0→-1 invalid. So invalid.So valid sequences are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Total 6, which is ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ). So for n=4, it&#39;s 6.Similarly, for n=3, sequences were:1. U, U, U2. U, U, D3. U, D, U4. U, D, D (invalid)So 3 valid sequences, which is ( binom{3}{1} = 3 ).So this seems to hold. Therefore, the number of walks starting at 0, first step U, with n total steps, never going below 0 is ( binom{n}{lfloor n/2 rfloor} ). Therefore, in the original problem, the number of arrays is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).But then why is this the case? For each n, the number of such walks is ( binom{n}{lfloor n/2 rfloor} ). So if we can establish this bijection, we can prove the result.Alternatively, recognize that the number of such walks is equal to the number of ways to choose positions of the U steps (or D steps) such that the walk never goes below 0. This is similar to the concept of Catalan numbers, but instead here, the numbers correspond to the central binomial coefficients.Wait, but the central binomial coefficient is ( binom{2n}{n} ), which counts the number of walks of 2n steps that end where they started. But in our case, the walks do not necessarily return to the origin.However, the numbers here do not seem to match Catalan numbers but central binomial coefficients when k is even. Wait, for k=4, it&#39;s 6 which is ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ), which is the central coefficient. For k=3, it&#39;s 3, which is ( binom{3}{1} = 3 ), which is not the central coefficient. So perhaps for even k, it&#39;s the central coefficient, and for odd k, it&#39;s the middle one. Since floor(k/2) for even k is k/2, and for odd k is (k-1)/2.So the formula given is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), which matches the central coefficient for even k and the near-central for odd k.But how to prove that the number of such walks is equal to this binomial coefficient?Perhaps use induction. Suppose that for a given k, the number of valid walks is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). Then, for k + 1, we can relate it to the previous case. But I need to establish a recurrence.Alternatively, note that the number of walks that never go below 0 starting with a U step is equal to the number of walks that have at least as many U&#39;s as D&#39;s in every prefix. This is similar to Dyck paths, but allowing the path to end at any height, not necessarily 0. These are called &quot;ballot numbers&quot; or &quot;positive walks&quot;.The ballot problem gives the number of such walks where one candidate stays ahead. For our case, the number of walks starting with a U, never going below 0, is given by ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).According to the formula for the Ballot problem, if we want the number of walks where U stays strictly above D, then it&#39;s ( binom{k - 1}{lfloor k/2 rfloor - 1} } ). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, refer to the literature: apparently, the number of walks of length n starting at 0, with steps ±1, never going below 0, is given by the central binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{lfloor n/2 rfloor} ). This seems to be the case from our small examples. If that&#39;s a known result, then we can cite it. But since this is a proof problem, we need to show why it&#39;s true.Alternatively, note that each walk corresponds to a sequence of U&#39;s and D&#39;s starting with U, and the condition is that in any prefix, the number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s. The total number of such sequences is indeed ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).To see this, observe that such sequences are in bijection with the subsets of positions where the walk goes up. The constraint that the number of U&#39;s is always at least the number of D&#39;s translates to the subset being such that in any prefix, the number of chosen positions (U&#39;s) is at least half the length of the prefix. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;dominating set&quot;.But how to count these subsets? It might be related to the concept of combinations with certain restrictions. However, the number ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ) is the largest binomial coefficient, which occurs when we choose half (rounded down) of the elements. This suggests that the number of such subsets is maximized when we choose as close to half as possible.Alternatively, consider the following reflection argument adapted to this problem.The total number of walks starting with U is ( 2^{k - 1} ). From these, we subtract the number of walks that go below 0 at some point. To count the latter, we can use the reflection principle.Each walk that starts with U and goes below 0 must touch -1 at some point. Let&#39;s reflect the walk at the first point where it goes below 0 (i.e., reaches -1). The reflection of such a walk would start with U, then eventually reach -1, and we can reflect the steps after the first U to get a walk that starts at U, goes to some path, and ends at -1. But how does this help?Alternatively, reflecting the entire walk across the x-axis after the first step. Wait, this might be more complicated.Alternatively, consider transforming a walk that starts with U and goes below 0 into a walk that starts with D, and vice versa. If we have a walk starting with U that touches -1, then by reflecting all steps before the first touch of -1, we can map it to a walk starting with D. But this is vague.Wait, here&#39;s a precise reflection argument:Let’s consider all walks starting with U (i.e., first step is U) that have k steps (from a1 to a_{k+1}). The total number is ( 2^{k - 1} ).The number of such walks that never go below 0 is N = ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).We need to show that N = ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Let’s denote by B the number of bad walks (those that go below 0). So N = ( 2^{k - 1} - B ).We need to compute B.To compute B, we can use the reflection principle. Each bad walk touches -1 for the first time at some point. Let’s reflect the walk at the first time it reaches -1.The reflection principle states that the number of walks starting at 0, first step U, that touch -1 is equal to the number of walks starting at 0, first step U, then reflected to start at -2 after the first step. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, suppose a walk starts with U (to 1), then at some point reaches -1. Let’s find the first time it reaches -1, say at step t. Up to step t, the walk goes from 0 →1 → … → -1. Reflecting the steps from the first step (after the initial U step) across the x-axis would map this walk to a walk that starts at 0 →1 → … → 1 + ... → -1. Hmm, perhaps this is not straightforward.Alternatively, consider the following mapping: for any walk that starts with U and goes below 0, consider the first step where it goes below 0. Before that step, the walk was at 0. Then, we take a D step to -1. Let’s flip all steps before this first descent below 0. That is, if the walk goes from 0 to 1, then some path until it reaches 0 again, then a D step to -1, then we flip the steps before the -1. However, this might not result in a bijection.Alternatively, use the reflection principle as follows: For any walk starting at 0, first step U, that reaches -1, there is a corresponding walk starting at 0, first step D, which is reflected. The number of such bad walks is equal to the number of walks starting with D, which is ( 2^{k - 1} ), but this can&#39;t be right.Wait, the reflection principle for walks starting at 0 with first step U is tricky because the first step is fixed. Maybe consider all possible walks starting at 0, first step U, and reflect them after the first step.Wait, let me think. For a walk starting at 0, first step U to 1, then proceeding to some path that eventually touches -1. The reflection principle usually reflects the part of the path after the first touch of the barrier. So, the number of such paths can be mapped to the number of paths starting at 0, first step U, reaching -1, which is equal to the number of paths starting at 0, first step D, which is ( binom{k - 1}{(k - 1 + (-1 - 0))/2} = binom{k - 1}{(k - 2)/2} ). But this is only valid if k - 2 is even.Wait, the number of paths starting at 0, first step D would be zero because our walk must start with U. Wait, no, in the reflection principle, we consider the number of paths starting at 0, first step U, that reach -1. By reflecting these paths at the first time they reach -1, we can map them to paths starting at 0, first step D, and so on. However, this is getting too vague.Alternatively, consider that the number of walks starting with U, taking k - 1 more steps, never going below 0, is equal to the number of ways to arrange U&#39;s and D&#39;s such that every prefix has at least as many U&#39;s as D&#39;s. This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the solution is known to be the ballot number.The ballot problem states that the number of ways candidate A stays ahead of candidate B is ( frac{a - b}{a + b} binom{a + b}{a} ). In our case, starting with a U, we need that in the remaining k - 1 steps, the number of U&#39;s is always at least the number of D&#39;s. Let’s set a = number of U&#39;s and b = number of D&#39;s. Then a + b = k - 1, and a ≥ b. But since we start at 1, every time we have a D, we decrement the current height, starting from 1. To never go below 0, we need that the number of D&#39;s never exceeds the number of U&#39;s +1. So, for the entire walk, the total number of U&#39;s in the k -1 steps must be at least the number of D&#39;s. Wait, a ≥ b. Since a + b = k -1, this implies a ≥ (k -1)/2. So the number of such walks is the sum over a = ceil((k -1)/2) to k -1 of ( binom{k -1}{a} ).But ( sum_{a = lceil (k -1)/2 rceil}^{k -1} binom{k -1}{a} = 2^{k - 2} ). For example, when k=2, sum from a=1 to 1: ( binom{1}{1} = 1 ), but 2^{0}=1, which matches. When k=3, sum from a=2 to 2: ( binom{2}{2} = 1 ), but 2^{1}=2, which doesn&#39;t match. Wait, this is incorrect.Wait, the sum from a=ceil((k-1)/2) to k-1 of ( binom{k-1}{a} ) is equal to 2^{k-2} if k-1 is odd, and 2^{k-2} + binom{k-1}{(k-1)/2}/2 if k-1 is even. For example, when k=3, sum from a=1 to 2: ( binom{2}{1} + binom{2}{2} = 2 +1 =3 ), which is not 2^{1}=2. So this approach doesn&#39;t directly give us the desired result.Alternatively, use generating functions. The generating function for the number of walks starting at 1, never going below 0, is ( C(x) = frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x} ), which is the Catalan generating function. However, the coefficients of this generating function are the Catalan numbers, which don&#39;t match our counts. For example, the coefficient of x^1 is 1, x^2 is 2, x^3 is 5, but in our case, for k-1=1, we have 1 walk; for k-1=2, 2 walks; k-1=3, 3 walks, which doesn&#39;t match.Wait, this is confusing. But in our earlier examples, the numbers do match the binomial coefficients, not the Catalan numbers. For example, k=3 gives 3, which is ( binom{3}{1} ), and k=4 gives 6, which is ( binom{4}{2} ). So perhaps there&#39;s a direct bijection between these walks and the subsets of size ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ).Here&#39;s an idea: consider that in any walk that starts with U and never goes below 0, the number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s. So, for k steps (including the first U), the total number of U&#39;s is u and D&#39;s is d, with u + d = k. Since we start with a U, u ≥ d + 1. Therefore, u ≥ (k + 1)/2. For k even, u ≥ (k/2) + 0.5 → u ≥ k/2 + 1 (since u must be integer). Wait, no. For k even, k = 2m, then u ≥ m +1. For k odd, k = 2m +1, then u ≥ m +1.So the number of such walks is the sum over u = ceil(k/2 + 0.5) to k of ( binom{k -1}{u -1} ), since the first step is fixed as U, and the remaining k -1 steps have u -1 U&#39;s and d = k -1 - (u -1) = k - u D&#39;s. Therefore, the number is ( sum_{u = lceil (k + 1)/2 rceil}^{k} binom{k -1}{u -1} ).But this sum is equal to ( sum_{u&#39; = lceil (k +1)/2 rceil -1}^{k -1} binom{k -1}{u&#39;} } ). Let&#39;s substitute u&#39; = u -1. Then the sum becomes ( sum_{u&#39; = lceil (k -1)/2 rceil}^{k -1} binom{k -1}{u&#39;} } ). This is the sum of the upper half of the binomial coefficients, which is equal to ( 2^{k -2} ). But in our examples, for k=2, this sum is ( binom{1}{1} = 1 ), which is 2^{0}=1. For k=3, the sum is ( binom{2}{1} + binom{2}{2} = 2 + 1 =3 ), which is 2^{1}=2, which doesn&#39;t match. So again, this approach fails.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a direct correspondence between the steps and the subsets. For example, choosing the positions where the walk returns to a new minimum or something like that. But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, let&#39;s think of the walk as a sequence of U&#39;s and D&#39;s. Each time the walk reaches a new minimum, it must be followed by a U. But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, consider that each such walk can be uniquely encoded by a binary string of length k starting with 1 (for the first U), followed by k-1 bits where the number of 1&#39;s (U&#39;s) is always at least the number of 0&#39;s (D&#39;s) when counted from the start. This is similar to the concept of a &quot;prefix code&quot; or Dyck words, but allowing arbitrary endings.However, the number of such binary strings is known to be the Catalan numbers only if they return to zero. In our case, they don&#39;t have to return to zero, so the number is larger.But our examples show that for k=2, it&#39;s 2, which is ( binom{2}{1} ), k=3 it&#39;s 3, ( binom{3}{1} ), k=4 it&#39;s 6, ( binom{4}{2} ). So it seems that the number is ( binom{k -1}{lfloor (k -1)/2 rfloor} ). Wait, but for k=2, this would be ( binom{1}{0} =1 ), which doesn&#39;t match. So that&#39;s not.Wait, no: for k=2, the number is 2, which is ( binom{2}{1} =2 ). For k=3, ( binom{3}{1}=3 ), k=4, ( binom{4}{2}=6 ). So it&#39;s ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Ah, so the formula is actually ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). So if we can show that the number of such walks is equal to this binomial coefficient, we&#39;re done.But how to establish this bijection?One possible way is to use generating functions and show that the generating function for these walks is ( sum_{k=0}^infty binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} x^k ). But I&#39;m not sure.Alternatively, consider that each walk corresponds to a balanced sequence of U&#39;s and D&#39;s, and the binomial coefficient counts the number of such balanced sequences.Alternatively, here&#39;s a direct combinatorial argument:Each walk that starts with U and never goes below 0 can be associated with a subset of positions (after the first step) where the walk goes U. The constraint is that in any prefix, the number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s. This is equivalent to the number of subsets of size t in the remaining k -1 steps such that t ≥ (k -1 - t) + 1, which simplifies to t ≥ (k)/2. So t ≥ ceil(k/2). Thus, the number of such subsets is ( binom{k -1}{lceil k/2 rceil -1} + binom{k -1}{lceil k/2 rceil} + cdots + binom{k -1}{k -1} ).But this sum is equal to ( binom{k -1}{lfloor (k -1)/2 rfloor} ), due to the properties of binomial coefficients and symmetry. For example, for even k=4, the sum would be ( binom{3}{2} + binom{3}{3} = 3 +1=4 ), which is not equal to ( binom{4}{2}=6 ). So this approach is incorrect.Alternatively, notice that ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ) is also the number of ways to arrange k steps such that there are ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ) D&#39;s and ( lceil k/2 rceil ) U&#39;s, but without any constraints. However, with the constraint of never going below 0, the number is less than this. But in our examples, the numbers coincide. For k=4, the number of unconstrained sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s is ( binom{4}{2}=6 ), which is exactly the number of valid walks. For k=3, the number of unconstrained sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 1 D&#39;s is ( binom{3}{1}=3 ), which again matches.Thus, it appears that the number of valid walks is equal to the number of sequences with ( lceil k/2 rceil ) U&#39;s and ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ) D&#39;s. But why is that?The key insight is that if a walk starts with a U and never goes below 0, then the number of U&#39;s must be at least the number of D&#39;s in every prefix. This implies that the total number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s. However, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the total number of U&#39;s is ( lceil k/2 rceil ). For example, in a walk of length k=4, you can have 3 U&#39;s and 1 D, but such a walk would also be valid. However, our count for k=4 was 6, which is ( binom{4}{2} ), which counts the number of sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. So this suggests that only the balanced sequences are valid, which is not the case.Wait, contradiction: for k=4, there are sequences with 3 U&#39;s and 1 D that are valid. For example, U, U, U, D. Which is valid: positions 0,1,2,3,2. Never goes below 0. But this sequence isn&#39;t counted in ( binom{4}{2} ), which counts sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. But earlier when we counted for k=4, we had 6 sequences, which included both sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s as well as sequences with 3 U&#39;s and 1 D or 4 U&#39;s. Wait, no, for k=4, the array has 5 elements, so k=4 steps: the first step is fixed as U, then there are 3 more steps. So total steps including the first U is 4. Wait, no, the array has k+1 elements, so the number of steps is k. So for k=4, there are 4 steps: starting at a1=0, then a2=1, a3, a4, a5. So steps from a1 to a2 is one step, up to a5 is four steps. Therefore, including the first step, there are four steps: U, then three more steps. So the total number of U&#39;s can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But in our earlier count, there were 6 valid walks. The formula says ( binom{4}{2} =6 ), which counts sequences with 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. But in reality, the valid sequences can have different numbers of U&#39;s and D&#39;s. For example, U, U, U, U (4 U&#39;s) is valid. U, U, U, D (3 U&#39;s, 1 D) is valid. U, U, D, U (3 U&#39;s, 1 D) is valid. U, U, D, D (2 U&#39;s, 2 D&#39;s) is valid. U, D, U, U (3 U&#39;s, 1 D) is valid. U, D, U, D (2 U&#39;s, 2 D&#39;s) is valid. So total valid sequences: 6, which includes sequences with 4 U&#39;s, 3 U&#39;s, and 2 U&#39;s. So the count is not restricted to sequences with exactly ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ) D&#39;s. Therefore, the initial assumption that it&#39;s equal to the central binomial coefficient is incorrect based on this analysis. However, our count shows that for k=4, there are indeed 6 valid sequences, which equals ( binom{4}{2} ), but this counts sequences with exactly 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. However, there are sequences with more U&#39;s that are also valid. Therefore, the initial reasoning must be flawed.Wait, now I&#39;m confused. For k=4, the total number of valid sequences is 6, which is ( binom{4}{2} ). But this includes sequences with 2, 3, or 4 U&#39;s. How is this possible?Wait, no. If k=4, then the number of steps is 4, starting with U. So the remaining 3 steps can be U or D. The total number of U&#39;s in the entire walk is 1 + number of U&#39;s in the remaining 3 steps. The total number of D&#39;s is number of D&#39;s in the remaining 3 steps.The valid walks are:1. U, U, U, U (4 U&#39;s, 0 D&#39;s)2. U, U, U, D (3 U&#39;s, 1 D)3. U, U, D, U (3 U&#39;s, 1 D)4. U, U, D, D (2 U&#39;s, 2 D&#39;s)5. U, D, U, U (3 U&#39;s, 1 D)6. U, D, U, D (2 U&#39;s, 2 D&#39;s)So total of 6 walks. Out of these, two walks have 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s (4 and 6), three walks have 3 U&#39;s and 1 D (2,3,5), and one walk has 4 U&#39;s (1). So the total number of walks is a sum over different possible U and D counts. However, ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ), which counts the number of sequences with exactly 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. But our valid walks include more than that. Therefore, the initial formula seems incorrect, but according to the problem statement, it&#39;s supposed to be exactly ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). This suggests that either my counting is wrong or my understanding is flawed.Wait, wait. The problem says arrays of nonnegative integers such that a_1=0 and |a_i - a_{i+1}|=1 for each i. So the number of such arrays is equal to the number of walks starting at 0, taking k steps (to a_{k+1}), with ±1 increments, never going below 0. The problem claims this is equal to ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). However, according to our count for k=4, there are 6 such walks, which coincides with ( binom{4}{2} =6 ). But when I listed the walks, there were different numbers of U&#39;s and D&#39;s, but the total number is indeed 6, which is the same as the number of sequences with exactly 2 U&#39;s and 2 D&#39;s. But how come the valid walks include sequences with more U&#39;s?Ah, I see now. The count ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ) does not count the number of sequences with exactly ( lfloor k/2 rfloor ) D&#39;s, but rather counts the number of sequences where the number of U&#39;s is at least the number of D&#39;s in every prefix. However, in reality, this is not the same as the central binomial coefficient, but in our examples, it coincidentally matches. However, according to the problem statement, this is supposed to hold for all k.This suggests that there is a deeper combinatorial identity at play here. Upon reflection, I recall that the number of walks of length k starting at 0, taking ±1 steps, and never dipping below 0 is indeed equal to ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ). This is a known result, and one way to see it is by using generating functions or the reflection principle to show that the number of such walks is equal to the central binomial coefficient.However, since I need to prove this, let&#39;s try to formalize the reflection principle argument.Let’s consider all walks of length k starting at 0, with steps ±1, never going below 0. We want to show that the number of such walks is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).First, the total number of unrestricted walks starting at 0 is ( 2^k ). Each walk corresponds to a sequence of U&#39;s and D&#39;s.Now, to count the number of walks that never go below 0, we can use the reflection principle. The key idea is that for each walk that does go below 0, we can reflect it across the first point where it dips below 0, creating a bijection with walks that start with a D step.Formally, let’s denote a bad walk as one that dips below 0 at some point. For each bad walk, there is a first time it reaches -1. Reflect the walk from that point onwards, changing D&#39;s to U&#39;s and vice versa. This reflected walk will start at 0, first step U, and end at a different position. However, the exact bijection might be more complex.Alternatively, use the following argument from the André reflection method: The number of walks from 0 to x in k steps that never dip below 0 is equal to ( binom{k}{(k + x)/2} - binom{k}{(k + x)/2 + 1} ). For x ≥ 0.In our case, we want walks that end anywhere, as long as they never go below 0. So the total number is the sum over x ≥ 0 of ( binom{k}{(k + x)/2} - binom{k}{(k + x)/2 + 1} ).But summing this over all x ≥ 0 such that (k + x) is even gives us the total number of such walks. This sum telescopes:Sum_{x ≥ 0} [ binom{k}{(k + x)/2} - binom{k}{(k + x)/2 + 1} ] = binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} .This is because the terms cancel out in pairs, leaving only the first term when x is minimal, which corresponds to the largest binomial coefficient.Therefore, the number of walks of length k starting at 0, taking ±1 steps, and never dipping below 0 is ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ).Hence, the number of such arrays is indeed ( binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} ), as required.Final AnswerThe number of such arrays is boxed{dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}}.&lt;/think&gt;To prove that there are exactly (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}) arrays (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1}) of nonnegative integers such that (a_1 = 0) and (|a_i - a_{i+1}| = 1) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, k), we can model the problem as a restricted walk starting at 0, taking steps of +1 or -1, and never going below 0.1. Understanding the Problem:   - The array starts at 0, and each subsequent term differs by exactly 1.   - The walk must never go below 0, which means each step from 0 must be +1.2. Small Cases Verification:   - For (k = 1), there is 1 valid array: ([0, 1]).   - For (k = 2), there are 2 valid arrays: ([0, 1, 0]) and ([0, 1, 2]).   - For (k = 3), there are 3 valid arrays: ([0, 1, 0, 1]), ([0, 1, 2, 1]), and ([0, 1, 2, 3]).   - These results match the binomial coefficients (binom{1}{0}), (binom{2}{1}), and (binom{3}{1}).3. General Case Analysis:   - The problem is equivalent to counting walks of length (k) starting at 0, taking steps ±1, and never going below 0.   - Using the reflection principle, the number of such walks is known to be the central binomial coefficient (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).4. Reflection Principle:   - The reflection principle is used to count the number of valid walks by transforming invalid walks (those that go below 0) into valid ones.   - The key insight is that the number of valid walks starting at 0 and never dipping below 0 is given by the largest binomial coefficient (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).5. Conclusion:   - The number of valid arrays is equivalent to the number of such walks, which is (binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}).Thus, the number of arrays (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1}) is (boxed{dbinom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-276ea2c2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>🔑:</span>To prove that there are exactly binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} arrays a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{k+1} of nonnegative integers such that a_1 = 0 and |a_i - a_{i+1}| = 1 for i = 1, 2, ldots, k, we will use a combinatorial argument and recursion.1. Define the problem in terms of sequences:   Let A(k) be the number of such sequences of length k+1 starting with a_1 = 0.   Let B(k) be the number of such sequences of length k+1 starting with a_1 = 0 and ending with a_{k+1} = 0.2. Establish the recursion:   To compute A(k+1), consider the value of a_{k+1}:   - If a_{k+1} neq 0, then a_{k+2} can be either a_{k+1} + 1 or a_{k+1} - 1.   - If a_{k+1} = 0, then a_{k+2} can only be 1.   Therefore, we have:   [   A(k+1) = B(k) + 2(A(k) - B(k)) = 2A(k) - B(k)   ]3. Analyze B(k):   - If k+1 is odd, then B(k) = 0 because it is impossible to return to 0 in an odd number of steps.   - If k+1 is even, then B(k) is the frac{k}{2}-th Catalan number, C_{frac{k}{2}}.4. Catalan numbers and binomial coefficients:   The n-th Catalan number is given by:   [   C_n = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n}   ]5. Induction proof:   We will use induction to prove that A(k) = binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}.   Base case:   For k = 0, A(0) = 1 because the only sequence is a_1 = 0. This matches binom{0}{0} = 1.   Inductive step:   Assume A(k) = binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} for some k geq 0. We need to show that A(k+1) = binom{k+1}{lfloor (k+1)/2 rfloor}.   Using the recursion:   [   A(k+1) = 2A(k) - B(k)   ]   - If k+1 is odd, then B(k) = 0, so:     [     A(k+1) = 2A(k) = 2 binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}     ]     Since k+1 is odd, lfloor (k+1)/2 rfloor = lfloor k/2 rfloor + 1. Therefore:     [     binom{k+1}{lfloor (k+1)/2 rfloor} = 2 binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}     ]   - If k+1 is even, then B(k) = C_{frac{k}{2}}, so:     [     A(k+1) = 2A(k) - C_{frac{k}{2}}     ]     Using the inductive hypothesis and the definition of Catalan numbers:     [     A(k+1) = 2 binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} - frac{1}{frac{k}{2} + 1} binom{k}{frac{k}{2}}     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     A(k+1) = binom{k+1}{lfloor (k+1)/2 rfloor}     ]   Thus, by induction, A(k) = binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor} for all k geq 0.The final answer is boxed{binom{k}{lfloor k/2 rfloor}}</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-2fed70db data-v-276ea2c2><div class="review" data-v-276ea2c2><div class="review-title" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>❓:</span>Problem 3.6.

So, Petya can draw four things: the sun, a ball, a tomato, and a banana. Each of these has certain properties related to being yellow, round, or edible. The problem states that there are exactly 15 yellow things, 18 round things, and 13 edible things. We need to find the maximum number of balls he could have drawn. First, let&#39;s list out the properties of each item based on Petya&#39;s beliefs:- Sun: I assume the sun is yellow and round. But wait, the problem doesn&#39;t explicitly say so. Hmm. Wait, actually, the problem says that Petya believes all tomatoes are round and red, all balls are round and can be any color, and all bananas are yellow and not round. It doesn&#39;t mention the sun&#39;s properties. Wait, that&#39;s a problem. The problem says &quot;Petya can draw only 4 things: the sun, a ball, a tomato, and a banana.&quot; But then it says he believes certain things about tomatoes, balls, and bananas. But there&#39;s no mention of the sun&#39;s properties. So maybe we need to infer the sun&#39;s properties from common sense? Or is it given in the problem?Wait, let me check again. The problem says: &quot;Petya believes that all tomatoes are round and red, all balls are round and can be of any color, and all bananas are yellow and not round.&quot; So, nothing about the sun. But the sun is one of the things he draws. Since the problem mentions &quot;yellow, round, and edible&quot; as the three categories, we need to know for each of the four items (sun, ball, tomato, banana) which of these categories they fall into.Given that bananas are yellow and not round, tomatoes are round and red (so not yellow), and balls are round and can be any color. So the sun&#39;s properties are not explicitly given. Hmm. Since the sun is a separate item, and the problem mentions that there are yellow things, which could be bananas and possibly the sun. Similarly, the sun might be round. So we need to figure out the sun&#39;s properties. Maybe the sun is both yellow and round? That seems logical. Also, in terms of edibility, which items are edible? The problem says &quot;13 edible.&quot; So which of the four items are considered edible? Bananas and tomatoes are edible. Balls are not edible. The sun is not edible. So tomatoes and bananas are edible. So the edible count would be tomatoes plus bananas.Wait, let&#39;s confirm:- Tomatoes: round, red (so not yellow), edible.- Balls: round, any color (so could be yellow or not), not edible.- Bananas: yellow, not round, edible.- Sun: Hmm, not specified. But since the sun is an object he draws, we need to figure out its properties. If the sun is considered yellow and round, then it would contribute to both yellow and round counts. Also, since the sun is not edible, it doesn&#39;t contribute to the edible count. So let&#39;s note the properties:1. Sun: Assuming yellow and round (common sense), not edible.2. Ball: Round, color can be any (so could be yellow or not), not edible.3. Tomato: Round, red (so not yellow), edible.4. Banana: Yellow, not round, edible.So edible items are tomatoes and bananas. Yellow items are bananas and sun. Round items are sun, ball, tomato. Given that, the total counts:- Yellow: suns + bananas- Round: suns + balls + tomatoes- Edible: bananas + tomatoesWe have exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible. We need to find the maximum number of balls.Let’s denote variables:Let S = number of suns,B = number of balls,T = number of tomatoes,N = number of bananas.We need to maximize B, given:1. Yellow: S + N = 152. Round: S + B + T = 183. Edible: T + N = 13All variables S, B, T, N are non-negative integers.We need to solve these equations to maximize B.So, let&#39;s write the equations:From equation 3: T + N = 13 ⇒ T = 13 - NFrom equation 1: S = 15 - NFrom equation 2: S + B + T = 18. Substitute S and T from above:(15 - N) + B + (13 - N) = 18Simplify:15 - N + B + 13 - N = 1828 - 2N + B = 18So, B = 18 - 28 + 2NB = -10 + 2NTherefore, B = 2N - 10But since B must be non-negative, 2N - 10 ≥ 0 ⇒ 2N ≥ 10 ⇒ N ≥ 5Also, since T = 13 - N, T must be non-negative ⇒ 13 - N ≥ 0 ⇒ N ≤ 13Similarly, S = 15 - N must be non-negative ⇒ 15 - N ≥ 0 ⇒ N ≤ 15But from T, N ≤13, so N can be from 5 to 13 inclusive.Now, since B = 2N -10, to maximize B, we need to maximize N. Since N can go up to 13, then maximum B would be 2*13 -10 = 26 -10 = 16.But let&#39;s check if this is possible. If N=13, then:T = 13 -13=0S=15 -13=2Then Round: S + B + T =2 + B +0=2 + B=18 ⇒ B=16. So yes, that&#39;s possible.But check if all variables are non-negative:S=2, B=16, T=0, N=13. All non-negative. So that&#39;s okay.But wait, T=0 is allowed? The problem says &quot;he drew several things, among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot; It doesn&#39;t say he has to draw at least one of each. So T can be zero. So this seems acceptable.Therefore, maximum number of balls is 16. Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify the counts:Yellow: S + N =2 +13=15 (correct)Round: S + B + T=2 +16 +0=18 (correct)Edible: T + N=0 +13=13 (correct)All counts are satisfied, so this works.But let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another constraint. For example, the problem says &quot;he drew several things,&quot; but maybe &quot;several&quot; implies more than one? But even if so, in this case, he drew S=2 suns, B=16 balls, N=13 bananas. So total drawings would be 2+16+0+13=31, which is certainly several. So no problem.But wait, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, it says &quot;he drew several things, among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot; So these counts are overlapping. For example, a banana is yellow and edible but not round, a tomato is round and edible but not yellow, a ball is round but not edible (unless the ball is edible? Wait, the problem says &quot;13 edible.&quot; Which items are edible? From the problem statement:&quot;Petya believes that all tomatoes are round and red, all balls are round and can be of any color, and all bananas are yellow and not round.&quot;So, does that imply tomatoes are edible? Bananas are edible? The problem mentions &quot;edible&quot; as a category. So presumably, tomatoes and bananas are considered edible, while sun and ball are not. That makes sense because in real life, tomatoes and bananas are edible, sun and balls are not. So the edible count is tomatoes plus bananas.Therefore, in our equations, T + N =13. So, with N=13 and T=0, that&#39;s 13 edible bananas. Okay, but can we have T=0? The problem doesn&#39;t state that he drew all types; he just drew &quot;several things&quot; which can include any number of the four types, including zero. So T=0 is allowed.Similarly, S=2 is allowed. So all constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 16.But let me check if there&#39;s another interpretation. For example, maybe the sun is not considered edible, but maybe the problem counts edibility differently? Wait, the problem says &quot;13 edible.&quot; So which items are edible? From the problem statement:- Tomatoes: round and red. The problem doesn&#39;t explicitly say they&#39;re edible, but in reality, tomatoes are edible. Similarly, bananas are edible. Balls and sun are not. So I think the problem assumes that tomatoes and bananas are edible. So T + N =13 is correct.Similarly, sun is yellow and round. If we have S suns, they contribute to yellow and round. Balls are round, and can be of any color. So if a ball is yellow, it would contribute to both yellow and round. Wait a minute! Wait, hold on. I think this is a key point I missed earlier.The problem says &quot;he drew several things, among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot;So the counts are for the total number of yellow things, round things, and edible things. Each item can belong to multiple categories. For example, a banana is yellow and edible but not round. A tomato is round and edible but not yellow. A ball is round, and can be yellow or not. The sun is yellow and round but not edible.Therefore, when considering the counts:- Each banana contributes 1 to yellow and 1 to edible.- Each tomato contributes 1 to round and 1 to edible.- Each ball contributes 1 to round. If a ball is yellow, it also contributes 1 to yellow. Otherwise, it doesn&#39;t.- Each sun contributes 1 to yellow and 1 to round.Therefore, the previous equations might not capture the full picture because balls can be yellow or not. Therefore, the number of yellow items is not just S + N, but S + N + YB, where YB is the number of yellow balls. Similarly, the round items are S + B + T, since all balls are round (regardless of color), all suns are round, all tomatoes are round, bananas are not round.But wait, the problem says &quot;all balls are round and can be of any color.&quot; So balls are always round, but their color can vary. So each ball is round, and may or may not be yellow. So if a ball is yellow, it contributes to both yellow and round. If it&#39;s not yellow, it only contributes to round.Similarly, the sun is yellow and round, so each sun contributes to both yellow and round. Bananas are yellow and not round, so each banana contributes to yellow and edible. Tomatoes are round and edible but not yellow, so each tomato contributes to round and edible.Therefore, the counts are:- Yellow: suns + bananas + yellow balls- Round: suns + balls + tomatoes- Edible: bananas + tomatoesBut in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that there are exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible. So we have to set up the equations accordingly.Let me redefine variables:Let S = number of suns (yellow and round)B = total number of balls (all round, some may be yellow)Let YB = number of yellow ballsSo, the total number of balls is B, and YB ≤ BT = number of tomatoes (round and edible)N = number of bananas (yellow and edible)Now, the equations:1. Yellow: S + N + YB =152. Round: S + B + T =183. Edible: T + N =13We need to maximize B.But we also have that YB ≤ BSo, let&#39;s see. To maximize B, we need to minimize the other variables that consume the counts. Let&#39;s see how.From equation 3: T + N =13. So T =13 - NFrom equation 2: S + B + T =18 ⇒ S + B + (13 - N) =18 ⇒ S + B =18 -13 + N ⇒ S + B =5 + N ⇒ S =5 + N - BFrom equation 1: S + N + YB =15. Substitute S from above: (5 + N - B) + N + YB =15 ⇒5 + N - B + N + YB =15 ⇒5 + 2N - B + YB =15 ⇒2N - B + YB =10But since YB is the number of yellow balls, which is ≤ B, so YB ≤ B. So we can write YB = B - RB where RB is the number of non-yellow (red?) balls. But since balls can be any color, but yellow or non-yellow. So YB = B - RB, but RB ≥0. So YB ≤ B.Alternatively, express 2N - B + YB =10. Since YB can be at most B, then 2N - B + YB ≤2N - B + B =2N. Therefore, 2N ≥10 ⇒ N ≥5, as before.But to maximize B, we need to maximize N because B is 2N -10 + YB. Wait, let&#39;s see:Wait, from the equation 2N - B + YB =10, rearranged: B =2N + YB -10.Since YB can be up to B, but B is expressed in terms of YB. Hmm, this seems a bit circular.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider that YB can be at most B. So, in the equation 2N - B + YB =10, since YB ≤ B, then 2N - B + B =2N ≥10 ⇒N ≥5. But also, the maximum possible value of YB is B, so plugging YB=B into the equation:2N - B + B =2N=10 ⇒N=5. So if YB=B, then N=5. But this gives B=2*5 + B -10 ⇒0=0. Wait, this might not help.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s express YB from the equation:YB =10 -2N + BBut since YB ≥0:10 -2N + B ≥0 ⇒B ≥2N -10Also, YB ≤B ⇒10 -2N + B ≤B ⇒10 -2N ≤0 ⇒2N ≥10 ⇒N ≥5So N ≥5, and B ≥2N -10.But we need to maximize B. To do that, let&#39;s consider the variables:We have:From equation 3: T =13 -NFrom equation 2: S =5 +N -BBut S must be ≥0 ⇒5 +N -B ≥0 ⇒B ≤5 +NSo B ≤5 +N and B ≥2N -10Therefore, 2N -10 ≤B ≤5 +NTo maximize B, set B =5 +N, provided that 5 +N ≥2N -10 ⇒5 +N ≥2N -10 ⇒5 +10 ≥2N -N ⇒15 ≥NSince N can be up to 13 (because T =13 -N ≥0 ⇒N ≤13), then for N=13, B=5+13=18. But check if that works.If B=5 +N, then from equation YB=10 -2N + B=10 -2N +5 +N=15 -NBut YB must be ≤B=5 +N, so 15 -N ≤5 +N ⇒15 -5 ≤N +N ⇒10 ≤2N ⇒N ≥5Which is already satisfied. Also, YB=15 -N must be ≥0 ⇒15 -N ≥0 ⇒N ≤15, which is already satisfied since N ≤13.So for N=13, YB=15 -13=2. Then B=5+13=18. Check if YB=2 ≤B=18, which is true.But we also need to check S=5 +N -B=5 +13 -18=0. So S=0, which is allowed.Let&#39;s verify all counts:Yellow: S + N + YB=0 +13 +2=15 (correct)Round: S + B + T=0 +18 + (13 -13)=0 +18 +0=18 (correct)Edible: T + N=0 +13=13 (correct)So this works. So in this case, B=18.Wait, but earlier when we considered the sun, we had S=2 and B=16. But here, S=0 and B=18. Which is a higher B. So why the discrepancy?Because in the initial analysis, I assumed that all yellow items are suns and bananas, but balls can also contribute to yellow. So if we allow balls to be yellow, then we can have more balls by reducing the number of suns and bananas, but increasing the number of yellow balls.So the key was to recognize that balls can be yellow, so they can contribute to both yellow and round counts, allowing us to replace some suns and bananas with yellow balls, thus freeing up the counts to allow more balls.So this changes the equations. Therefore, the correct approach is to model YB as part of the yellow count.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 18, when S=0, N=13, YB=2, T=0. But wait, T=13 -N=0.But if T=0, then there are no tomatoes. But the problem doesn&#39;t require having tomatoes. So that&#39;s okay.But wait, how can YB=2 when B=18? That means there are 2 yellow balls and 16 non-yellow balls. But since balls can be any color, this is acceptable.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 18.But wait, in this case, all the yellow items are bananas (13) and yellow balls (2), totaling 15. All the round items are balls (18) and suns (0) and tomatoes (0), totaling 18. All the edible items are bananas (13) and tomatoes (0), totaling 13. So this works.But earlier, when we didn&#39;t consider yellow balls, we had S=2, B=16, N=13, T=0. But that gives yellow as S + N=15, which is okay, but since balls can be yellow, we can convert some suns into non-suns and have some yellow balls instead, thus increasing the number of balls.So by setting S=0, we can have more balls. Because each sun contributes 1 to yellow and 1 to round. If we replace a sun with a ball, but make that ball yellow, we can keep the yellow count the same while increasing the ball count. For example, replacing 1 sun with 1 yellow ball: yellow count remains the same (1 sun →1 yellow ball), round count also remains the same (1 sun →1 ball), but the ball count increases by 1. Wait, but in this case, if you replace a sun with a yellow ball, you actually don&#39;t increase the ball count; you just replace one round yellow object (sun) with another round yellow object (ball). So total balls would stay the same. Hmm, maybe that&#39;s not the way.Wait, perhaps another way. Let&#39;s think of it as follows: If we have a sun, it takes up a yellow and a round slot. If we can instead have a yellow ball, which also takes up a yellow and a round slot, but since balls can be non-yellow, maybe we can have some balls that are non-yellow and thus free up the yellow count for other items like bananas.Wait, let&#39;s take the previous solution where S=0, N=13, B=18, YB=2. So the yellow count is 13 bananas +2 yellow balls=15. The round count is 18 balls. The edible count is 13 bananas. So in this case, we have no suns, 18 balls (2 yellow, 16 non-yellow), 13 bananas, and 0 tomatoes. This satisfies all the counts.Alternatively, if we have some suns, say S=2, then the yellow count would be S + N + YB=2 + N + YB=15. The round count would be S + B + T=2 + B + T=18. The edible count is N + T=13. Let&#39;s say we set T=0, then N=13. Then yellow count is 2 +13 + YB=15 ⇒ YB=0. So we have 2 suns, 0 yellow balls, 13 bananas, and B=18 -2 -0=16 balls. So in this case, the balls are all non-yellow. This gives 16 balls.But in the other case, without suns, we can have 18 balls (2 yellow and 16 non-yellow). So by eliminating suns, we can have more balls. Because each sun takes up a yellow and a round slot. If we remove a sun, we can add a non-yellow ball (which only takes a round slot) and add a yellow banana (which takes a yellow and edible slot). But wait, bananas are also edible. So maybe not directly.But in the scenario with S=0, we can have more balls because we don&#39;t use up the yellow slots on suns. Instead, we use bananas for yellow and edible, and use yellow balls to reach the required yellow count. So for example, each banana is 1 yellow and 1 edible. Each yellow ball is 1 yellow and 1 round. So by using bananas for edible and some yellow, and yellow balls for the remaining yellow, we can maximize the number of balls.In the case of S=0, N=13, YB=2:- Bananas provide 13 yellow and 13 edible.- Yellow balls provide 2 yellow and 2 round.But we need 15 yellow, so 13 +2=15.Round count needs to be 18. Balls are 18 (2 yellow and 16 non-yellow). So round count is 18.Edible count is 13 (all bananas).So this works. Therefore, by not having any suns or tomatoes, and using bananas for edible and yellow, and yellow balls for the remaining yellow, we can have 18 balls.But is this allowed? The problem says he drew several things. There&#39;s no restriction on having to draw all four types. So drawing only balls and bananas is allowed.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 18.Wait, but this contradicts the initial answer of 16 when we didn&#39;t consider yellow balls. So the key was realizing that balls can be yellow, thereby contributing to the yellow count, allowing us to have more balls by converting some suns into balls (both round) and compensating the yellow count with bananas and yellow balls.Therefore, the correct answer is 18.But let&#39;s check again:If S=0, B=18, T=0, N=13, YB=2.Yellow: 0 +13 +2=15.Round:0 +18 +0=18.Edible:0 +13=13.Yes, all counts are satisfied.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 18.But I need to verify if this is correct. Let&#39;s consider another case. Suppose N=5, then from equation 3, T=8.From equation 2: S + B +8=18 ⇒S + B=10.From equation 1: S +5 + YB=15 ⇒S + YB=10.Also, YB ≤ B.So S=10 -B.So YB=10 -S=10 - (10 -B)=B.So YB=B.Therefore, in this case, B can be at most ... Well, since S=10 - B ≥0 ⇒B ≤10.And YB=B.So for example, if B=10, then S=0, YB=10.Check counts:Yellow:0 +5 +10=15.Round:0 +10 +8=18.Edible:8 +5=13.This works. Here, we have 10 balls (all yellow), 0 suns, 8 tomatoes, 5 bananas.But here, the number of balls is 10, which is less than 18. So 18 is better.Similarly, if we take N=10, then T=3.From equation 2: S + B +3=18 ⇒S + B=15.From equation 1: S +10 + YB=15 ⇒S + YB=5.Also, S=15 - B.So YB=5 - (15 - B)=B -10.Since YB ≥0 ⇒B -10 ≥0 ⇒B ≥10.Also, YB ≤B ⇒B -10 ≤B ⇒-10 ≤0, which is always true.So B can be from 10 to15.For maximum B=15:S=15 -15=0.YB=15 -10=5.Check counts:Yellow:0 +10 +5=15.Round:0 +15 +3=18.Edible:3 +10=13.This works. Here, B=15, which is more than the previous case but still less than 18.Therefore, the maximum B occurs when N=13, leading to B=18.Therefore, the answer is 18.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s any constraint we missed. For example, does the problem imply that each drawing is a single object? Yes, he drew several things, each of which is one of the four types. So each object is either a sun, ball, tomato, or banana. So the counts are separate: total yellow objects (could be suns, bananas, or yellow balls), total round objects (suns, balls, tomatoes), total edible objects (bananas, tomatoes). The variables are the counts of each object.Therefore, the solution where we have 18 balls (2 yellow, 16 non-yellow), 13 bananas, and 0 suns and 0 tomatoes satisfies all the conditions.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is 18.But wait, the problem says &quot;he drew several things&quot;, which could be interpreted as multiple items, but even if he drew 18 balls and 13 bananas, that&#39;s 31 things, which is several. So no problem.But the question is, in the problem statement, it says &quot;he drew several things, among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot;So the total number of things he drew is at least 15 (since there are 15 yellow), but since some items can be in multiple categories, the total number could be more. But in the case of S=0, B=18, T=0, N=13, the total number of items is 18 +13=31. The yellow count is 15 (13 bananas +2 balls), round count is 18 (all balls), edible count is13 (all bananas). So overlapping counts are considered correctly.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 18.But let&#39;s check once more. The key was realizing that balls can be yellow, allowing us to use some balls to contribute to the yellow count, thus reducing the need for suns and bananas. By eliminating suns and tomatoes completely, and using bananas for edible and part of yellow, and yellow balls for the remaining yellow, we can maximize the number of balls.Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be 18.Final AnswerThe maximum number of balls Petya could have drawn is boxed{18}.&lt;/think&gt;Petya can draw four things: the sun, a ball, a tomato, and a banana. The properties of these items are as follows:- Sun: yellow and round, not edible.- Ball: round, can be any color, not edible.- Tomato: round, red (not yellow), edible.- Banana: yellow, not round, edible.We need to determine the maximum number of balls given there are exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible items.Key equations based on the problem statement:1. Yellow items: suns (S) + bananas (N) + yellow balls (YB) = 152. Round items: suns (S) + balls (B) + tomatoes (T) = 183. Edible items: tomatoes (T) + bananas (N) = 13We aim to maximize the number of balls (B). From the edible items equation:[ T + N = 13 implies T = 13 - N ]Substitute ( T ) into the round items equation:[ S + B + (13 - N) = 18 implies S + B = 5 + N implies S = 5 + N - B ]Substitute ( S ) into the yellow items equation:[ (5 + N - B) + N + YB = 15 implies 5 + 2N - B + YB = 15 implies 2N - B + YB = 10 ]Since ( YB leq B ), we can express ( YB ) as ( 10 - 2N + B ). To maximize ( B ), we need to maximize ( N ). The maximum value of ( N ) is 13 (since ( T = 13 - N ) must be non-negative).Substitute ( N = 13 ):[ T = 13 - 13 = 0 ][ S = 5 + 13 - B ][ 2 times 13 - B + YB = 10 implies 26 - B + YB = 10 implies YB = B - 16 ]Since ( YB leq B ), ( B - 16 geq 0 implies B geq 16 ). However, substituting ( N = 13 ) into ( S ):[ S = 5 + 13 - B = 18 - B ]For ( S geq 0 ), ( B leq 18 ).Setting ( B = 18 ):[ YB = 18 - 16 = 2 ][ S = 18 - 18 = 0 ]Verification:- Yellow: ( S + N + YB = 0 + 13 + 2 = 15 )- Round: ( S + B + T = 0 + 18 + 0 = 18 )- Edible: ( T + N = 0 + 13 = 13 )All conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the maximum number of balls is (boxed{18}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. So, Petya can draw four things: the sun, a ball, a tomato, and a banana. Each of these has certain properties related to color and shape. The problem states that he drew several things with exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible items. We need to find the maximum number of balls he could have drawn. First, let me list out the properties of each item as per Petya&#39;s beliefs:- Sun: The problem doesn&#39;t specify the sun&#39;s properties, but since it&#39;s a separate item, we need to infer. Since the other items are yellow, round, or edible, maybe the sun is yellow and round? But the problem says &quot;extremely realistically,&quot; so let&#39;s think. The sun is typically depicted as yellow and round, right? So maybe the sun is both yellow and round. Also, is the sun edible? Probably not, so the sun is not edible. So sun: yellow, round, not edible.- Ball: Balls are round and can be of any color. So a ball contributes to the round count. The color can vary, so it could be yellow or not. But since we need maximum balls, maybe we can make some balls yellow to contribute to the yellow count? But we have to be careful not to overlap too much if that reduces the total.- Tomato: All tomatoes are round and red. So tomatoes contribute to the round count but not to yellow. They are edible, right? So tomato: round, red, edible.- Banana: Bananas are yellow and not round. They are also edible. So banana: yellow, not round, edible.Given that, let&#39;s note the contributions each item makes to the counts:- Sun: Yellow (1), Round (1), Not edible (0)- Ball: Round (1), Color can be yellow or not, Not edible (assuming a ball isn&#39;t edible)- Tomato: Round (1), Red (not yellow), Edible (1)- Banana: Yellow (1), Not round (0), Edible (1)Wait, but the problem mentions there are 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible. So each of these counts is the total from all the drawn items.Our goal is to maximize the number of balls, so we need to structure the counts such that as many round items as possible are balls, while satisfying the yellow and edible constraints.But first, let&#39;s confirm the edibility:- The problem doesn&#39;t state whether the sun or the ball are edible, but since tomatoes and bananas are edible, and the counts are given as &quot;edible,&quot; we can assume that only tomatoes and bananas contribute to the edible count. Wait, the problem says &quot;13 edible.&quot; So tomatoes and bananas are edible, sun and ball are not. That makes sense because tomatoes and bananas are food items, while sun and ball are not. So:- Sun: Not edible- Ball: Not edible- Tomato: Edible- Banana: EdibleTherefore, the edible count comes only from tomatoes and bananas. So tomatoes + bananas = 13.But also, bananas are yellow and not round. So bananas contribute to the yellow count but not the round count.Tomatoes contribute to the round count but not the yellow count.Suns contribute to both yellow and round counts.Balls contribute to the round count, and could contribute to yellow count if they are yellow. However, if we want to maximize the number of balls, we need to see if making balls yellow would help or hurt. Since yellow is a separate count, if we have too many yellow items from bananas and suns, then we might not need yellow balls. Alternatively, if we can use yellow balls to cover both the round and yellow counts, that might allow us to have more balls. So perhaps it&#39;s a balance.Let&#39;s define variables:Let S = number of sunsB = number of ballsT = number of tomatoesN = number of bananasWe need to find the maximum B such that:Yellow: S + N + (number of yellow balls) = 15Round: S + B + T = 18Edible: T + N = 13But the problem says &quot;he drew several things, among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot; So each drawn item can contribute to multiple counts. For example, a sun is both yellow and round, a banana is yellow and edible, a tomato is round and edible, and a ball is round. The color of the ball can be yellow or not, but the problem says &quot;there were exactly 15 yellow.&quot; So if a ball is yellow, then it contributes to the yellow count; if not, it doesn&#39;t. However, the problem doesn&#39;t specify the color of the balls, so we can choose some balls to be yellow and others not. To maximize the number of balls, perhaps we want to maximize the number of balls that can contribute to the yellow count, so that we don&#39;t need as many suns or bananas. Wait, but bananas are already contributing to yellow and edible. Since bananas are required for the edible count, and each banana gives 1 yellow, we need to have N bananas, each contributing 1 yellow and 1 edible. Similarly, tomatoes contribute 1 round and 1 edible each. Suns contribute 1 yellow and 1 round each. Balls contribute 1 round each, and can contribute 1 yellow each if they are yellow.Since edible is T + N = 13, and we need to have T and N such that. So T = 13 - N. Therefore, the number of tomatoes is dependent on the number of bananas. Since tomatoes are round, they contribute to the round count, and bananas are not round.Now, let&#39;s write the equations again:Yellow: S + N + Y = 15, where Y is the number of yellow balls.Round: S + B + T = 18But since T = 13 - N, substitute T:Round: S + B + (13 - N) = 18 =&gt; S + B - N = 5Also, from Yellow: S + N + Y = 15. Since Y can be at most B (if all balls are yellow), but we might not need all balls to be yellow. To maximize B, we might want to minimize the number of yellow balls, because if we can get the yellow count from other sources, then we can have more balls. But wait, actually, if we make balls yellow, they can contribute to both round and yellow, which might allow us to have more balls. Wait, this is a bit conflicting.Wait, if we make a ball yellow, it can contribute to both yellow and round. So if we have a yellow ball, that&#39;s one yellow and one round. If instead of a yellow ball, we have a non-yellow ball, then we need another item to cover the yellow count, which could be a sun or a banana. But bananas are already contributing to edible. So perhaps it&#39;s better to have as many yellow balls as possible to cover both yellow and round, thereby reducing the need for suns or bananas. Wait, but bananas are necessary for the edible count. Let&#39;s think.Our goal is to maximize B (number of balls). Let&#39;s see. To maximize B, we need to see how the constraints interact.First, from the edible count: T + N = 13. Therefore, T = 13 - N. Since both T and N have to be non-negative integers, N can range from 0 to 13.From the round count: S + B + T = 18. Since T = 13 - N, substitute:S + B + 13 - N = 18 =&gt; S + B - N = 5.From the yellow count: S + N + Y = 15, where Y is the number of yellow balls (Y ≤ B).We need to find the maximum possible B, given these equations. Let&#39;s try to express variables in terms of others.From S + B - N = 5, we can express S = 5 - B + N.Plugging this into the yellow equation:(5 - B + N) + N + Y = 15 =&gt; 5 - B + 2N + Y = 15 =&gt; -B + 2N + Y = 10.But Y ≤ B, so Y can be at most B. To maximize B, we need to maximize Y, but we have Y = B - (something). Wait, let&#39;s rearrange the equation:From -B + 2N + Y = 10 =&gt; Y = B - 2N + 10.But since Y ≤ B, this implies:B - 2N + 10 ≤ B =&gt; -2N + 10 ≤ 0 =&gt; -2N ≤ -10 =&gt; 2N ≥ 10 =&gt; N ≥ 5.So N must be at least 5. Also, since N can be at most 13 (from T + N =13), N ranges from 5 to 13.Moreover, since Y must be non-negative:Y = B - 2N + 10 ≥ 0 =&gt; B ≥ 2N -10.So B must be at least 2N -10. But since B must be non-negative, 2N -10 ≤ B. Given that N ≥5, 2*5 -10=0, so B ≥0, which is okay.But we need to express B in terms of N. Let&#39;s recall that S =5 - B + N.But S must also be non-negative: 5 - B + N ≥0 =&gt; B ≤5 + N.So B ≤ N +5.Also, from the yellow count equation: Y = B -2N +10. Since Y ≥0, B ≥2N -10.So combining these:2N -10 ≤ B ≤ N +5.But also, N is between 5 and13.Our goal is to maximize B. So for each possible N from 5 to13, compute the maximum possible B, which is N +5. Then check if B = N +5 satisfies B ≥2N -10.Wait, let&#39;s see:If B = N +5, then check if N +5 ≥2N -10:N +5 ≥2N -105 +10 ≥2N -N15 ≥NWhich is true because N ≤13.So for each N from5 to13, the maximum possible B is N +5. But we also need to ensure that Y = B -2N +10 is non-negative. Since B = N +5,Y = (N +5) -2N +10 = -N +15.Since N ≥5, Y = -N +15 must be ≥0:- N +15 ≥0 =&gt; N ≤15, which is already true since N ≤13.Thus, Y = -N +15 is non-negative for N ≤15, which holds here.But Y also must be ≤ B = N +5. So check:Y = -N +15 ≤ N +5- N +15 ≤ N +515 -5 ≤ 2N10 ≤2NN ≥5Which is exactly our starting condition. So that holds.Therefore, for each N from5 to13, the maximum B is N +5, and Y = -N +15.But we need to ensure that S =5 - B +N is non-negative. Since B =N +5,S =5 - (N +5) +N =5 -N -5 +N=0.So S=0.Wait, so if we set B =N +5, then S=0. That is possible.So S is zero. So all the suns are zero. That might be possible.Let me check this again.Given:From round equation:S + B -N =5If S=0, then B -N =5 =&gt; B =N +5.Yes.So if we set S=0, then B =N +5.From yellow equation:S +N + Y =15 =&gt;0 +N + Y=15 =&gt; Y=15 -N.But Y is the number of yellow balls, which is also B -2N +10 from earlier.Wait, but according to Y = B -2N +10, and B =N +5,Y = (N +5) -2N +10 = -N +15, which is the same as Y=15 -N.So yes, consistent.Therefore, if we set S=0, then B =N +5, Y=15 -N, and T=13 -N.But we need to make sure that the number of yellow balls Y=15 -N is less than or equal to B=N +5.So 15 -N ≤N +515 -5 ≤2N10 ≤2NN ≥5, which holds.Also, Y must be non-negative:15 -N ≥0 =&gt;N ≤15, which holds since N ≤13.Additionally, T=13 -N must be non-negative:13 -N ≥0 =&gt;N ≤13, which is already the case.So all constraints are satisfied if we set S=0, B=N +5, Y=15 -N, T=13 -N, where N ranges from5 to13.But we need to find the maximum B. Since B =N +5, to maximize B, we need to maximize N. The maximum N is13.If N=13,Then B=13 +5=18But check T=13 -13=0. So T=0. That&#39;s okay.Y=15 -13=2. So 2 yellow balls.But B=18, Y=2. So out of 18 balls, 2 are yellow and 16 are non-yellow.But is that allowed? The problem says &quot;balls can be of any color,&quot; so yes, we can have some yellow and some non-yellow.So total items drawn would be S + B + T + N =0 +18 +0 +13=31.Check counts:Yellow: S(0) + N(13) + Y(2)=15. Correct.Round: S(0) + B(18) + T(0)=18. Correct.Edible: T(0) + N(13)=13. Correct.So this seems to work. So the maximum B is18.Wait, but the problem says &quot;he drew several things,&quot; which means at least one of each? Or can he draw zero of some items? The problem says &quot;among which there were exactly 15 yellow, 18 round, and 13 edible.&quot; It doesn&#39;t specify that he drew at least one of each item. So if T=0 is allowed, then this is acceptable.But let&#39;s check if all items are accounted for. So in this case, he drew 18 balls and 13 bananas. No suns or tomatoes. The bananas contribute to yellow and edible, the balls contribute to round. The yellow count comes from bananas (13) and yellow balls (2), totaling15. The round count is all from balls (18). Edible is all from bananas (13). That works.But wait, is there a constraint that balls must be yellow or non-yellow? The problem says &quot;balls can be of any color,&quot; so we can choose how many are yellow. So in this case, 2 balls are yellow and 16 are non-yellow.But is there any other constraint? For example, does the sun have to be drawn if we have yellow items? The problem doesn&#39;t say that. So if we can get away without drawing suns, that&#39;s fine.Therefore, according to this, the maximum number of balls is18.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s another scenario where we include suns. Maybe by having some suns, we can get a higher number of balls. Let&#39;s see.Suppose we don&#39;t set S=0. Let&#39;s assume S is positive.From S + B -N =5From S +N + Y=15We want to maximize B. Let&#39;s see if allowing S&gt;0 can give a higher B.Let’s suppose S is positive. Let&#39;s take N as low as possible to allow higher B. Wait, earlier when S=0, B=N +5. To get higher B, we need higher N, but when S increases, how does that affect B?Wait, let&#39;s solve for B.From S + B -N =5 =&gt; B=5 -S +NTo maximize B, since B=5 -S +N, we need to maximize (N -S). So if we can have N as large as possible and S as small as possible. The minimal S is0, which gives B=N +5, which is what we had before.If S&gt;0, then for the same N, B will be smaller by S. So to maximize B, S should be0. Therefore, the maximum B is achieved when S=0.Therefore, the previous solution is correct.But let&#39;s verify with another example. Let&#39;s take N=5 (minimum N=5). Then B=5 +5=10. Y=15 -5=10. So Y=10 yellow balls. Then T=13 -5=8 tomatoes. Check counts:Yellow: S(0) + N(5) + Y(10)=15. Correct.Round: S(0) + B(10) + T(8)=18. Correct.Edible: T(8) + N(5)=13. Correct.So this works. Here, we have 10 balls, 8 tomatoes, 5 bananas. But if we increase N, B increases as N +5.At N=10, B=15. Y=5. T=3.Check:Yellow:0 +10 +5=15Round:0 +15 +3=18Edible:3 +10=13Works.So as N increases, B increases. Therefore, maximum B when N=13, giving B=18.Therefore, the answer should be18.But wait, let&#39;s check if there&#39;s any constraint we missed. For example, the problem says &quot;Petya can draw only 4 things: the sun, a ball, a tomato, and a banana.&quot; But he drew several things. So he could have drawn any combination of these four. There&#39;s no restriction on the number of each, except the counts given (yellow, round, edible). So as long as the counts are satisfied, he can have any number of each item.Therefore, the maximum number of balls is18.But wait, let&#39;s check if in this case, all the balls except 2 are non-yellow. Is there any issue with that? The problem doesn&#39;t restrict the number of non-yellow balls, so it&#39;s acceptable.Alternatively, if we had some suns, would that allow more balls? Let&#39;s suppose we have S=1.Then from B=5 -1 +N=4 +N.To maximize B, set N as maximum. N=13 (since T=13 -N ≥0, N≤13). Then B=4 +13=17. Which is less than 18. So B decreases as S increases. Therefore, to maximize B, S must be0.Similarly, if we take S=2, then B=5 -2 +N=3 +N. For N=13, B=16, which is still less.Therefore, the maximum B occurs when S=0 and N=13, giving B=18.Thus, the answer is18.But let me just verify once more.Total items:18 balls (2 yellow, 16 non-yellow),13 bananas,0 suns,0 tomatoes.Yellow count:13 bananas (each yellow) +2 yellow balls=15. Correct.Round count:18 balls. Correct.Edible count:13 bananas. Correct.Yes, all constraints are satisfied. And this uses the maximum possible number of balls,18.Therefore, the answer is boxed{18}.&lt;/think&gt;To determine the maximum number of balls Petya could have drawn, we analyze the contributions of each item to the given counts (yellow, round, edible) and set up equations based on these contributions.Properties of each item:- Sun: Yellow, Round, Not Edible- Ball: Round, Color can be yellow or non-yellow, Not Edible- Tomato: Round, Edible- Banana: Yellow, Not Round, EdibleEquations:1. Yellow: ( S + N + Y = 15 )2. Round: ( S + B + T = 18 )3. Edible: ( T + N = 13 )Where:- ( S ) = number of suns- ( B ) = number of balls- ( T ) = number of tomatoes- ( N ) = number of bananas- ( Y ) = number of yellow ballsKey Steps:1. From the edible count, ( T = 13 - N ).2. Substitute ( T ) into the round count equation: ( S + B + (13 - N) = 18 ) ⟹ ( S + B - N = 5 ).3. Express ( S ) in terms of ( B ) and ( N ): ( S = 5 - B + N ).4. Substitute ( S ) into the yellow count equation: ( (5 - B + N) + N + Y = 15 ) ⟹ ( -B + 2N + Y = 10 ).5. To maximize ( B ), set ( S = 0 ) (since increasing ( S ) decreases ( B )): ( B = N + 5 ).6. Substitute ( B = N + 5 ) into the yellow count equation: ( Y = 15 - N ).7. Ensure ( Y leq B ): ( 15 - N leq N + 5 ) ⟹ ( 10 leq 2N ) ⟹ ( N geq 5 ).Maximizing ( B ):- The maximum ( N ) is 13 (since ( T = 13 - N geq 0 )).- Substitute ( N = 13 ): ( B = 13 + 5 = 18 ), ( Y = 15 - 13 = 2 ), ( T = 13 - 13 = 0 ), ( S = 0 ).Verification:- Yellow: ( 0 + 13 + 2 = 15 )- Round: ( 0 + 18 + 0 = 18 )- Edible: ( 0 + 13 = 13 )All constraints are satisfied with 18 balls, 13 bananas, 0 suns, and 0 tomatoes.Thus, the maximum number of balls Petya could have drawn is (boxed{18}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-276ea2c2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>🔑:</span>Answer: 18.Solution.

Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, maybe I can try expanding that expression. But (2 + √3)^4 seems a bit complicated. Wait, maybe there&#39;s a pattern or a recursive formula I can use here?I remember that expressions of the form (a + b)^n + (a - b)^n sometimes result in an integer if a and b are chosen such that the irrational parts cancel out. Let me check if that works here. Let&#39;s consider (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4. Since (2 - √3) is the conjugate of (2 + √3), maybe when I expand them, the terms with √3 will cancel out or add up nicely?Let me test that. Let&#39;s compute (2 + √3)^n + (2 - √3)^n for some small n first. Let&#39;s take n = 1: (2 + √3) + (2 - √3) = 4, which is an integer. For n = 2: (2 + √3)^2 + (2 - √3)^2. Let&#39;s compute (2 + √3)^2 first. (2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3. Similarly, (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3. Adding these together gives (7 + 4√3) + (7 - 4√3) = 14, another integer. Nice!So maybe this holds for higher powers. Let&#39;s check n = 3. Let&#39;s compute (2 + √3)^3. Using binomial expansion: 2^3 + 3*2^2*√3 + 3*2*(√3)^2 + (√3)^3. That would be 8 + 12√3 + 18 + 3√3. Wait, let me compute each term step by step. First term: 2^3 = 8. Second term: 3*(2)^2*(√3) = 3*4*√3 = 12√3. Third term: 3*(2)*(√3)^2 = 6*3 = 18. Fourth term: (√3)^3 = (√3)*(√3)^2 = √3*3 = 3√3. Adding all these terms: 8 + 12√3 + 18 + 3√3 = (8 + 18) + (12√3 + 3√3) = 26 + 15√3.Similarly, (2 - √3)^3 would be 8 - 12√3 + 18 - 3√3 = (8 + 18) + (-12√3 - 3√3) = 26 - 15√3. Adding these two gives (26 + 15√3) + (26 - 15√3) = 52, which is also an integer. So the pattern continues. So for n = 4, perhaps (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 is also an integer. Let&#39;s compute that.Alternatively, maybe there&#39;s a recursive relationship here. Let me denote S_n = (2 + √3)^n + (2 - √3)^n. Then maybe S_n follows a recurrence relation. Let&#39;s see S_1 = 4, S_2 = 14, S_3 = 52. Let&#39;s see if we can find a pattern here. 4, 14, 52. Let&#39;s check 14 = 4* something + something. 14 = 4* something + previous term? Not sure. Let&#39;s see 14 - 4 = 10, 52 - 14 = 38. Doesn&#39;t seem obvious. Maybe it&#39;s a linear recurrence. Let&#39;s suppose that S_n = a*S_{n-1} + b*S_{n-2}.Let&#39;s use S_1 = 4, S_2 = 14, S_3 = 52. So for n=3: 52 = a*14 + b*4. For n=2: 14 = a*4 + b*? Hmm, wait, maybe need another term. Wait, S_0 would be (2 + √3)^0 + (2 - √3)^0 = 1 + 1 = 2. So S_0 = 2. Then for n=1: 4 = a*2 + b*S_{-1}? Wait, perhaps n=2: 14 = a*4 + b*2. And n=3: 52 = a*14 + b*4. Let&#39;s set up the equations:For n=2: 14 = 4a + 2b  For n=3: 52 = 14a + 4bLet me solve these equations. From the first equation: 14 = 4a + 2b ⇒ 7 = 2a + b ⇒ b = 7 - 2a.  Substituting into the second equation: 52 = 14a + 4*(7 - 2a) ⇒ 52 = 14a + 28 - 8a ⇒ 52 = 6a + 28 ⇒ 6a = 24 ⇒ a = 4. Then b = 7 - 2*4 = 7 - 8 = -1. So the recurrence is S_n = 4*S_{n-1} - S_{n-2}.Let me verify that with S_3: 4*S_2 - S_1 = 4*14 - 4 = 56 - 4 = 52. Correct. Similarly, S_4 would be 4*S_3 - S_2 = 4*52 -14 = 208 -14 = 194. So S_4 = 194. Therefore, (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194.But the problem asks for the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4. Since (2 - √3) is a positive number less than 1 because √3 ≈ 1.732, so 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679. Therefore, (2 - √3)^4 ≈ (0.2679)^4 ≈ approximately 0.0052. So (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 194 - 0.0052 ≈ 193.9948. Therefore, the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4 is 193.But wait, let me confirm that (2 - √3)^4 is indeed positive and less than 1. Since 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679, raising it to the 4th power should make it even smaller. Let me compute (2 - √3)^4 step by step. First, compute (2 - √3)^2 = (4 - 4√3 + 3) = 7 - 4√3 ≈ 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072. Then, squaring that gives (7 - 4√3)^2. Let&#39;s compute that: 49 - 2*7*4√3 + (4√3)^2 = 49 - 56√3 + 16*3 = 49 - 56√3 + 48 = 97 - 56√3 ≈ 97 - 56*1.732 ≈ 97 - 97.0 (approximately) ≈ 0. So (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 97 - 56*1.732 ≈ 97 - 97.0 (approx) ≈ 0. So actually, maybe my initial approximation was wrong. Wait, 56*1.732: 50*1.732=86.6, 6*1.732=10.392, total 86.6+10.392=96.992. So 97 - 96.992 = 0.008. So (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 0.008. Therefore, (2 + √3)^4 ≈ 194 - 0.008 ≈ 193.992. Therefore, the greatest integer less than that is indeed 193.But let me verify this calculation again. Let&#39;s compute (2 - √3)^4 more accurately. First, 2 - √3 ≈ 2 - 1.73205 ≈ 0.26795. Then (0.26795)^2 ≈ 0.0718. Then (0.0718)^2 ≈ 0.00516. So (2 - √3)^4 ≈ 0.00516. Therefore, (2 + √3)^4 ≈ 194 - 0.00516 ≈ 193.99484. Therefore, the greatest integer less than this is 193. So the answer should be 193.But let me check with another approach. Maybe directly compute (2 + √3)^4. Let&#39;s try expanding it.First, (2 + √3)^4 can be written as [(2 + √3)^2]^2. We already computed (2 + √3)^2 = 7 + 4√3. Therefore, [(7 + 4√3)]^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*4√3 + (4√3)^2 = 49 + 56√3 + 16*3 = 49 + 56√3 + 48 = 97 + 56√3.So (2 + √3)^4 = 97 + 56√3. Now, 56√3 is approximately 56*1.73205 ≈ 56*1.73205. Let me compute that. 50*1.73205 = 86.6025, 6*1.73205 = 10.3923, total is 86.6025 + 10.3923 = 96.9948. Therefore, 97 + 96.9948 ≈ 193.9948. So the value of (2 + √3)^4 is approximately 193.9948, so the greatest integer less than that is 193. Therefore, the answer is 193.Alternatively, since (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194, and (2 - √3)^4 is positive but less than 1, then (2 + √3)^4 must be 194 minus something less than 1, so the integer part is 193. Therefore, the answer is 193.But just to make sure, maybe I can check with another method. Let me compute (2 + √3)^4 step by step.First, compute (2 + √3)^1 = 2 + √3 ≈ 3.732.(2 + √3)^2 = (2 + √3)*(2 + √3) = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3 ≈ 7 + 6.928 ≈ 13.928.(2 + √3)^3 = (2 + √3)*(7 + 4√3) = 2*7 + 2*4√3 + √3*7 + √3*4√3 = 14 + 8√3 + 7√3 + 4*3 = 14 + 15√3 + 12 = 26 + 15√3 ≈ 26 + 25.98 ≈ 51.98.(2 + √3)^4 = (2 + √3)*(26 + 15√3) = 2*26 + 2*15√3 + √3*26 + √3*15√3 = 52 + 30√3 + 26√3 + 15*3 = 52 + 56√3 + 45 = 97 + 56√3 ≈ 97 + 96.9948 ≈ 193.9948. Yes, same result. So the integer less than that is 193.Alternatively, if I use exact expressions, 56√3 is irrational, so 97 + 56√3 is irrational. Since (2 - √3)^4 is positive, then (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - (2 - √3)^4. Since (2 - √3)^4 is between 0 and 1, then (2 + √3)^4 is between 193 and 194. Therefore, the greatest integer less than it is 193.Therefore, the answer is boxed{193}.Final Answerboxed{193}&lt;/think&gt;To find the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4), we can use the conjugate pair ((2 + sqrt{3})) and ((2 - sqrt{3})). Let (S_n = (2 + sqrt{3})^n + (2 - sqrt{3})^n). We observe that (S_n) is an integer for all (n) because the irrational parts cancel out.We calculate the first few terms:- (S_1 = (2 + sqrt{3}) + (2 - sqrt{3}) = 4)- (S_2 = (2 + sqrt{3})^2 + (2 - sqrt{3})^2 = 14)- (S_3 = (2 + sqrt{3})^3 + (2 - sqrt{3})^3 = 52)We find a recurrence relation for (S_n):- (S_n = 4S_{n-1} - S_{n-2})Using this recurrence relation:- (S_4 = 4S_3 - S_2 = 4 times 52 - 14 = 208 - 14 = 194)Thus, ((2 + sqrt{3})^4 + (2 - sqrt{3})^4 = 194). Since (0 &lt; (2 - sqrt{3})^4 &lt; 1), we have:- ((2 + sqrt{3})^4 = 194 - (2 - sqrt{3})^4)Therefore, ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) is slightly less than 194, so the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) is (boxed{193}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to find the greatest integer less than (2 + √3)^4. Hmm, let&#39;s see. First, I remember that expressions with radicals like √3 can sometimes be tricky when raised to powers, especially if they are part of a binomial. Maybe there&#39;s a way to simplify this without expanding everything out directly. Let me think.Wait, I recall that (2 + √3) and (2 - √3) are conjugates. Their product is (2)^2 - (√3)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1. That&#39;s interesting because their product is 1. So maybe these two terms are reciprocals of each other? Let me check: (2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 1, so yes, (2 - √3) is the reciprocal of (2 + √3). That might come in handy.Also, I remember that when you have something like (a + b)^n + (a - b)^n, it often results in an integer because the irrational parts cancel out. Since (2 + √3) and (2 - √3) are conjugates, maybe raising them to a power and adding them together will give an integer. Let me try that.Let&#39;s denote x = 2 + √3 and y = 2 - √3. Then, we know that x * y = 1. Let&#39;s compute x^n + y^n for some n. For example, when n = 1: x + y = (2 + √3) + (2 - √3) = 4. That&#39;s an integer. For n = 2: x² + y². Let&#39;s compute x²: (2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3. Similarly, y² = (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3. So x² + y² = (7 + 4√3) + (7 - 4√3) = 14. Again, an integer.Similarly, for n = 3: x³ + y³. Let&#39;s compute x³: (2 + √3)^3. Let&#39;s expand this using binomial theorem. (a + b)^3 = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So here, a = 2, b = √3. Therefore, x³ = 8 + 3*(4)*√3 + 3*(2)*(3) + (√3)^3. Let&#39;s compute each term:First term: 8Second term: 3*(4)*√3 = 12√3Third term: 3*(2)*(3) = 18Fourth term: (√3)^3 = (√3)*(√3)^2 = √3*3 = 3√3So adding them up: 8 + 12√3 + 18 + 3√3 = (8 + 18) + (12√3 + 3√3) = 26 + 15√3.Similarly, y³ = (2 - √3)^3. Let&#39;s compute that similarly:First term: 8Second term: 3*(4)*(-√3) = -12√3Third term: 3*(2)*(3) = 18Fourth term: (-√3)^3 = - (√3)^3 = -3√3So adding them up: 8 - 12√3 + 18 - 3√3 = (8 + 18) + (-12√3 - 3√3) = 26 - 15√3.Therefore, x³ + y³ = (26 + 15√3) + (26 - 15√3) = 52. Another integer.Similarly, for n = 4, which is what we need, let&#39;s compute x⁴ + y⁴. Maybe we can find a recursive formula here. Since we have x and y such that x + y = 4 and xy = 1. There&#39;s a recursive relation for such sequences. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation.If we let S_n = x^n + y^n, then S_n satisfies the recurrence relation S_n = (x + y)*S_{n-1} - (xy)*S_{n-2}.Given that x + y = 4 and xy = 1, the recurrence is S_n = 4*S_{n-1} - 1*S_{n-2}.We already computed S_0: x^0 + y^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.S_1 = x + y = 4S_2 = 14S_3 = 52Then S_4 = 4*S_3 - S_2 = 4*52 - 14 = 208 - 14 = 194.So S_4 = 194. Which is x⁴ + y⁴ = 194.But we need x⁴. Since y = 2 - √3, and since √3 is approximately 1.732, 2 - √3 is approximately 0.2679, which is a positive number less than 1. Therefore, y⁴ will be a small positive number less than 1. Therefore, x⁴ = 194 - y⁴. Since y⁴ is less than 1, then x⁴ must be 194 - y⁴, which is just less than 194. Therefore, the greatest integer less than x⁴ is 193.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify that approach. So if x + y = 4 and xy = 1, then indeed, using the recurrence relation, S₄ = 194. Then since y = 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679, y⁴ ≈ (0.2679)^4. Let&#39;s compute that.First, 0.2679 squared is approximately 0.0718, then squared again is approximately 0.00516. So y⁴ ≈ 0.00516. Therefore, x⁴ = 194 - 0.00516 ≈ 193.9948. Therefore, the greatest integer less than x⁴ is 193. So the answer is 193.But let me confirm this by another method to make sure. Let&#39;s compute (2 + √3)^4 directly. Let&#39;s first compute (2 + √3)^2, then square the result.(2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3.Then, (7 + 4√3)^2. Let&#39;s compute that:7^2 = 492*7*4√3 = 56√3(4√3)^2 = 16*3 = 48So adding them up: 49 + 56√3 + 48 = 97 + 56√3.So (2 + √3)^4 = 97 + 56√3.Now, compute 56√3. √3 ≈ 1.732. So 56*1.732 ≈ 56*1.732.Let&#39;s compute 56*1.732:First, 50*1.732 = 86.66*1.732 = 10.392Adding them: 86.6 + 10.392 = 96.992Therefore, 56√3 ≈ 96.992.Therefore, 97 + 96.992 ≈ 193.992.So (2 + √3)^4 ≈ 193.992. Therefore, the greatest integer less than that is 193. So that confirms the answer is 193.Alternatively, since we have (2 + √3)^4 + (2 - √3)^4 = 194, and (2 - √3)^4 is a small positive number, then (2 + √3)^4 = 194 - (2 - √3)^4. Since (2 - √3)^4 is positive, 194 - something positive less than 1 (as we saw ≈ 0.005), so (2 + √3)^4 is less than 194, so the integer part is 193.Therefore, the answer is 193.Final Answerboxed{193}&lt;/think&gt;To find the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4), we can use the properties of conjugate pairs. Let (x = 2 + sqrt{3}) and (y = 2 - sqrt{3}). These conjugates satisfy (x cdot y = 1) and (x + y = 4).We need to compute (x^4 + y^4). Using the recurrence relation for sequences defined by (S_n = (x + y)S_{n-1} - (xy)S_{n-2}) with (S_0 = 2) and (S_1 = 4):- (S_2 = 4 cdot 4 - 1 cdot 2 = 16 - 2 = 14)- (S_3 = 4 cdot 14 - 1 cdot 4 = 56 - 4 = 52)- (S_4 = 4 cdot 52 - 1 cdot 14 = 208 - 14 = 194)Thus, (x^4 + y^4 = 194). Since (y = 2 - sqrt{3}) is a positive number less than 1, (y^4) is a very small positive number (approximately (0.005)). Therefore, (x^4 = 194 - y^4) is just less than 194. The greatest integer less than (x^4) is 193.To verify, we compute ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) directly:- ((2 + sqrt{3})^2 = 7 + 4sqrt{3})- ((7 + 4sqrt{3})^2 = 97 + 56sqrt{3})Approximating (56sqrt{3} approx 96.992), we get (97 + 96.992 approx 193.992), confirming the result.Thus, the greatest integer less than ((2 + sqrt{3})^4) is (boxed{193}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-276ea2c2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>🔑:</span>11.

So, we have a square sheet that&#39;s folded twice along its diagonals, resulting in a triangle. Then, a straight cut is made parallel to the larger side of this triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. When unfolded, there&#39;s a square hole in the middle. We need to find what fraction of the original square&#39;s area this hole is. The options are from 1/2 to 1/4, so probably something like 1/4 or 1/6 or 3/8... Hmm.First, let me visualize the folding. If we start with a square and fold it along one diagonal, we get a triangle. Then folding it again along the other diagonal would result in a smaller triangle, right? Wait, no. If you fold a square along both diagonals, each fold is along a different diagonal. But folding twice along diagonals... Maybe after the first fold along one diagonal, folding again along the other diagonal would result in a triangle with a right angle? Wait, the original square has two diagonals. Folding along one diagonal gives a triangle, then folding along the other diagonal would bring two corners together. Let me try to imagine.Alternatively, perhaps after folding along both diagonals, the square is folded into a quarter of its original size? Each diagonal fold halves the area. So folding twice would make it 1/4? But the problem says after folding twice along its diagonals, resulting in a triangle. Wait, each diagonal fold of a square gives a triangle. If you fold it once, you have a triangle. Then folding again along the other diagonal, which is now the hypotenuse of the triangle. Wait, if you have a right-angled triangle (from folding a square along the diagonal), then folding along the hypotenuse&#39;s midpoint... Hmm, maybe the resulting shape is still a triangle but with different dimensions?Wait, perhaps the first fold along one diagonal creates an isosceles right triangle. Then folding again along the other diagonal, which is now the altitude of the triangle? Wait, maybe not. Let&#39;s take it step by step.Original square: let&#39;s assume the square has side length 2 units for simplicity, so area 4. Then, folding along one diagonal (say, from top-left to bottom-right) gives a triangle with legs of length 2, and hypotenuse 2√2. Then, folding along the other diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) would bring the two corners together. Wait, but if you fold along the other diagonal of the original square, which is now part of the folded triangle. Maybe the second fold is along the other diagonal of the original square, but after the first fold, that diagonal is now an edge? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should draw a diagram mentally.Alternatively, perhaps folding along both diagonals in sequence reduces the square to a triangle that&#39;s 1/4 the area. But if each fold halves the area, then two folds would make it 1/4. So starting with area 4, after first fold: 2, then after second fold: 1. But the problem says the result is a triangle. So maybe the second fold is along the diagonal of the triangle. The first fold gives a triangle with area half. Then folding that triangle along its own diagonal? Wait, the triangle is right-angled, so its own diagonal would be the altitude? Hmm.Wait, maybe another approach. Let&#39;s think of the square as a piece of paper. Fold along one diagonal: now it&#39;s a triangle. Then fold along the other diagonal of the original square. Wait, when folded along the first diagonal, the other diagonal is now a line from the right angle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. If you fold along that, you would be folding the triangle in half again. So the resulting figure after two folds is a smaller triangle, with 1/4 the area of the original square. So the folded triangle has area 1 if the original was 4.But the problem says after folding twice along its diagonals, resulting in a triangle. So the resulting triangle is 1/4 of the original square. Then, they make a straight cut parallel to the larger side of this triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. Wait, the larger side of the triangle. Since it&#39;s a right-angled triangle, the larger side is the hypotenuse. So the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse, passing through the midpoints of the other two sides (the legs). Let me visualize that.If the triangle after folding is a right-angled triangle, with legs of length 1 (since original square was 2x2, folded twice, each fold halving the length?), but maybe not. Wait, maybe I need to assign coordinates to make this precise.Let me set up a coordinate system. Let the original square have vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). First fold along the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2). Then, the square is folded into a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, actually folding along the diagonal would result in the triangle covering the lower-left half. Wait, maybe (0,0), (2,0), (0,2)? No, the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2) divides the square into two triangles. So folding along that diagonal would result in overlapping the two triangles, so the visible triangle is from (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,2). Hmm.Wait, actually, when you fold a square along the diagonal, the resulting shape is a triangle with vertices at three corners of the original square. Let&#39;s say we fold along the main diagonal (from bottom-left to top-right), so the resulting triangle has vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Then, folding again along the other diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right). But after the first fold, the square is now a triangle. The other diagonal of the original square would correspond to a line from (0,2) to (2,0), but in the folded triangle, this line is now a crease. So folding along that crease would bring the point (0,2) down to meet (2,0)? Wait, maybe.Alternatively, perhaps after the first fold, the square is a triangle, and folding along the other diagonal of the original square would actually be folding along a median or an altitude of the triangle. Let me think. The original square&#39;s diagonals intersect at the center. When folded along one diagonal, the other diagonal becomes a line from the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse.So, after first fold: triangle with legs of 2 units each (assuming original square side 2). The hypotenuse is 2√2. The midpoint of the hypotenuse is at (1,1) in the original square, but after folding, coordinates might be different. Wait, maybe coordinates are getting confusing here.Alternatively, think of the folded triangle. The first fold along the diagonal gives a triangle with legs equal to the side of the square. Let&#39;s say the square has side length 2. So legs are 2 each. The second fold is along the other diagonal. But in the folded triangle, where is this other diagonal? In the original square, the two diagonals intersect at the center. After folding along one diagonal, the other diagonal is now a line from the right angle vertex (say, at (0,0)) to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. So in the triangle, folding along that line would divide the triangle into two smaller triangles. Each of those would have area 1/4 of the original square.So after two folds, the resulting shape is a triangle with area 1 (if original area is 4). Then, they make a straight cut parallel to the larger side (the hypotenuse) of this triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. So in this small triangle, the sides are the two legs (which were halves of the original square&#39;s sides?) and the hypotenuse.Wait, perhaps we need to get clearer on the dimensions after each fold.Let me take the original square of side length 2, area 4.First fold: along the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2). The resulting triangle has vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). The sides are of length 2, 2, and 2√2. The midpoint of the hypotenuse (from (2,0) to (2,2)) is at (2,1). But in the folded triangle, the hypotenuse is the original diagonal. Wait, maybe coordinates are complicating things.Alternatively, think of the triangle after the first fold as a right-angled triangle with legs of length 2. Then, folding along the other diagonal of the original square would correspond to folding along the median to the hypotenuse. So, the second fold would take the triangle and fold it such that the right-angle vertex meets the midpoint of the hypotenuse. This would create a smaller triangle with base along the hypotenuse.Wait, perhaps after the second fold, the triangle is folded along its median, resulting in a smaller triangle with base half the hypotenuse. So the area would be 1/4 of the original square. Then, making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side) through the midpoints of the other sides. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe after two folds, the shape is a triangle where each fold has halved the area. So original area 4, first fold to 2, second fold to 1. Then, the triangle has area 1. Then, when you make a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the largest side) through the midpoints of the other sides, you are effectively removing a smaller triangle from the folded one.Wait, but when you make a straight cut parallel to the hypotenuse, passing through the midpoints of the legs. So, in the folded triangle (which is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1, since area 1, assuming the original square was 4). The legs would be of length sqrt(2), maybe? Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe assigning coordinates would help.Let&#39;s try again with coordinates. Let the original square have vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). Fold along the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2). After folding, the square becomes a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Now, fold along the other diagonal of the original square, which is from (0,2) to (2,0). But in the folded triangle, this diagonal is now a line from (0,2) to (2,0). However, after the first fold, the point (0,2) is now folded over to (2,0). So folding along this line would essentially crease the triangle along the line from (1,1) to (2,0)? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the second fold is along the crease that was the original diagonal from (0,2) to (2,0), but in the folded triangle, this line is a crease from (2,0) to (1,1), since (0,2) coincides with (2,0) after the first fold? Hmm, this is getting too confusing.Maybe a different approach. When you fold a square along its two diagonals, the center of the square is where the diagonals intersect. Each fold brings opposite corners together. So folding twice would result in a shape that&#39;s a quarter of the original square, but the exact shape is a triangle. Then, making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the longest side) of this triangle, through the midpoints of the other sides. So when you unfold, the cuts will be replicated in each quadrant, creating a hole in the center.Wait, if each fold is along the diagonal, then the final shape is a triangle with 1/4 the area. Then, when you make a cut in that triangle, upon unfolding, the cut is mirrored in each of the four folded sections. So the hole created is where all the cuts overlap.Alternatively, think of it as making a single cut in the folded paper, which translates to multiple cuts when unfolded. Since the paper is folded twice, each cut is replicated four times. But the hole is in the center, so maybe the cuts from each fold intersect there.Wait, but the problem says when you unfold, there&#39;s a square hole in the middle. So the cuts must form a square when unfolded. If the original cuts were made in such a way that they intersect at the center when folded.Alternatively, when the paper is folded twice along the diagonals, the center of the square is at the intersection point of the folds. Making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side of the triangle) through the midpoints of the other sides. So, in the folded triangle, the larger side is the hypotenuse. A line parallel to this hypotenuse, passing through the midpoints of the other two sides. So that line would be a midline of the triangle, creating a smaller similar triangle on top and a trapezoid below.Since the midline is parallel to the hypotenuse and half its length, the smaller triangle would have 1/4 the area of the original triangle. But since the original triangle was 1/4 of the square, the hole would be 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 of the original square? But that&#39;s not one of the options. Hmm. Maybe not.Wait, the hole is not the area of the cut-out piece, but the area of the hole. Wait, when you make a cut in the folded paper, you remove a piece, which becomes a hole when unfolded. So the area of the hole is equal to the area of the piece removed multiplied by the number of layers. Since the paper is folded twice, each layer is 1/4 of the original. Wait, no. When folded twice, each cut goes through four layers? Wait, let me think.Folding a square once along a diagonal halves the area and creates two layers. Folding again along the other diagonal halves it again, resulting in four layers. So when you make a cut through the four-layered folded paper, the hole will be replicated four times when unfolded. But if the cut is made such that it&#39;s through all layers, then the area of the hole would be the area of the cut multiplied by the number of layers. Wait, but actually, when you cut through multiple layers, each layer gets a hole. So the total area of the hole would be the area of the cut multiplied by the number of layers. But if the hole is in the middle, overlapping, maybe it&#39;s not multiplied but combined.Wait, perhaps the hole is only cut once, but because of the folding, when you unfold, the hole is replicated in each folded section. However, since it&#39;s folded along both diagonals, the hole would appear in all four quadrants. But the problem says &quot;a square hole was obtained in the middle of the sheet.&quot; So the holes from each quadrant combine to form a single square in the center. Therefore, the total area of the hole is the sum of the areas from each cut, but since they overlap in the center, it&#39;s actually just one square. Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.Suppose the original square is folded twice, resulting in four layers (each fold doubles the layers). Then, cutting through all four layers at once would result in four holes when unfolded, but if the cut is positioned such that it&#39;s symmetric, those four holes might overlap partially. However, the problem states that there&#39;s a single square hole in the middle. So perhaps the cuts from each layer align to form a square in the center. Therefore, the area of the hole is equal to the area cut from one layer multiplied by the number of layers, but since they overlap, it&#39;s actually a single square. Wait, that might not be correct.Alternatively, when you fold the square twice, you have four layers. If you make a single cut through all four layers, the resulting hole when unfolded is four times the size of the cut. But if the cut is in the center, it might result in a single hole whose area is four times the area of the cut. Wait, but the answer is a fraction of the original square. So if the cut is, say, a small square in the folded paper, when unfolded, it becomes four such squares. But if the four small squares combine to form a larger square in the center, maybe their total area is equivalent to a single square of double the size? Hmm, this is tricky.Wait, maybe a concrete example. Let&#39;s assume the original square has side length 2. After folding twice, the folded triangle has side lengths of sqrt(2), but perhaps not. Let me consider the triangle after two folds. Wait, first fold: square becomes triangle with legs 2, area 2. Second fold: triangle is folded again, resulting in a smaller triangle with legs 1, area 1. So each fold halves the area. Then, the final folded triangle has area 1. Then, making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the longer side) through the midpoints of the other sides. So in this triangle with legs 1, the hypotenuse is sqrt(2). The midpoints of the legs are at 0.5 units from the right angle. A line parallel to the hypotenuse, passing through these midpoints. That line would form a smaller similar triangle on top, with legs 0.5, hypotenuse 0.5*sqrt(2). The area of this smaller triangle is (0.5*0.5)/2 = 0.125. Since the folded triangle had area 1 (which is 1/4 of the original square), cutting out this small triangle would remove 0.125 from the folded area. But since the paper was folded four times (each fold doubling the layers), wait, no. Wait, first fold: 2 layers. Second fold: 4 layers. So cutting through 4 layers. Therefore, the hole area would be 0.125 * 4 = 0.5, which is 1/2 of the original square. But 1/2 is option (a), but the answer is supposed to be a square hole. Wait, but 0.5 of the original area would be too big. The options include 1/4, 1/6, 3/8, etc. Hmm, maybe my calculations are off.Alternatively, perhaps the cut is not removing a triangle but a rectangle or a square. Wait, but the problem says when you unfold, you get a square hole. So the cut in the folded triangle must correspond to a square when unfolded. So how does a straight cut in the folded triangle result in a square hole?Let me think. If the original square is folded along both diagonals, the center of the square is at the intersection of the diagonals. Making a straight cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the longer side) of the folded triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. So in the folded triangle, the &quot;other sides&quot; would be the two legs. Their midpoints are halfway along each leg. So a line parallel to the hypotenuse, passing through these midpoints. In a right-angled triangle, a line parallel to the hypotenuse and passing through the midpoints of the legs is the midline of the triangle, which is half the length of the hypotenuse and divides the triangle into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid. The length of this midline is half the hypotenuse, so if the hypotenuse was, say, length L, the midline is L/2.When you cut along this midline in the folded triangle, then upon unfolding, how does this translate? Since the paper was folded twice, the cut is replicated four times, each at 90-degree rotations? Or symmetrically across the diagonals. So this midline cut would create four such cuts in the original square, forming a square hole where they intersect.Wait, let&#39;s try to imagine. If the original square is folded along both diagonals, the resulting triangle has the center of the square at the intersection point. Making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the longest side) through the midpoints of the legs. When you unfold once, you have a cut in each of the two triangles from the first fold. Then unfolding again, each of those cuts is mirrored in the other two triangles. So in total, there are four cuts forming a square in the center. Each cut is a straight line parallel to the original hypotenuse, passing through midpoints. So these lines would form a square in the center where all the cuts overlap.To calculate the area, let&#39;s assume the original square has side length 2. The center is at (1,1). The midpoints of the sides of the original square are at (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). If the cuts are made from these midpoints towards the center, but parallel to the diagonals. Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, after folding twice, the triangle is such that the cut is a line segment parallel to the hypotenuse (which was the original diagonal) and passing through the midpoints of the legs. In the folded triangle, the legs are half the length of the original square&#39;s sides. So if the original square had side length 2, the folded triangle after two folds would have legs of length 1. The midline cut would be a line parallel to the hypotenuse, halfway up the legs. This line would be at a distance of 0.5 from the right angle. The length of this midline is half the hypotenuse, so if the hypotenuse was sqrt(2), the midline is sqrt(2)/2. The area of the trapezoid removed is the area of the original triangle minus the area of the smaller triangle. The original triangle area is (1*1)/2 = 0.5. The smaller triangle has legs of 0.5, so area (0.5*0.5)/2 = 0.125. So the area removed is 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375. But this is in the folded triangle, which is 1/4 of the original square. Wait, no. Wait, if the original square has area 4, the first fold makes area 2, the second fold makes area 1. So the folded triangle has area 1. Then the area removed is 0.375 of this folded triangle, which is 0.375 * 1 = 0.375. But since the folded triangle is 1/4 of the original square, then the hole area would be 0.375 * 4 = 1.5. But that&#39;s impossible because the original area is 4, and the hole can&#39;t be 1.5. So this approach is wrong.Wait, maybe the area of the hole is the area removed multiplied by the number of layers. Since folding twice gives four layers, cutting through all four layers at once. So if the cut removes a shape of area A in the folded paper, the actual hole area is 4A. So if in the folded triangle, the cut removes a trapezoid of area 0.375, then the hole is 4 * 0.375 = 1.5, which is 3/8 of the original square (since 1.5 / 4 = 3/8). Option (c). Hmm, but 3/8 is one of the options. Let me verify.Wait, in the folded triangle (area 1, which is 1/4 of the original square). The cut removes a trapezoid with area 0.375. Then, since each layer is 1/4 of the original, the hole would be 0.375 * 4 = 1.5, which is 3/8 of 4. So yes, 1.5 / 4 = 3/8. So the answer is (c). But I need to confirm this.Alternatively, maybe the area removed is a rectangle. If the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse and passes through the midpoints of the legs, then in the folded triangle, which is a right-angled triangle, this cut would form a smaller similar triangle at the top and a trapezoid at the bottom. The area of the trapezoid is the area of the original folded triangle minus the area of the smaller triangle. If the legs are length 1, then the smaller triangle has legs 0.5, so area (0.5 * 0.5)/2 = 0.125. Original triangle area is (1 * 1)/2 = 0.5. So the trapezoid area is 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375. Then, since the paper was folded into four layers, the total hole area is 4 * 0.375 = 1.5. Original square area is 4, so the fraction is 1.5/4 = 3/8. So the answer should be (c).Alternatively, maybe the hole is a square whose sides are half the length of the original square. If the original square is 2x2, the hole is 1x1, area 1, which is 1/4. But 1/4 is option (e). But according to the previous calculation, it&#39;s 3/8. Hmm.Wait, but when you make the cut parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints, the shape removed is a trapezoid, but when unfolded, how does it look? Maybe it&#39;s a diamond shape or a square. Let me think.If you fold the square along both diagonals, the center is the intersection point. Then, cutting parallel to the hypotenuse (which is the original diagonal) through the midpoints, which are at the center of the sides of the original square. When you unfold, the cut would be along lines that are parallel to the diagonals, passing through midpoints of the sides. These lines would form a square in the center where they intersect.Each cut is a line from the midpoint of one side to the midpoint of the adjacent side, but parallel to the diagonal. Wait, no. If you cut parallel to the diagonal (hypotenuse) through the midpoints, then unfolding would create four such cuts, each in a different quadrant, forming a square. The distance between the cut and the diagonal would determine the size of the hole.Assuming the original square has side length 2, midpoints at (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). If the cuts are lines parallel to the diagonals, passing through these midpoints, then the square hole is formed by the intersection of these cuts. The distance from the diagonal to the cut is half the distance from the diagonal to the midpoint. Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry.Let’s model the original square with coordinates (0,0) to (2,2). The diagonals are y = x and y = -x + 2. The midpoints of the sides are (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), and (0,1). A cut parallel to the diagonal y = x would be a line with slope 1 passing through (1,0). The equation is y - 0 = 1*(x -1), so y = x -1. Similarly, another cut parallel to y = x passing through (0,1): y -1 = 1*(x -0), so y = x +1. Similarly, cuts parallel to the other diagonal y = -x +2: passing through (2,1) would be y -1 = -1*(x -2), so y = -x +3. And passing through (1,2): y -2 = -1*(x -1), so y = -x +3. Wait, but these lines form a square where they intersect.Solving the intersections:1. y = x -1 and y = -x +3: x -1 = -x +3 → 2x =4 → x=2, y=1. But (2,1) is a midpoint.2. y = x +1 and y = -x +3: x +1 = -x +3 → 2x=2 →x=1, y=2.3. y = x +1 and y = -x +3: same as above.Wait, perhaps the four lines form a square with vertices at (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). Wait, those are the midpoints. But connecting them would form a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with side length sqrt(2). The area of this square would be (distance between (1,0) and (2,1))². Wait, the distance between (1,0) and (2,1) is sqrt((1)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the side length is sqrt(2), area is 2. Original square area is 4, so the hole is 2/4 = 1/2. But 1/2 is option (a). But this contradicts previous calculations.Wait, but if the hole is the diamond connecting the midpoints, that&#39;s actually a square with diagonals equal to 2 (distance from (1,0) to (1,2)) and 2 (distance from (0,1) to (2,1)). The area of a rhombus is (d1*d2)/2 = (2*2)/2=2. So area 2, which is 1/2 of the original square. But the answer isn&#39;t 1/2. The problem says &quot;a square hole was obtained in the middle&quot;. The diamond shape is a square, area 2. But option (a) is 1/2. However, the answer might not be this because when you fold the paper and make a single cut, the hole isn&#39;t connecting all midpoints, but only a portion.Wait, perhaps my coordinate approach is not considering the folding properly. Let&#39;s think again.After folding the square twice along its diagonals, we have a triangle. The cut is made parallel to the larger side (hypotenuse) passing through midpoints of the other sides. In the folded triangle, the other sides are the legs. Their midpoints are at half the length. So the cut is a line parallel to the hypotenuse, halfway up the legs. This line is the midline of the triangle, which is half the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hole created by this cut, when unfolded, would be a square whose side is half the length of the original square&#39;s side.If the original square has side length 2, the hole has side length 1, area 1. So 1/4 of the original area, which is option (e). But earlier calculations suggested 3/8. Which is correct?Wait, perhaps when you make the cut in the folded triangle, which is 1/4 of the original square, the area removed is 1/8 of the original square. Then, since the cut is made through four layers, the total area removed is 4*(1/8) = 1/2. But this is conflicting.Alternatively, in the folded triangle (1/4 of the original area), the cut removes a portion. If the cut is a line parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints, the area removed is a trapezoid. The area of the trapezoid is 3/8 of the original square. Wait, no.Let me approach it with coordinates again, carefully.Original square: vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2).First fold along the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2). The folded triangle has vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Second fold along the other diagonal from (0,2) to (2,0). After folding, the shape is a smaller triangle with vertices at (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, maybe not. Folding along (0,2) to (2,0) in the already folded triangle.Alternatively, after the first fold, the square is a triangle. The second fold is along the line from (0,2) to (2,0), which in the folded triangle corresponds to folding the point (0,2) onto (2,0). The intersection of the two diagonals is at (1,1). So folding along the second diagonal would create a crease from (1,1) to (2,0) and (2,2). Wait, I&#39;m getting confused.Alternatively, after two folds, the paper is folded into a triangle with vertices at (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). The larger side is from (2,0) to (2,2), which is vertical. Wait, but the problem states that the cut is parallel to the larger side, which is the hypotenuse. Wait, if after two folds, the larger side is vertical, then the cut is parallel to that, passing through midpoints of the other sides. The other sides are from (1,1) to (2,0) and (1,1) to (2,2). Their midpoints would be at (1.5, 0.5) and (1.5, 1.5). A vertical line through these midpoints would be x = 1.5. Cutting along x=1.5 in the folded triangle. When unfolded, this would create a vertical cut at x=1.5 and mirrored on the other side, forming a rectangle. But the problem states it&#39;s a square hole. Hmm, this isn&#39;t matching.Alternatively, perhaps the larger side is the hypotenuse of the folded triangle. Let&#39;s say after two folds, the triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1, hypotenuse sqrt(2). Then, a cut parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints of the legs. The midline in a right-angled triangle parallel to the hypotenuse is at half the height, forming a smaller similar triangle with half the legs. So the legs of the smaller triangle are 0.5 each, area 0.125. The original folded triangle area was 0.5 (if original square is 2x2). Wait, if original square is 2x2, area 4. First fold: triangle area 2. Second fold: triangle area 1. The midline cut removes a trapezoid of area 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Wait, no. Wait, original triangle area after two folds is 1. The cut removes a trapezoid whose area is original area minus the smaller triangle. The smaller triangle has legs half as long, so area (0.5 * 0.5)/2 = 0.125. So trapezoid area is 1 - 0.125 = 0.875. Then, since the paper is folded into four layers, the total hole area is 0.875 * 4 = 3.5, which is more than the original square. That can&#39;t be.I must be making a mistake here. Let&#39;s try a different method. When you fold a square along its two diagonals, the resulting figure is a right-angled triangle with legs equal to half the original square&#39;s side. Wait, no. If the original square is of side length 2, folding along one diagonal gives a triangle of legs 2 each. Folding along the other diagonal brings the two corners together, resulting in a triangle with legs of length sqrt(2). Wait, maybe not. This is getting too unclear without a diagram.Alternatively, think of the hole. The problem states that when you unfold, there&#39;s a square hole in the middle. So the hole must be a square whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original square. The area of this hole is a certain fraction of the original square.Given that the cut is made parallel to the larger side of the triangle (the hypotenuse) and passes through the midpoints of the other sides, which are the legs. When you make this cut, you&#39;re effectively creating a smaller similar triangle at the end of the folded paper. When you unfold it, this cut would create a square hole where the paper was removed from all four quadrants.The key is that the cut is made through four layers (since folded twice), so the area of the hole is four times the area of the cut in one layer. If the cut in the folded triangle is a line segment of length L, then the hole would be a square with side L/√2 (since the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse, which is at 45 degrees). But I&#39;m not sure.Wait, when you make a cut parallel to the hypotenuse of the folded triangle, which is a right-angled triangle, the cut is a line segment parallel to the hypotenuse, at a distance halfway up the legs. This line segment is equal in length to half the hypotenuse. Since the hypotenuse of the folded triangle is sqrt(2) (if original square has side 2), the cut is length sqrt(2)/2. When you unfold, this cut becomes four such segments arranged in a square, each of length sqrt(2)/2, forming a square with side length sqrt(2)/2 / √2 = 1/2. Wait, the diagonal of the square hole is sqrt(2)/2, so the side length is (sqrt(2)/2)/√2 = 1/2. Therefore, area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. But 1/4 is option (e). However, the problem says the hole is square and in the middle, which would make sense if each side is 1/2 of the original square&#39;s side. But the original square&#39;s side is 2, so the hole would be 1x1, area 1, which is 1/4 of 4. So 1/4, option (e).But wait, this contradicts the previous calculation where the hole was formed by four cuts. If each cut is length sqrt(2)/2, and they form a square, the perimeter of the hole would be four times sqrt(2)/2, but that&#39;s not directly helpful. Alternatively, if the hole is a square rotated 45 degrees, with its vertices at the midpoints of the original square&#39;s sides. That square would have side length sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2) = 1. Wait, no.Alternatively, the four cuts form the sides of the square hole. Each cut is a line from the midpoint of a side to the midpoint of the adjacent side, forming a smaller square inside. The distance from the center to each side is 1 (since original square is 2x2). The hole is a square whose sides are equidistant from the center. If the cuts are made through the midpoints, then the hole is a square connecting the midpoints, which is a square of side length sqrt(2), area 2, which is 1/2 of the original. But that contradicts.I think I need to recall that when you fold a square paper twice along the diagonals, then cut a hole, the area of the hole depends on the number of layers cut through. Each fold doubles the layers. So two folds mean 4 layers. If the cut is through all layers, the hole&#39;s area is the size of the cut multiplied by 4. But if the cut in the folded paper is a small triangle, then the total hole is four times that.In the problem, the cut is parallel to the larger side (hypotenuse) of the folded triangle and passes through the midpoints of the other two sides. In the folded triangle, this cut is a midline, removing a small triangle. The area of this small triangle is 1/4 of the folded triangle&#39;s area. Since the folded triangle is 1/4 of the original square, the small triangle is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. But multiplied by 4 layers, it&#39;s 1/4. So the hole is 1/4. But wait, no. Wait, if the folded triangle has area 1/4 of the original square, and the cut removes 1/4 of that (the small triangle), then the area removed is 1/16. But since it&#39;s cut through four layers, the total area is 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. So 1/4, option (e). But earlier coordinate approach suggested the hole area is 1, which is 1/4 of 4. So this matches. So the answer is (e) 1/4.But I need to confirm. Let me assume the original square is 4 area. Folded twice, area 1. Cut removes 1/4 of that area (0.25). Multiply by 4 layers: total hole area 1, which is 1/4 of 4. So yes, 1/4. Therefore, the answer is (e) 1/4.But wait, when you make a midline cut in the folded triangle, you remove a trapezoid, not a triangle. Wait, no. If the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse and passes through the midpoints of the legs, then in a right-angled triangle, this line is the midline, which creates a smaller similar triangle on top (with 1/4 the area of the folded triangle) and a trapezoid. So the area removed is the trapezoid, which is 3/4 of the folded triangle. So folded triangle area is 1 (original square 4), trapezoid area is 3/4, times 4 layers: 3/4 *4= 3. So 3/4 of the original square. But that&#39;s option (d), which is not correct.Wait, this is the confusion. If the folded triangle has area 1 (original square 4), and the cut removes the trapezoid (area 3/4), then the hole is 3/4 *4= 3, which is impossible. So this must be wrong.Alternatively, when you make the cut, you are removing the part below the midline. So in the folded triangle, area 1, the trapezoid is the area below the midline, which is 3/4 of the folded triangle. So 3/4 of 1 is 3/4. But since the paper is folded into four layers, the total area removed is 3/4 *4= 3. Which is 3/4 of the original square. But that can&#39;t be, since the hole can&#39;t be larger than the square.Clearly, my approach is flawed. Let me find another way.Perhaps considering symmetry. The hole is a square in the center. Let its side be &#39;s&#39;. The original square has side &#39;a&#39;, area a². The hole has area s². We need to find s²/a².When folding the square along both diagonals, the center remains the same. The cut is made parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side) of the folded triangle, passing through midpoints of the other sides. These midpoints, when unfolded, correspond to midpoints of the original square&#39;s sides.Thus, the cut in the folded paper corresponds to four cuts in the original square, each from the midpoint of a side towards the center, parallel to the diagonals. These four cuts form a square hole in the center. The distance from the center to each cut is half the distance from the center to the midpoint.Wait, the midpoints of the original square&#39;s sides are at (a/2, 0), (a, a/2), (a/2, a), (0, a/2). A cut parallel to the diagonal, passing through these midpoints. For example, a line parallel to the diagonal from (0,0) to (a,a), passing through (a/2, 0). The equation of this line is y = x - a/2. Similarly, a line parallel to the other diagonal, passing through (a, a/2): y = -x + 3a/2. These two lines intersect at (a/2, a/2). Similarly, the other two lines form the other sides of the square hole.The intersection points of these lines form a square. For example, solving y = x - a/2 and y = -x + 3a/2:x - a/2 = -x + 3a/22x = 2ax = a, y = a/2. But that&#39;s the midpoint. Wait, maybe not. Let me use a =2 for simplicity.Equations:1. y = x -1 (passing through (1,0))2. y = -x +3 (passing through (2,1))3. y = x +1 (passing through (0,1))4. y = -x -1 + something? Wait, no.Wait, for the original square with side 2, the four cuts would be:1. From (1,0) parallel to the diagonal y = x: line y = x -1.2. From (2,1) parallel to the diagonal y = -x +2: line y = -x +3.3. From (1,2) parallel to the diagonal y = x: line y = x +1.4. From (0,1) parallel to the diagonal y = -x +2: line y = -x +1.These four lines form a square. Solving intersections:1. y = x -1 and y = -x +3: x -1 = -x +3 → 2x =4 → x=2, y=1. That&#39;s point (2,1).2. y = -x +3 and y = x +1: -x +3 = x +1 → -2x =-2 →x=1, y=2. Point (1,2).3. y = x +1 and y = -x +1: x +1 = -x +1 → 2x =0 →x=0, y=1. Point (0,1).4. y = -x +1 and y = x -1: -x +1 =x -1 → -2x =-2 →x=1, y=0. Point (1,0).Wait, these intersection points are the midpoints themselves. So the four lines pass through the midpoints and are parallel to the diagonals, forming a square hole. However, the square hole is actually the diamond formed by connecting these midpoints. The vertices of the hole are at the midpoints of the original square&#39;s sides. This diamond is a square rotated 45 degrees, with diagonals equal to the side length of the original square. The area of this square is (side²)/2. If the original square has side length 2, the diagonals of the hole are 2 each, so area (2*2)/2=2. Original square area is 4, so the hole is 2/4=1/2. But this contradicts the previous thought that it&#39;s 1/4.But the answer options include 1/2 as option (a). However, the problem states that the hole is in the middle of the sheet, which this diamond is, but according to this calculation, the area is 1/2. However, the answer given in the options isn&#39;t clear. Wait, but when you fold the square twice and make a single cut, the hole should be created by the overlapping of the cuts in each fold. If the cut is through all layers, the hole&#39;s area would be the sum of the areas cut from each layer. But this might not be simply additive.Wait, if you fold the square twice, creating four layers, and make a single cut through all four layers, the area of the hole is four times the area of the cut in one layer. If the cut in one layer is a line segment (area zero), then the hole would be four line segments, which isn&#39;t a hole. But in reality, the cut has width, so if you&#39;re removing a portion, the area would be four times that portion. But since we&#39;re dealing with a straight cut (assumed to be a line segment), how does that translate?Wait, perhaps the confusion is between cutting a slit versus cutting out a region. If the cut is a straight line, it doesn&#39;t remove any area, it just creates a slit. But the problem says a hole was obtained, so it must have removed a region. Therefore, the cut must have width, but the problem says a straight cut. Maybe the cut is a straight line, and upon unfolding, the overlapping slits form a square hole.But without a diagram, it&#39;s challenging. However, according to the options and the most plausible answer, given that cutting through four layers with a midline cut would remove 1/4 of the original area, the answer is likely 1/4. However, the coordinate approach suggested it&#39;s 1/2. But the problem states that after unfolding, a square hole is obtained in the middle. The area connecting the midpoints is a square of area 2, which is 1/2, but this is a diamond shape. If the hole is a square aligned with the original square, then its area would be 1, which is 1/4. But how to determine which it is.Wait, when you fold the square twice along the diagonals and make a cut parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints, upon unfolding, the cuts are along the lines that form the square connecting the midpoints. Hence, the hole is that square, which has area 2 in a 4-area square, hence 1/2. But this contradicts the previous answer. But the answer isn&#39;t 1/2. Alternatively, maybe the hole is smaller.Wait, the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse and passes through the midpoints of the legs. In the folded triangle, which is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1 (assuming original square of side 2), the midline is at half the legs, so the cut is a line parallel to the hypotenuse at a distance of 0.5 from the right angle. This line forms a smaller triangle with legs 0.5, and area 0.125. The remaining trapezoid has area 0.875. If this is removed, then the hole area is 0.875 *4= 3.5, which is impossible. So clearly, this approach is wrong.Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you fold the square twice, the resulting figure is a triangle, and the cut removes a shape that, when unfolded, is a square. The key is that the cut is made in such a way that it is equidistant from the center in all directions. Hence, the hole is a square whose side is half the original square&#39;s side. Therefore, area is (1)^2 =1, original area 4, so 1/4. Hence, option (e).Given the conflicting methods and the answer options, I think the answer is (e) 1/4. However, I recall that when you fold a square paper into four layers and cut a small square in the center, the hole is 1/4 of the original. But in this case, the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse through midpoints, which should create a larger hole. But due to the folding, it might be 1/4.Alternatively, the area of the hole is 1/4, so the answer is (e).Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;The problem involves folding a square sheet twice along its diagonals, resulting in a triangle. A straight cut is made parallel to the larger side (hypotenuse) of this triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. When unfolded, a square hole is obtained in the middle. We need to determine the fraction of the original square&#39;s area that this hole represents.1. Folding the Square:   - The original square is folded along one diagonal, resulting in a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the side length of the square.   - Folding again along the other diagonal results in a smaller triangle with legs half the length of the original square&#39;s side.2. Making the Cut:   - The cut is made parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side) of the folded triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other two sides (legs).   - This cut is a midline of the triangle, forming a smaller triangle and a trapezoid.3. Unfolding the Sheet:   - When unfolded, the cuts made on the folded triangle result in a square hole in the center of the original square.   - The hole is formed by the intersection of the cuts from each fold, creating a square whose side length is half of the original square&#39;s side.4. Calculating the Area:   - If the original square has a side length of 2 units, the hole is a square with side length 1 unit.   - The area of the hole is (1 times 1 = 1) square unit.   - The area of the original square is (2 times 2 = 4) square units.   - The fraction of the area of the hole relative to the original square is (frac{1}{4}).Thus, the area of the hole corresponds to (frac{1}{4}) of the area of the original square sheet.[boxed{E}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out what fraction of the original square&#39;s area the hole takes up after folding and cutting. Let me try to visualize this step by step. First, the problem says a square sheet was folded twice along its diagonals, resulting in a triangle. Hmm, folding a square along both diagonals... Let me recall. If you fold a square along one diagonal, you get a triangle. Then folding it again along the other diagonal? Wait, but if it&#39;s already folded along one diagonal, folding along the other might just make a smaller triangle. Let me confirm.Suppose the original square has side length 2 units for simplicity, so area is 4. When you fold along one diagonal, the resulting triangle has legs of length 2√2? Wait, no. Wait, the sides of the triangle after folding along a diagonal would be the sides of the square. Wait, no. Let me think. If the square has side length 2, each side is 2. The diagonal is 2√2. But when you fold along the diagonal, the resulting triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the sides of the square, which are 2 each, and hypotenuse the diagonal. Wait, that&#39;s correct. So, folding a square along its diagonal gives a right-angled isoceles triangle with legs of length 2. Then folding it again along the other diagonal. Wait, but in the triangle, the other diagonal would be from the right angle to the hypotenuse. But folding along that would bring the two legs together. Hmm, maybe I need to draw this mentally.Alternatively, maybe folding twice along the diagonals means folding along each diagonal once, resulting in a quarter of the original square? Wait, no. If you fold a square along one diagonal, then fold the resulting triangle along the other diagonal (the original square&#39;s other diagonal), then you would have a smaller triangle. Let me see: original square with vertices A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s say you fold along diagonal AC, bringing B to D. Then you have triangle ACD. Then folding along diagonal BD? But BD was the original diagonal. Wait, maybe not. Wait, after the first fold along AC, the figure is triangle ACD with AC as the hypotenuse. The other diagonal of the original square was BD. But in the triangle ACD, BD is not present anymore. Wait, perhaps after folding along AC, the remaining triangle has vertices A, C, and D. Then folding along the other diagonal BD isn&#39;t possible because BD is now inside the folded layers. Maybe the second fold is along the diagonal of the resulting triangle. So, the triangle ACD is a right-angled triangle with legs AD and CD (each of length 2) and hypotenuse AC. Then folding it along its own altitude from the right angle D to hypotenuse AC. Wait, but the problem states &quot;folded twice along its diagonals&quot;. The original square&#39;s diagonals are AC and BD. So folding along AC first, then along BD. But BD is not a diagonal of the triangle ACD. Maybe after folding along AC, the square is now a triangle, and then folding along BD would mean something else. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, maybe folding the square along both diagonals, one after the other, regardless of the intermediate steps. So first along one diagonal, then along the other. Each fold would halve the area. So after two folds, the area would be 1/4 of the original. But the problem says &quot;resulting in a triangle&quot;. Wait, folding a square along one diagonal gives a triangle. Then folding that triangle along another line (which they say is the other diagonal, but maybe that&#39;s the triangle&#39;s own diagonal). Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.Original square, fold along diagonal AC: becomes triangle ABC (assuming square ABCD with AB, BC, CD, DA as sides). Wait, actually, if you fold along diagonal AC, the square becomes a triangle with vertices A, B, and C? No, folding along AC would collapse the square into triangle ACD, right? Wait, I need to fix my mental model.Let me name the square&#39;s vertices as follows: let the square be ABCD, with AB, BC, CD, DA as the sides, and diagonals AC and BD. If we fold along diagonal AC, then point B is folded over to point D. So the resulting figure is triangle ACD. Then folding along diagonal BD? But BD is not present in the folded triangle. Alternatively, after folding along AC, BD is now a line from D to the midpoint of AC? Maybe. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second fold is along the diagonal of the folded triangle. The folded triangle after the first fold is a right-angled triangle with legs of length equal to the side of the square, say 2. Then the hypotenuse is 2√2. Then the second fold is along the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. But the problem says &quot;folded twice along its diagonals&quot;, so maybe the second fold is along the original square&#39;s other diagonal. But in the folded triangle, the other diagonal is now inside the layers.This is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach. Let&#39;s suppose the square is folded along both diagonals, resulting in a triangle. Each fold along a diagonal divides the square into two triangles. Folding twice would divide it into four triangles? But the problem says &quot;resulting in a triangle&quot;, so maybe folding along both diagonals in such a way that the final shape is a triangle. Hmm. Maybe the folding is not along the two diagonals of the original square, but along the two diagonals of the resulting triangles. Wait, but the problem says &quot;folded twice along its diagonals&quot;, so &quot;its&quot; refers to the square&#39;s diagonals.Alternatively, maybe the first fold is along one diagonal, resulting in a triangle, then the second fold is along the diagonal of that triangle. The diagonal of a triangle is not a standard term, but maybe the median or altitude. Wait, the triangle after folding is a right-angled isoceles triangle. So if we fold it along its altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, that would be the same as folding along the perpendicular bisector. Then the result would be a smaller triangle.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to folding a square into quarters by folding along both diagonals. If you fold a square along one diagonal, then fold the resulting triangle along the other diagonal (of the original square), you end up with a quarter of the original square. But that would be a smaller triangle. But the problem says &quot;resulting in a triangle&quot;. So maybe after two folds, it&#39;s still a triangle. Wait, folding along two diagonals... Maybe if you fold along one diagonal, then fold along the other diagonal without unfolding, the result is a smaller triangle. Let&#39;s think.Original square: ABCD, with diagonals AC and BD. Fold along AC, so the square becomes triangle ABC (but actually, folding along AC would bring B to D, so the triangle is ACD). Then fold along BD. But BD is now inside the folded triangle. So folding along BD would mean folding the triangle ACD along a line that was the original BD. Since BD in the original square intersects AC at the center. So after folding along AC, BD is now a line from D to the midpoint of AC. So folding along BD would bring point A to the midpoint of AC. Hmm. Maybe. Alternatively, maybe after folding along AC, BD is now a crease that goes from the folded point (originally B, now at D) to the midpoint of AC. So folding along that crease would create another fold. This is getting too vague. Maybe it&#39;s better to consider coordinates.Let me assign coordinates to the square. Let the square have vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). Diagonals are from (0,0) to (2,2) and (0,2) to (2,0). First fold along the diagonal from (0,0) to (2,2). This fold maps (x,y) to (y,x). So points above the diagonal are folded below. The resulting shape is the triangle with vertices (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, no, folding along the diagonal (0,0)-(2,2) would collapse the square into the lower triangle. So the folded triangle is (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Then folding along the other diagonal, which is (0,2)-(2,0). But in the folded triangle, this diagonal would be from (0,2) to (2,0), but (0,2) is not part of the folded triangle. Wait, the folded triangle after the first fold is (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). The other diagonal in the original square is from (0,2) to (2,0), which is the line y = -x + 2. But in the folded triangle, this line would pass through (2,0) and (1,1). Wait, (1,1) is the midpoint of the diagonal (0,0)-(2,2). So folding along the line from (2,0) to (1,1). If I fold the triangle along this line, what happens?Alternatively, maybe after the first fold, the square is a triangle, and the second fold is along the remaining diagonal of the original square. But since the square is folded, the second diagonal is now a line inside the folded triangle. Folding along that would create another layer. Hmm. Maybe this results in a smaller triangle with 1/4 the area. But the problem says after folding twice, you make a straight cut parallel to the larger side of the triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. Then when you unfold, there&#39;s a square hole in the middle.Alternatively, let&#39;s consider the final result: when you unfold, the hole is a square in the middle. The area of the hole is some fraction of the original. The options are 1/2, 1/6, 3/8, 3/4, 1/4. Hmm. Let&#39;s think of symmetry. If the hole is in the center, likely it&#39;s 1/4 or 1/2. But let&#39;s see.Alternatively, maybe each fold divides the square into halves, so folding twice divides into quarters. Then the cut is made in the folded state, which is a triangle. The cut is parallel to the larger side (the hypotenuse) of the triangle, passing through the midpoints of the other sides. So in the folded triangle, which is a right-angled triangle, the larger side is the hypotenuse. So the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse and passes through the midpoints of the legs. So this cut would create a smaller similar triangle at the top and a trapezoid at the bottom. When you unfold, this cut would translate into a square hole in the center.Wait, let&#39;s think of the triangle after two folds. If the original square is folded along both diagonals, the resulting shape is a right-angled triangle with legs of length equal to half the original square&#39;s side? Or maybe not. Wait, let&#39;s take the original square of side length 2. After folding along one diagonal, it&#39;s a triangle with legs 2. Then folding along the other diagonal (assuming we can do that), but perhaps this fold is along the other diagonal of the original square. Wait, but in the folded triangle, where is the other diagonal? Maybe after folding along the first diagonal, the second fold is along the line that was the other diagonal in the original square. Let&#39;s use coordinates again.Original square: (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). Fold along diagonal (0,0)-(2,2). Now, the square is folded into triangle (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). The other diagonal is from (0,2) to (2,0), which is the line y = -x + 2. In the folded triangle, this line goes from (2,0) to (1,1). So folding along that line would bring the point (0,0) to (2,2). Wait, maybe. So folding the triangle along the line from (2,0) to (1,1) would create another fold. The result would be a smaller triangle with vertices at (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Hmm, but not sure.Alternatively, after two folds, the shape is a triangle that is 1/4 the size of the original square. So if the original area is 4, the folded triangle has area 1. Then a cut is made parallel to the larger side (the hypotenuse of the folded triangle), passing through the midpoints of the other sides. So in this small triangle, the legs are of length 1 (if the folded triangle is 1/4 the original). The hypotenuse would be √2. The midpoints of the legs would be at (0.5,0) and (0.5,0.5) or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.Wait, let&#39;s take the original square as 2x2. Fold along diagonal AC: area becomes 2. Then fold along diagonal BD: area becomes 1. So the folded triangle is 1/4 of the original square. Then the triangle has legs of length √2, since the original square&#39;s diagonal is 2√2, but after folding twice, maybe the legs are 1 each. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe an alternative approach.When you fold a square along its two diagonals, you end up with a triangle that&#39;s 1/4 of the original square. Then, when you make a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the longer side) through the midpoints of the legs, that cut would remove a small triangle from the folded piece. But when you unfold, due to the folding layers, this cut would create a shape in the center. Since the problem states that the hole is a square, the cuts must have been made such that when unfolded, the overlapping cuts form a square.Alternatively, maybe the cut is a straight line parallel to the hypotenuse of the folded triangle, passing through the midpoints of the legs. In a right-angled triangle, the midline parallel to the hypotenuse is half its length. So the hole&#39;s side would be half the hypotenuse. But when unfolded, how does that translate?Wait, let&#39;s think step by step. Suppose the original square has side length 2. Area is 4. Fold along one diagonal: now we have a triangle with legs 2 each, area 2. Fold along the other diagonal: now we have a smaller triangle, area 1. The hypotenuse of the final folded triangle is the original square&#39;s side, which is 2. Wait, no. If we fold a 2x2 square along one diagonal, the hypotenuse is 2√2. Then folding along the other diagonal, which would be folding the triangle along its own altitude. The altitude of a right-angled triangle with legs 2 and hypotenuse 2√2 is (2*2)/2√2 = 2/√2 = √2. So the altitude is √2. Folding along that altitude would create a smaller triangle with legs √2 each. So the final folded triangle has legs of √2, hypotenuse 2. Then, making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (which is 2) passing through the midpoints of the other sides (the legs of length √2). The midpoints of the legs would be at (√2/2) from the right angle. So the cut is a line parallel to the hypotenuse, √2/2 distance from the right angle. This would create a smaller similar triangle on top and a trapezoid at the bottom. The length of this cut would be half the hypotenuse, since it&#39;s a midline. So the length is 1. When you unfold this cut, because of the folding layers, the hole would be a square. Let&#39;s see.When you make a cut of length 1 in the folded triangle (which is 1/4 of the original square), but considering the folding, each layer would have this cut. Since the fold was along both diagonals, the cut would be replicated in all four quadrants of the original square. Therefore, the hole would be a square in the center with side length 1 (since the original square was 2x2). So the area of the hole is 1x1=1, and the original area is 4, so the fraction is 1/4. But wait, option (e) is 1/4. But the answer might not be that. Wait, maybe my reasoning is flawed.Alternatively, perhaps the length of the cut is different. If the folded triangle has legs of length √2, and the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse (length 2) at the midpoints of the legs (√2/2 from the right angle), then the length of the cut is the midline of the triangle, which is half the hypotenuse, so 1. Therefore, when unfolded, this would create a square hole with side length 1. But the original square is 2x2, so the area ratio is 1/4. But the answer choice (e) is 1/4, but wait, let me check again.But maybe my assumption of the side length is causing confusion. Let the original square have side length 1. Area is 1. Folding along the two diagonals would result in a triangle with area 1/4. Then making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints. The midline in a triangle is half the hypotenuse. So the length of the cut is 1/2 (since hypotenuse of the folded triangle would be √2/2). Wait, no. If original square is 1x1, diagonal is √2. Folding along diagonal gives a triangle with legs 1 and hypotenuse √2. Then folding along the other diagonal (but again, maybe the altitude). The altitude is (1*1)/√2 = 1/√2. So folding along the altitude gives a smaller triangle with legs 1/√2 and hypotenuse 1. Then the midline cut parallel to the hypotenuse would be half of 1, which is 1/2. So the hole&#39;s length is 1/2. When unfolded, this would create a square hole of side 1/2. Area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Original area is 1, so ratio is 1/4. But the answer is option (e). However, the options don&#39;t have 1/4 as correct? Wait, yes, option (e) is 1/4. But the problem states that after unfolding, the hole is a square in the middle. So if the hole&#39;s area is 1/4 of the original, then the answer is (e). But wait, maybe my calculation is wrong.Wait, if the original square is 1x1, and the hole is (1/2)x(1/2), area 1/4. But when you fold along diagonals twice, the cut is made once, but due to folding, the cut is replicated four times? Wait, no. Each fold doubles the number of layers. So folding twice would result in 4 layers. Therefore, the cut goes through four layers, so when you unfold, there are four holes? Wait, but the problem says a single square hole. So maybe the cut in the folded state creates a single hole that, when unfolded, becomes a square in the center. So perhaps the area calculation is different.Alternatively, consider that when you make a cut through four layers, the area of the hole is four times the area of the cut. Wait, but if you cut a hole in four layers, when you unfold, you have four holes. But the problem states there&#39;s a single square hole. So perhaps the cut is made in such a way that it creates a single hole when considering the symmetry. Maybe the cut is along a line that, when unfolded, connects through the center.Alternatively, let me try another approach. When you fold a square along both diagonals, the center of the square is the intersection point of the diagonals. Making a cut parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side of the triangle) through the midpoints of the other sides. In the folded triangle, the larger side is the hypotenuse. The midpoints of the other two sides (the legs) – so if the legs are of length &#39;a&#39;, then the midpoints are at a/2. A cut parallel to the hypotenuse through these midpoints would form a smaller similar triangle on top and a trapezoid below. The length of this cut is a/2 * √2 (since in a right-angled isoceles triangle, the hypotenuse is a√2, so the midline parallel to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse length, which is (a√2)/2). Wait, maybe not. The midline theorem states that the midline is half the hypotenuse. So if the legs are length &#39;a&#39;, hypotenuse is a√2, midline is (a√2)/2. Then, the area of the hole would be the area of the small triangle, which is ( (a√2)/2 )² / 2 = ( (2a²)/4 ) / 2 = (a²/2)/2 = a²/4. But the original triangle has area a²/2, so the hole is 1/2 of the folded triangle&#39;s area. But since the folded triangle is 1/4 of the original square, the hole is 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8 of the original area. But that&#39;s not an option here. Hmm. This is confusing.Wait, maybe the hole is not the area of the cut-out piece, but the area of the hole in the original square. When you make a cut through all layers, the total area removed is the number of layers multiplied by the area of the cut. But if you fold the square twice, you have four layers. So if you make a cut that removes a piece of area &#39;x&#39; from the folded triangle, the total area removed from the original square is 4x. Then the hole&#39;s area is 4x. So if in the folded triangle (which is 1/4 of the original area), the cut removes a trapezoid or a triangle. Wait, in the folded state, the cut is parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints of the legs. In a right-angled triangle, cutting parallel to the hypotenuse through the midpoints of the legs would create a smaller triangle similar to the original. The smaller triangle would have half the height, so its area is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original folded triangle. So the area removed is 1/4 of the folded triangle&#39;s area. The folded triangle&#39;s area is 1/4 of the original square, so the hole area is 4 * (1/4 * 1/4) = 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. Wait, this seems to match. Wait, if the folded triangle has area 1/4 of the original, and the cut removes 1/4 of that, so 1/16 of the original. But since there are four layers, the total area removed is 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. Therefore, the hole is 1/4 of the original area. So the answer is (e) 1/4. But let me confirm.Original area: 1. Fold along two diagonals: folded triangle area 1/4. Cut removes a triangle of area 1/4 of the folded triangle, which is 1/16. But since the folded triangle has four layers (because of two folds), cutting through all four layers removes 4*(1/16) = 1/4. Therefore, the hole&#39;s area is 1/4. So the answer is (e) 1/4. However, the problem states that after unfolding, a square hole is obtained. If the hole is 1/4 of the original area, that would mean the hole is a square with side length half of the original, since (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So if the original square is of side 2, the hole is 1x1. But in the middle. That seems plausible. Therefore, the answer should be (e) 1/4.But wait, the answer options include (e) 1/4. However, I recall that when you fold a square into quarters and make a cut, the area removed is multiplied by the number of layers. So in this case, two folds give four layers. If the cut removes a certain area in the folded state, the actual hole is four times that. But earlier calculation suggested that cutting 1/4 of the folded triangle (which is 1/4 of original) gives 1/16 per layer, times 4 layers is 1/4. Alternatively, if in the folded state (the triangle with area 1/4), the cut removes a shape whose area is x, then total hole area is 4x. If the hole is a square, x must be a square in the folded state. Wait, but the cut is a straight line parallel to the hypotenuse, passing through the midpoints of the legs. This would remove a trapezoidal shape from the folded triangle. But when unfolded, due to the folding layers, this becomes a square.Alternatively, perhaps the length of the cut in the folded triangle corresponds to the side of the square hole. If the original square is 2x2, folded into a triangle with legs 2, hypotenuse 2√2. Cutting parallel to the hypotenuse through midpoints: this cut is a midline, so length √2. When unfolded, this cut becomes a square with side √2. But area would be (√2)^2 = 2, which is half of the original area 4. But 2/4 is 1/2, which is option (a). But this contradicts previous reasoning. Alternatively, maybe not.Wait, confusion arises from different ways of modeling the folds and cuts. Maybe a better approach is to consider coordinate geometry.Let’s model the original square with coordinates (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). Fold along diagonal AC: (0,0) to (2,2). The folded triangle is (0,0), (2,0), (2,2). Then fold along diagonal BD: (0,2) to (2,0). But in the folded triangle, BD is now a line from (2,0) to (1,1). Folding along this line would map the point (0,0) to (2,2). So the folded shape is a quadrilateral? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the second fold along BD in the original square, but since the first fold has already been made, the second fold is along the crease corresponding to BD. This is complex. Maybe it&#39;s easier to think in terms of transformations.Alternatively, when you fold the square along both diagonals, the center of the square (1,1) is the intersection point. The resulting folded shape is a triangle with vertices at the center and two corners. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe after folding along both diagonals, you end up with a triangle that is 1/4 the size. But how?Alternatively, think of folding the square along diagonal AC, then folding the result along diagonal BD. Each fold halves the area. So after two folds, the area is 1/4. The folded shape is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1 (assuming original square side 2), hypotenuse √2. Then a cut is made parallel to the hypotenuse (the longer side), passing through the midpoints of the legs. The midpoints are at (0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0.5). Wait, no. In the folded triangle with legs of 1, the midpoints of the legs would be at (0.5,0) and (1,0.5). A line parallel to the hypotenuse (which goes from (0,0) to (1,1)) would have a slope of 1. The line passing through (0.5,0) and (1,0.5) is y = x - 0.5. This line is parallel to the hypotenuse (y = x) and passes through the midpoints. Cutting along this line would remove a triangle from the folded shape. The length of this cut is the distance between (0.5,0) and (1,0.5), which is √[(0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2] = √(0.25 + 0.25) = √0.5 = √(1/2). When you unfold the paper, this cut becomes a diamond shape (square) in the center. The area of this square can be calculated.The distance between the cut and the hypotenuse in the folded triangle is the height. The original hypotenuse is length √2, and the cut is a line parallel to it at half the distance (since it passes through midpoints). The area between the hypotenuse and the cut is a similar triangle with scale factor 1/2, so area 1/4 of the original folded triangle. But the original folded triangle has area 1/4 of the original square, so the area of the cut-out part is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. However, since the paper was folded into four layers, the total area removed is 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. Thus, the hole is 1/4 of the original area. Therefore, the answer is (e) 1/4.But I need to ensure this is correct. Let&#39;s cross-verify. Original area 4, hole area 1. If the original square is 2x2, and the hole is 1x1 in the center, that&#39;s 1/4 the area. Yes. Therefore, the answer should be (e) 1/4.Final Answerboxed{E}&lt;/think&gt;To determine the fraction of the original square&#39;s area that the hole occupies, we need to analyze the folding and cutting process step by step.1. Folding the Square:   - The square is first folded along one diagonal, resulting in a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs equal to the side length of the square.   - The square is then folded along the other diagonal, resulting in a smaller right-angled isosceles triangle. Each fold halves the area, so after two folds, the area is ( frac{1}{4} ) of the original square.2. Making the Cut:   - In the folded state (a smaller triangle), a straight cut is made parallel to the hypotenuse (the larger side) and passing through the midpoints of the other two sides. This cut creates a smaller similar triangle and a trapezoid.3. Unfolding the Square:   - When the folded sheet is unfolded, the cut results in a square hole in the center of the original square. The cut, when mirrored across the folds, forms a square.4. Calculating the Area:   - The original square is divided into four congruent triangles by the two diagonal folds. The cut in the folded state affects all four layers, resulting in a square hole.   - The side length of the hole is half the side length of the original square. If the original square has side length ( 2 ), the hole has side length ( 1 ), resulting in an area of ( 1 times 1 = 1 ).   - The area of the original square is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ). The fraction of the area of the hole relative to the original square is ( frac{1}{4} ).Thus, the area of the hole corresponds to ( frac{1}{4} ) of the area of the entire original square sheet.[boxed{E}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-276ea2c2></div><p class="review-content" data-v-276ea2c2><span class="icon" data-v-276ea2c2>🔑:</span>The correct option is (e).Solution 1: Let triangle A B C be the triangle obtained after folding the original square along its two diagonals, and let M N be the cut along the mid-base of this triangle, parallel to the side B C, which is one of the sides of the original square. The area of the original square is(B C)^{2}. Unfolding the sheet, we see that the hole is a square with side M N and, since M N=frac{1}{2} B C, its area is(M N)^{2}=left(frac{1}{2} B Cright)^{2}=frac{1}{4}(B C)^{2}Thus, the hole has one quarter of the area of the original square.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_30c9a294a58a6e4b8190g-040.jpg?height=408&amp;width=1264&amp;top_left_y=617&amp;top_left_x=434)Solution 2: The cut is made along the mid-base of the triangle, removing a small triangle similar to the original, with a similarity ratio of 1 / 2. Thus, the area of the removed triangle is one quarter of the area of the original triangle. Unfolding the sheet, we see this situation repeated four times, so the hole has one quarter of the area of the original square.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-2fed70db><span data-v-2fed70db>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
