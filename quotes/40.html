Let me start by recalling the general equation of a circle: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. The problem states that the center is in the first quadrant, so both h and k must be positive. First, let&#39;s parse the information given. The circle has a chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin O, and that chord has a length of 6. Also, the circle is tangent to the line 3x + y = 0. Starting with the chord part. If the x-axis intersects the circle to form a chord passing through the origin, that means the origin is a point on the chord. The chord&#39;s length is 6. So, the x-axis cuts the circle at two points, and the distance between these two points is 6. Let me visualize this: the x-axis is horizontal, and the chord is along the x-axis from some point A to point B, with O (the origin) lying on this chord. But wait, the origin is (0,0). So if the chord passes through the origin and lies on the x-axis, then the chord is the x-axis itself between points (-3, 0) and (3, 0), but centered at the origin? Wait, but the chord length is 6, so the distance between the two points where the circle intersects the x-axis would be 6. So, the x-axis is a secant line to the circle, cutting it at two points 6 units apart. The chord is along the x-axis, passing through the origin, with length 6. Hmm. But if the chord is through the origin, then the origin is one of the points on the chord. Wait, no. If the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin, maybe that means the x-axis passes through the origin and intersects the circle in two points, forming a chord of length 6. So the x-axis is a secant line passing through the origin, cutting the circle at two points, say, points A and B, with AB = 6. Then, since the x-axis passes through the origin, one of the points A or B could be the origin, but the chord length is 6. Wait, but if the chord passes through the origin, then the origin is inside the circle? Or maybe not. Let me think.Wait, if the origin is on the chord, then the chord is passing through the origin. So the chord is a line that passes through the origin and intersects the circle at two points, and the distance between those two points is 6. But the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. Wait, maybe that means the x-axis is the line that contains the chord, which passes through the origin, so the chord is along the x-axis. Therefore, the x-axis intersects the circle at two points, say (a, 0) and (b, 0), and the distance between them is 6. So |a - b| = 6. But if the x-axis passes through the origin, then the chord is along the x-axis, so the two intersection points are (a, 0) and (b, 0), and since it&#39;s passing through the origin, one of them is the origin? Wait, if the chord passes through the origin, then the origin is one of the endpoints? But then the length would be from the origin to another point, so the length would be |a - 0| = |a| = 6, so the other point is (6, 0) or (-6, 0). But if the center is in the first quadrant, then the circle is more likely to intersect the x-axis at two points both to the right of the origin? Wait, but the x-axis is passing through the origin, so if the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin, maybe the chord is the segment from (0,0) to another point on the x-axis, but that would only be a chord if the origin is on the circle. Wait, but if the origin is on the circle, then the radius would be equal to the distance from the center to the origin. Hmm, maybe not necessarily. Let me clarify.Alternatively, the chord is the segment intercepted by the x-axis, meaning the x-axis cuts the circle at two points, forming a chord of length 6, and this chord passes through the origin. So the x-axis is a secant line of the circle passing through the origin, with the two intersection points 6 units apart. So the points are (x1, 0) and (x2, 0), with |x1 - x2| = 6, and the origin (0,0) lies on the chord. So that would mean that the origin is between x1 and x2. Therefore, if the chord is along the x-axis with length 6 and passing through the origin, then the two points where the circle intersects the x-axis are (-3, 0) and (3, 0). Wait, that would make sense. Because then the distance between (-3, 0) and (3, 0) is 6, and the origin is the midpoint. But is the origin necessarily the midpoint? If the chord passes through the origin, then the origin is a point on the chord, but not necessarily the midpoint. However, if the chord is along the x-axis, then the chord is the x-axis itself between two points. If the chord passes through the origin, then the origin is on the chord. So unless the origin is one of the endpoints, which would make the length from the origin to the other endpoint 6. But that would mean the other endpoint is at (6,0) or (-6,0). But then the chord would be from (0,0) to (6,0), length 6. But the problem says the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. Hmm. Maybe the chord is the intercept between the circle and the x-axis, passing through the origin. Therefore, the x-axis intersects the circle at two points, with the origin lying on that chord (i.e., the x-axis). So the chord is the set of points on the x-axis that are also on the circle. Therefore, the two intersection points between the circle and the x-axis are separated by 6 units, and the origin is one of those points? Or is the origin somewhere else on the chord?Wait, if the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin, maybe it&#39;s saying that the chord is the one that&#39;s created when the x-axis passes through the origin and cuts the circle, creating a chord of length 6. Therefore, the x-axis is a secant line passing through the origin, intersecting the circle at two points, and the distance between those two points is 6. Therefore, the points are (a, 0) and (b, 0) with |a - b| = 6. The origin is on the x-axis, so the origin is either one of these points or between them. If the origin is between them, then a and b are opposites in sign, and |a - b| = 6. For example, if the points are (-3, 0) and (3, 0), then | -3 - 3 | = 6. But if the origin is one of the points, then the other point would be (6, 0) or (-6, 0). But since the center is in the first quadrant, the circle is likely in the first quadrant, so the intersection points with the x-axis might both be positive. But the origin is in the first quadrant? Wait, no. The origin is at (0,0), which is on the boundary of all quadrants. But if the center is in the first quadrant, the circle could intersect the x-axis at two positive x-values, or one positive and one negative. However, if the chord passes through the origin, then the origin is on the chord. So if the chord is along the x-axis, passing through the origin, and the circle intersects the x-axis at two points: one at the origin and another at (6, 0), so the chord would be from (0,0) to (6,0), length 6. But then the origin is on the circle. Alternatively, the chord could pass through the origin but not have the origin as an endpoint. For example, if the chord is between (-3,0) and (3,0), passing through the origin as the midpoint. But in that case, the origin would be inside the circle. Wait, but if the origin is inside the circle, then the distance from the center to the origin is less than the radius. Hmm. Let&#39;s think about both possibilities.Case 1: The origin is one of the endpoints of the chord. So the circle passes through the origin and another point (6,0), forming a chord of length 6 on the x-axis. Then, the distance between the center (h, k) and the origin is sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = radius. Also, the distance from the center to (6,0) is sqrt((h - 6)^2 + k^2) = radius. Therefore, sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = sqrt((h - 6)^2 + k^2). Squaring both sides: h^2 + k^2 = (h - 6)^2 + k^2 =&gt; h^2 = h^2 - 12h + 36 =&gt; 0 = -12h + 36 =&gt; 12h = 36 =&gt; h = 3. So the center is at (3, k). But then the radius is sqrt(3^2 + k^2) = sqrt(9 + k^2). Also, the circle is tangent to the line 3x + y = 0. The distance from the center (3, k) to the line 3x + y = 0 must be equal to the radius. The formula for distance from a point (h, k) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ah + bk + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So here, the line is 3x + y = 0, so a=3, b=1, c=0. Distance is |3*3 + 1*k + 0| / sqrt(9 + 1) = |9 + k| / sqrt(10). This distance must equal the radius, which is sqrt(9 + k^2). So:|9 + k| / sqrt(10) = sqrt(9 + k^2)Squaring both sides:(81 + 18k + k^2) / 10 = 9 + k^2Multiply both sides by 10:81 + 18k + k^2 = 90 + 10k^2Bring all terms to left:81 + 18k + k^2 - 90 - 10k^2 = 0Simplify:-9k^2 + 18k - 9 = 0Divide by -9:k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0Which factors as (k - 1)^2 = 0 =&gt; k = 1Therefore, center is (3, 1), radius sqrt(9 + 1) = sqrt(10). Let&#39;s check if this works. The circle equation is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10. Check if it intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (6,0). Plugging y=0:(x - 3)^2 + 1 = 10 =&gt; (x - 3)^2 = 9 =&gt; x - 3 = ±3 =&gt; x = 6 or 0. Yes, so the chord from (0,0) to (6,0) has length 6. Also, check the tangent condition. The distance from (3,1) to 3x + y =0 is |9 +1| / sqrt(10) = 10/sqrt(10) = sqrt(10), which equals the radius. So this seems to check out. But wait, the problem states that the center is in the first quadrant, which (3,1) is. So is this the answer? Wait, but the problem says the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. In this case, the chord is between (0,0) and (6,0), passing through the origin as one endpoint. So that&#39;s one possibility.But let&#39;s check the other case where the origin is inside the chord, i.e., the chord is from (-3,0) to (3,0), passing through the origin as the midpoint. Then, the length is 6. In this case, the circle intersects the x-axis at (-3,0) and (3,0). Then, the center (h, k) is in the first quadrant, so h &gt;0, k&gt;0. The distance from the center to the x-axis is k, so the radius must satisfy k &lt; radius. Because the circle intersects the x-axis at two points, the distance from the center to the x-axis (which is k) must be less than the radius. Then, using the equation of the circle, the x-intercepts can be found by setting y=0:(x - h)^2 + k^2 = r^2 =&gt; (x - h)^2 = r^2 - k^2Therefore, the x-intercepts are at h ± sqrt(r^2 - k^2). The distance between the two intercepts is 2*sqrt(r^2 - k^2) = 6 =&gt; sqrt(r^2 - k^2) = 3 =&gt; r^2 - k^2 = 9.Also, since the circle is tangent to the line 3x + y =0, the distance from the center (h,k) to this line must equal the radius. The distance is |3h + k| / sqrt(10) = r. Therefore, we have two equations:1. r^2 - k^2 = 92. |3h + k| / sqrt(10) = rAdditionally, since the center is in the first quadrant, h &gt;0 and k&gt;0. Let&#39;s square the second equation to eliminate the absolute value (since 3h + k is positive because h and k are positive):(3h + k)^2 / 10 = r^2But from the first equation, r^2 = 9 + k^2. Substitute:(3h + k)^2 / 10 = 9 + k^2Multiply both sides by 10:(3h + k)^2 = 90 + 10k^2Expand the left side:9h^2 + 6hk + k^2 = 90 + 10k^2Bring all terms to left:9h^2 + 6hk + k^2 - 90 -10k^2 = 0Simplify:9h^2 + 6hk -9k^2 -90 =0Divide all terms by 9:h^2 + (2/3)hk - k^2 -10 =0Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me check if there&#39;s another relationship. Since the x-intercepts are at h ± sqrt(r^2 - k^2) = h ± 3. Therefore, the two intercepts are (h +3, 0) and (h -3, 0). But if these are (-3, 0) and (3, 0), then h +3 =3 and h -3 = -3. So h =0. But the center is supposed to be in the first quadrant, so h&gt;0. Therefore, this is impossible. Hence, the intercepts can&#39;t be (-3,0) and (3,0) if the center is in the first quadrant. Therefore, the intercepts must both be to the right of the origin. So h -3 must be positive, so h &gt;3. Then, the intercepts are (h -3, 0) and (h +3, 0), both in positive x-axis. Then the origin is not on the chord. Wait, but the problem says the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. So the chord must pass through the origin. If the intercepts are (h -3, 0) and (h +3, 0), and the chord is between these two points, then the chord is along the x-axis from (h -3,0) to (h +3,0), which is a horizontal line. If this chord passes through the origin, then the origin must lie on this chord. Therefore, (0,0) must be between (h -3,0) and (h +3,0). Therefore, h -3 &lt;0 and h +3 &gt;0. Since h &gt;0 (center in first quadrant), h -3 &lt;0 implies h &lt;3. Therefore, h is between 0 and3. But the intercepts would be (h -3,0) which is negative, and (h +3,0) which is positive. Therefore, the chord from (h -3,0) to (h +3,0) passes through the origin. So the length is 6, as required. Therefore, in this case, the x-intercepts are (h -3,0) and (h +3,0), with h &lt;3, but since h &gt;0, it&#39;s 0 &lt;h &lt;3. Then, the center is (h, k) with h in (0,3), k &gt;0.So, from this, the radius squared is (h - (h -3))^2 + (0 -k)^2 = (3)^2 + k^2 = 9 + k^2. Wait, no. The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle, so for example, to (h +3, 0):sqrt( (h +3 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 ) = sqrt(3^2 + k^2) = sqrt(9 + k^2). So radius squared is 9 + k^2.Additionally, the circle is tangent to the line 3x + y =0. So the distance from center (h,k) to this line is equal to the radius. As before, distance is |3h + k| / sqrt(10) = sqrt(9 + k^2). So:|3h + k| = sqrt(10) * sqrt(9 + k^2)But since h and k are positive, 3h +k is positive, so we can drop the absolute value:3h +k = sqrt(10*(9 +k^2))Square both sides:(3h +k)^2 = 10*(9 +k^2)9h^2 +6hk +k^2 =90 +10k^29h^2 +6hk +k^2 -90 -10k^2=09h^2 +6hk -9k^2 -90=0Divide by 9:h^2 + (2/3)hk -k^2 -10=0This is the same equation as before. Hmm. So how do we solve this equation? Let&#39;s see. Let me rearrange:h^2 + (2/3)hk -k^2 =10Hmm, maybe we can express h in terms of k or vice versa. Let&#39;s attempt substitution. Let&#39;s assume that h is expressed as some multiple of k, but it&#39;s not obvious. Alternatively, multiply through by 3 to eliminate fractions:3h^2 +2hk -3k^2 -30=0Hmm. Let me write this as:3h^2 +2hk -3k^2 =30This is a quadratic in h. Let&#39;s treat k as a constant and solve for h:3h^2 +2hk - (3k^2 +30)=0Using quadratic formula:h = [-2k ± sqrt(4k^2 +4*3*(3k^2 +30))]/(2*3)Simplify discriminant:sqrt(4k^2 +12*(3k^2 +30)) = sqrt(4k^2 +36k^2 +360) = sqrt(40k^2 +360) = sqrt(40(k^2 +9)) = 2*sqrt(10(k^2 +9))Therefore,h = [-2k ± 2*sqrt(10(k^2 +9))]/6 = [-k ± sqrt(10(k^2 +9))]/3But since h&gt;0, we take the positive root:h = [ -k + sqrt(10(k^2 +9)) ] /3This looks complicated. Maybe there&#39;s another approach.Alternatively, let&#39;s recall that in this scenario, the x-intercepts are (h -3,0) and (h +3,0), and the origin lies on the chord, which is the x-axis between these two points. Therefore, the origin is between (h -3,0) and (h +3,0), so h -3 &lt;0 &lt;h +3. Since h&gt;0, this implies h &lt;3, as before.But how does this help us? Maybe we can consider the power of the origin with respect to the circle. The power of a point (x0,y0) with respect to the circle is (x0 -h)^2 + (y0 -k)^2 - r^2. For the origin (0,0), the power is h^2 + k^2 - r^2. If the origin lies on the chord, then the origin lies on the secant line, so the power of the origin is equal to the square of the tangent length from the origin to the circle. But if the origin is inside the circle, the power is negative, and if it&#39;s outside, positive. Wait, if the origin is on the chord, then it&#39;s inside the circle because the chord passes through the origin. Therefore, the power of the origin is negative, which implies h^2 +k^2 -r^2 &lt;0. But in our previous case where the origin was on the circle, h^2 +k^2 =r^2. But in the first case we considered, where the center was (3,1), the origin is on the circle because sqrt(3^2 +1^2)=sqrt(10)=radius. Therefore, in that case, the origin is on the circle, and the chord is from (0,0) to (6,0). So that is a valid case. But in the other case, where the origin is inside the circle, we have h^2 +k^2 -r^2 &lt;0. But since r^2 =9 +k^2, this implies h^2 +k^2 - (9 +k^2)=h^2 -9 &lt;0 =&gt; h^2 &lt;9 =&gt; h &lt;3, which is consistent with our previous conclusion. So the origin is inside the circle when h &lt;3.But in the first case, where h=3, the origin is on the circle. So both scenarios are possible, but the problem says the center is in the first quadrant, so h&gt;0 and k&gt;0. However, if the origin is on the circle, then h^2 +k^2 =r^2. In that case, with h=3, the equation (3,1) was found. But in the other case, where the origin is inside the circle, we have a different equation. So which one is the correct answer?The problem states that the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin has a length of 6. If the origin is on the circle, then the chord would be from the origin to another point, length 6, so that other point is (6,0). But in that case, the chord is just a radius, but actually, a chord passing through the origin would have the origin as one endpoint. However, a chord passing through the origin would have two endpoints on the circle. If the origin is on the circle, then the chord would have the origin as one endpoint and another point on the circle. But the problem says the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin has length 6, which would be the case if the x-axis intersects the circle at two points, with the origin lying on that chord. So the chord is the segment between the two intersection points, passing through the origin, with length 6.Therefore, the origin could be either inside the circle (so the chord passes through the origin as a secant line) or on the circle (so the chord is from the origin to another point). But the problem doesn&#39;t specify whether the origin is inside or on the circle. So both cases need to be considered.But in the first case, we found a valid circle with center (3,1) and radius sqrt(10). Let&#39;s check if that&#39;s tangent to the line 3x + y =0. The distance from (3,1) to 3x + y =0 is |9 +1|/sqrt(10)=10/sqrt(10)=sqrt(10), which equals the radius. So that works.In the other case, where the origin is inside the circle, we have a more complex equation. Let&#39;s see if we can find a solution there. So from the equation:3h^2 +2hk -3k^2 =30We need to find positive h and k satisfying this. Let&#39;s try to find integer solutions. Suppose h and k are integers. Let&#39;s test h=1:3(1)^2 +2(1)k -3k^2 =3 +2k -3k^2 =30So -3k^2 +2k +3 -30= -3k^2 +2k -27=0Multiply by -1: 3k^2 -2k +27=0. Discriminant: 4 - 324= -320 &lt;0. No solution.h=2:3(4) +2*2*k -3k^2=12 +4k -3k^2=30-3k^2 +4k +12 -30= -3k^2 +4k -18=0Multiply by -1: 3k^2 -4k +18=0. Discriminant:16 -216= -200 &lt;0. No solution.h=0. Not allowed.h=3 would be the previous case. h=4:3(16) +2*4*k -3k^2=48 +8k -3k^2=30-3k^2 +8k +48 -30= -3k^2 +8k +18=0Multiply by -1:3k^2 -8k -18=0. Discriminant=64 +216=280. sqrt(280)=2*sqrt(70). Not integer.Alternatively, maybe h and k are fractions. This approach might not be effective. Let me try substituting h from the first equation. Wait, in the case where the origin is inside the circle, we have:r^2 =9 +k^2, and 3h +k = sqrt(10*(9 +k^2))Let me denote sqrt(10*(9 +k^2))=sqrt(10r^2). So 3h +k= sqrt(10) rBut since r^2=9 +k^2, then sqrt(10) r =sqrt(10*(9 +k^2))=sqrt(90 +10k^2). Hmm.Alternatively, let me consider squaring the equation 3h +k =sqrt(10*(9 +k^2)) again:(3h +k)^2=10*(9 +k^2)So 9h^2 +6hk +k^2=90 +10k^2So 9h^2 +6hk -9k^2=90Divide by 9:h^2 + (2/3)hk -k^2=10Let me let m= h/k, then h= m k. Substitute:(m k)^2 + (2/3)(m k)(k) -k^2=10m^2 k^2 + (2/3)m k^2 -k^2=10Factor k^2:k^2(m^2 + (2/3)m -1)=10But this might not help. Alternatively, let&#39;s divide both sides by k^2:(m^2 + (2/3)m -1)=10/k^2But since h and k are positive, and m = h/k, m is positive. Let me set t= m + something. Not sure. Maybe this substitution isn&#39;t helpful. Let&#39;s think differently.Perhaps assume that the tangent line 3x + y=0 is tangent to the circle at some point, and use the condition for tangency. The tangent line will be perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. So if the circle is tangent to 3x + y=0 at point (p, q), then the vector from the center (h,k) to (p,q) is perpendicular to the direction vector of the line 3x + y=0. The direction vector of the line 3x + y=0 is (1, -3), since the line can be written as y= -3x. Therefore, the slope is -3, so direction vector is (1, -3). The radius vector from (h,k) to (p,q) must be perpendicular to (1, -3), so their dot product is zero:(p - h, q - k) ⋅ (1, -3) =0Therefore, (p - h) -3(q -k)=0 =&gt; p -h -3q +3k=0.But the point (p,q) lies on the line 3x + y=0, so 3p + q=0 =&gt; q= -3p.Substitute q= -3p into the previous equation:p -h -3*(-3p) +3k=0 =&gt; p -h +9p +3k=0 =&gt;10p -h +3k=0 =&gt;10p= h -3k =&gt; p=(h -3k)/10Then, q= -3p= -3(h -3k)/10= (-3h +9k)/10Also, the point (p,q) lies on the circle, so:(p - h)^2 + (q -k)^2 =r^2=9 +k^2Substitute p=(h -3k)/10 and q=(-3h +9k)/10:[( (h -3k)/10 - h )]^2 + [ ( (-3h +9k)/10 -k )]^2 =9 +k^2Simplify each term:First term: ( (h -3k -10h)/10 )^2 = ( (-9h -3k)/10 )^2 = ( -3(3h +k)/10 )^2 = 9(3h +k)^2 /100Second term: ( (-3h +9k -10k)/10 )^2 = ( (-3h -k)/10 )^2 = ( - (3h +k)/10 )^2 = (3h +k)^2 /100Therefore, adding both terms:[9(3h +k)^2 + (3h +k)^2]/100 = 10(3h +k)^2 /100 = (3h +k)^2 /10Set equal to 9 +k^2:(3h +k)^2 /10 =9 +k^2Multiply both sides by10:(3h +k)^2=90 +10k^2Which is the same equation as before. So this approach leads us back to the same equation. Therefore, we need to solve:9h^2 +6hk +k^2=90 +10k^2Simplify:9h^2 +6hk -9k^2 -90=0Same as before. Therefore, we must solve this equation with h&gt;0, k&gt;0, and h &lt;3 (since origin is inside the circle). Let&#39;s attempt to find real solutions. Let&#39;s rearrange the equation:9h^2 +6hk -9k^2=90Divide by 9:h^2 + (2/3)hk -k^2=10Let me consider h as a function of k. Let&#39;s rewrite the equation:h^2 + (2/3)hk - (k^2 +10)=0This is a quadratic in h:h^2 + (2/3)k h - (k^2 +10)=0Using the quadratic formula:h = [ - (2/3)k ± sqrt( (2/3k)^2 +4(k^2 +10) ) ] /2Calculate discriminant:( (4/9)k^2 ) +4k^2 +40 = (4/9 +4)k^2 +40 = (40/9)k^2 +40= (40/9)(k^2 +9)Therefore,h = [ - (2/3)k ± sqrt(40/9(k^2 +9)) ] /2= [ - (2/3)k ± (2/3)sqrt(10(k^2 +9)) ] /2Factor out (2/3)/2=1/3:= (1/3)[ -k ± sqrt(10(k^2 +9)) ]Since h&gt;0, we take the positive root:h = (1/3)[ -k + sqrt(10(k^2 +9)) ]This is a complicated expression. Let&#39;s attempt to find a value of k that makes the expression inside the square root a perfect square. Let me set sqrt(10(k^2 +9)) = m, then m must be an integer multiple or something. Alternatively, suppose that 10(k^2 +9)= (ak +b)^2 for some a and b. Let&#39;s see:Let’s assume 10(k^2 +9)= (ak +b)^2. Then,10k^2 +90= a^2k^2 +2abk +b^2Equating coefficients:a^2=10 =&gt; a=√102ab=0 =&gt; Either a=0 or b=0. But a=√10≠0, so b=0.Then, 10k^2 +90=10k^2 =&gt;90=0, which is impossible. Therefore, no such real numbers a and b exist. Therefore, this approach fails.Alternatively, maybe set k=1. Let&#39;s try k=1:h=(1/3)[ -1 + sqrt(10(1 +9)) ]= (1/3)[ -1 + sqrt(100) ]= (1/3)[ -1 +10 ]= (1/3)(9)=3But h=3, which is the previous case where the origin is on the circle. If we take k=1, h=3. But in this case, h=3 is not less than3, so it&#39;s the borderline case where the origin is on the circle.What if k=2:h=(1/3)[ -2 + sqrt(10(4 +9)) ]= (1/3)[ -2 + sqrt(130) ]≈ (1/3)[ -2 +11.401 ]≈ (1/3)(9.401)≈3.133. But h must be &lt;3, so this gives h≈3.133&gt;3, which is invalid.k=0.5:h=(1/3)[ -0.5 + sqrt(10(0.25 +9)) ]= (1/3)[ -0.5 + sqrt(10*9.25) ]= (1/3)[ -0.5 + sqrt(92.5) ]≈ (1/3)[ -0.5 +9.616 ]≈(1/3)(9.116)≈3.039&gt;3. Still invalid.k=1. Let&#39;s try k= sqrt( something). Wait, maybe we need a different approach. Let&#39;s consider that h is expressed in terms of k, but this seems too complicated. Perhaps the only valid solution is h=3, k=1, which is the case where the origin is on the circle. The other case leads to h&gt;3, which contradicts h&lt;3. Therefore, maybe the only possible solution is h=3, k=1. But when we derived that, we considered the case where the origin is on the circle. Therefore, the answer is (x -3)^2 + (y -1)^2=10.But to confirm, let&#39;s check if there are other solutions. Suppose we let k=3:h=(1/3)[ -3 + sqrt(10(9 +9)) ]= (1/3)[ -3 + sqrt(180) ]= (1/3)[ -3 + 6*sqrt(5) ]≈(1/3)(-3 +13.416)=≈(10.416)/3≈3.472&gt;3. Still invalid.Alternatively, k=0.1:h≈(1/3)[ -0.1 + sqrt(10(0.01 +9)) ]≈(1/3)[ -0.1 +sqrt(90.1) ]≈(1/3)[ -0.1 +9.49 ]≈(1/3)(9.39)≈3.13&gt;3.It seems that for any k&gt;0, h evaluates to greater than3, which is invalid in this scenario where h&lt;3. Therefore, the only valid solution is h=3, k=1. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x -3)^2 + (y -1)^2=10.Thus, the answer is boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}Final AnswerThe equation of circle ( M ) is boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that the center of circle ( M ) is in the first quadrant, the chord intercepted by the ( x )-axis through the origin ( O ) has a length of 6, and the circle is tangent to the line ( 3x + y = 0 ), we need to find the equation of circle ( M ).1. Chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin:   - The chord length is 6, implying the x-axis intersects the circle at two points 6 units apart. Since the origin lies on this chord, the points of intersection are ((-3, 0)) and ((3, 0)). However, since the center is in the first quadrant, the points of intersection must be ((0, 0)) and ((6, 0)), making the origin one endpoint of the chord.2. Equation of the circle:   - Let the center of the circle be ((h, k)). The radius ( r ) is the distance from the center to the origin, ( sqrt{h^2 + k^2} ).   - The circle passes through ((6, 0)), so the distance from ((h, k)) to ((6, 0)) is also ( r ):     [     sqrt{(h - 6)^2 + k^2} = sqrt{h^2 + k^2}     ]   - Solving this, we get ( h = 3 ).3. Tangent to the line ( 3x + y = 0 ):   - The distance from the center ((3, k)) to the line ( 3x + y = 0 ) must equal the radius ( sqrt{9 + k^2} ):     [     frac{|3 cdot 3 + k|}{sqrt{10}} = sqrt{9 + k^2}     ]   - Squaring both sides and solving, we find ( k = 1 ).4. Radius calculation:   - The radius ( r ) is ( sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{10} ).Thus, the equation of the circle is:[boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}],&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s see. I need to find the equation of circle M. The center is in the first quadrant. There&#39;s a chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin, and that chord has a length of 6. Also, the circle is tangent to the line 3x + y = 0. Hmm, that seems like a few conditions. Let me break them down one by one.First, the center of the circle is in the first quadrant. So if I denote the center as (h, k), then h &gt; 0 and k &gt; 0. The equation of the circle would be (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where r is the radius.Next, there&#39;s a chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. Wait, so the chord is on the x-axis, and it passes through the origin? That means the chord is part of the x-axis, right? But the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. So the circle intersects the x-axis at two points, forming a chord of length 6, and this chord passes through the origin. Hmm, so the x-axis is cutting the circle into a chord of length 6, and this chord goes through the origin. So the origin is a point on the x-axis, which is the line containing the chord. So the chord is along the x-axis, between two points, say, (a, 0) and (b, 0), and the distance between them is 6. But also, the chord passes through the origin, which is (0,0). Therefore, the origin must be somewhere on this chord. Since the chord is along the x-axis, the origin is one of the points on the chord. Wait, but if the chord is along the x-axis and passes through the origin, then one of the intersection points could be the origin. But then the chord would have length 6, so the other intersection point would be (6, 0) or (-6, 0). But if the center is in the first quadrant, then the circle might intersect the x-axis at two points, one of which is the origin, and the other is (6, 0), but since the center is in the first quadrant, maybe the other point is (6, 0). Wait, but let&#39;s think.Alternatively, maybe the chord is between two points on the x-axis, with length 6, and the line through the origin. Wait, the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. So the chord is along the x-axis, passing through the origin, with length 6. So the chord is from (-3, 0) to (3, 0), centered at the origin? Wait, but then the length would be 6. So maybe the chord is from (0,0) to (6,0), but that&#39;s length 6. Wait, but if the chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin, maybe that means the chord is the segment from (0,0) to some other point on the x-axis, but the length is 6. Wait, maybe the chord is between two points on the x-axis, such that it passes through the origin, and has a length of 6. So the chord is a line segment on the x-axis passing through the origin with length 6. That could be from (-3,0) to (3,0), right? That&#39;s a chord of length 6, centered at the origin. So the circle intersects the x-axis at (-3,0) and (3,0). But if the center is in the first quadrant, then the circle must pass through both (-3,0) and (3,0). Wait, but if the center is in the first quadrant, the circle would have to be symmetric in some way with respect to the x-axis? Wait, but if the circle passes through (-3,0) and (3,0), then the center lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining these two points. The perpendicular bisector of the segment from (-3,0) to (3,0) is the y-axis. But the center is in the first quadrant, so the center can&#39;t be on the y-axis. Therefore, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, maybe the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin is not necessarily symmetric about the origin. Let&#39;s think again. The chord is intercepted by the x-axis through the origin. So the chord is on the x-axis, passes through the origin, and has a length of 6. So the chord could be from (a, 0) to (b, 0) where the origin is between a and b, and the distance between a and b is 6. So if the origin is one endpoint, then the other endpoint is (6,0) or (-6,0). But if the center is in the first quadrant, then the circle is more likely to intersect the x-axis at (0,0) and (6,0). Let me check.Suppose the circle passes through the origin and (6,0). Then the chord from (0,0) to (6,0) has length 6. The center (h,k) is in the first quadrant. The distance from the center to the x-axis is k, which is the y-coordinate. The radius would then be sqrt(h^2 + k^2) because the circle passes through the origin. Wait, no. If the circle passes through (0,0), then (0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2, so h^2 + k^2 = r^2. Similarly, it passes through (6,0), so (6 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2. Therefore, (6 - h)^2 + k^2 = h^2 + k^2. Therefore, expanding (6 - h)^2: 36 - 12h + h^2 + k^2 = h^2 + k^2. Subtract h^2 + k^2 from both sides: 36 - 12h = 0. So 36 = 12h =&gt; h = 3. So the center is at (3, k). But since the center is in the first quadrant, k &gt; 0. So center is (3, k). So the radius is sqrt(3^2 + k^2) = sqrt(9 + k^2). Then, the circle is also tangent to the line 3x + y = 0. The distance from the center (3, k) to the line 3x + y = 0 must be equal to the radius. The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Here, the line is 3x + y = 0, so a = 3, b = 1, c = 0. So the distance is |3*3 + 1*k + 0| / sqrt(9 + 1) = |9 + k| / sqrt(10). This should equal the radius sqrt(9 + k^2). Therefore:|9 + k| / sqrt(10) = sqrt(9 + k^2)Since k is positive (center in first quadrant), 9 + k is positive, so absolute value can be removed:(9 + k) / sqrt(10) = sqrt(9 + k^2)Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:(9 + k)^2 / 10 = 9 + k^2Multiply both sides by 10:(81 + 18k + k^2) = 90 + 10k^2Bring all terms to one side:81 + 18k + k^2 - 90 - 10k^2 = 0Simplify:-9k^2 + 18k - 9 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:9k^2 - 18k + 9 = 0Divide by 9:k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0This factors as (k - 1)^2 = 0, so k = 1Therefore, the center is (3, 1), and the radius is sqrt(9 + 1) = sqrt(10). Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10.Wait, let me check if this satisfies all the conditions.First, center (3,1) is in the first quadrant. Good.Chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin: The circle passes through (0,0) and (6,0), which is a chord of length 6 on the x-axis passing through the origin. The distance between (0,0) and (6,0) is 6. So that&#39;s correct.Tangent to the line 3x + y = 0: The distance from (3,1) to this line is |3*3 + 1*1| / sqrt(10) = |9 + 1| / sqrt(10) = 10 / sqrt(10) = sqrt(10), which is equal to the radius. So yes, the circle is tangent to that line.Therefore, this seems to check out. So the equation is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10.But wait, hold on. Let me confirm that the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin is indeed 6. So if the circle passes through (0,0) and (6,0), that&#39;s two points on the x-axis, and the distance between them is 6, which is correct. However, the chord intercepted by the x-axis would be the segment between those two points, which is indeed length 6, passing through the origin. Wait, (0,0) is one endpoint and (6,0) is the other, so the chord is from (0,0) to (6,0). So that chord does pass through the origin as one of its endpoints, right? So the problem says &quot;the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin O has a length of 6.&quot; So intercepting a chord through the origin with length 6. So if the chord is from (0,0) to (6,0), that&#39;s a length of 6. But if the chord is passing through the origin, but not necessarily having the origin as an endpoint, that would be different. Wait, the wording is &quot;intercepted by the x-axis through the origin&quot;. Hmm. So maybe &quot;intercepted by the x-axis&quot; means the x-axis cuts the circle into a chord, and this chord passes through the origin. So the chord is the intersection of the circle with the x-axis, and this chord passes through the origin. So the chord is the set of points where the circle meets the x-axis, which must pass through the origin. So the chord is the intersection points of the circle and the x-axis, which is a chord of length 6, and this chord passes through the origin. So in that case, the chord could be from (a,0) to (b,0) such that the origin is between a and b, and the distance between a and b is 6. So the midpoint of the chord would be at ( (a + b)/2, 0 ), and the origin is on the chord. So either a or b is zero, or the origin is between a and b.Wait, if the origin is on the chord, which is the intersection of the circle and the x-axis, then the origin is a point on the circle. Therefore, the circle passes through the origin. Therefore, substituting (0,0) into the circle&#39;s equation gives h^2 + k^2 = r^2. So that&#39;s one equation.Additionally, the chord on the x-axis has length 6. The length of the chord intercepted by the x-axis can be found using the formula for the length of a chord: 2*sqrt(r^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from the center to the line (here, the x-axis). The distance from the center (h,k) to the x-axis is k. Therefore, the length of the chord is 2*sqrt(r^2 - k^2) = 6. So sqrt(r^2 - k^2) = 3, so r^2 - k^2 = 9, so r^2 = k^2 + 9. But we also have from the circle passing through the origin: h^2 + k^2 = r^2. Therefore, h^2 + k^2 = k^2 + 9 =&gt; h^2 = 9 =&gt; h = 3 or h = -3. But since the center is in the first quadrant, h = 3. So center is (3, k). Then, the circle is also tangent to the line 3x + y = 0. The distance from center (3, k) to this line is equal to the radius. So as before:Distance = |3*3 + 1*k| / sqrt(3^2 + 1^2) = |9 + k| / sqrt(10) = radius = sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = sqrt(9 + k^2)So |9 + k| / sqrt(10) = sqrt(9 + k^2)Which again gives (9 + k)^2 = 10(9 + k^2)Expanding:81 + 18k + k^2 = 90 + 10k^2Rearranging:0 = 9k^2 - 18k + 9 =&gt; 9(k^2 - 2k + 1) = 0 =&gt; (k - 1)^2 = 0 =&gt; k = 1.So same result: center (3,1), radius sqrt(10). So equation is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}.Final AnswerThe equation of circle ( M ) is boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}.&lt;/think&gt;Given that the center of circle ( M ) is in the first quadrant, the chord intercepted by the ( x )-axis through the origin ( O ) has a length of 6, and the circle is tangent to the line ( 3x + y = 0 ). We need to find the equation of circle ( M ).1. Center and Radius:   - Let the center of the circle be ((h, k)) where ( h &gt; 0 ) and ( k &gt; 0 ).   - The equation of the circle is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2).2. Chord through the Origin:   - The chord intercepted by the ( x )-axis through the origin has a length of 6. This implies the circle intersects the ( x )-axis at two points, forming a chord of length 6 passing through the origin.   - The distance from the center ((h, k)) to the ( x )-axis is ( k ). The length of the chord is given by ( 2sqrt{r^2 - k^2} = 6 ), leading to ( sqrt{r^2 - k^2} = 3 ) and ( r^2 = k^2 + 9 ).3. Circle Passing Through the Origin:   - Since the circle passes through the origin, substituting ((0, 0)) into the circle&#39;s equation gives ( h^2 + k^2 = r^2 ).   - Combining with ( r^2 = k^2 + 9 ), we get ( h^2 = 9 ) hence ( h = 3 ) (since ( h &gt; 0 )).4. Tangency Condition:   - The circle is tangent to the line ( 3x + y = 0 ). The distance from the center ((3, k)) to this line must equal the radius ( r ).   - The distance formula gives ( frac{|3 cdot 3 + k|}{sqrt{10}} = sqrt{9 + k^2} ).   - Simplifying, we find ( frac{|9 + k|}{sqrt{10}} = sqrt{9 + k^2} ). Squaring both sides and solving, we get ( k = 1 ).5. Equation of the Circle:   - With ( h = 3 ) and ( k = 1 ), the radius ( r = sqrt{9 + 1^2} = sqrt{10} ).   - The equation of the circle is ((x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10).Thus, the equation of circle ( M ) is (boxed{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 10}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>Since the center of circle M is in the first quadrant and the chord intercepted by the x-axis through the origin O has a length of 6, we can denote the center of the circle as (3, b).As the circle is tangent to the line 3x+y=0, the distance from the center of the circle to the line should be equal to the radius of the circle.

Let&#39;s start with part (a).First, the problem says that G(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients, and it takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃ &lt; x₄ &lt; x₅. Also, the graph of y = G(x) is symmetric with respect to the line x = -7. We need to find x₁ + x₃ + x₅ for part (a).Hmm, symmetry with respect to the vertical line x = -7. So, that means if (a, b) is a point on the graph, then the point (-14 - a, b) is also on the graph. Because reflecting over x = -7 would take a point at a distance d to the right of -7 to a point at distance d to the left of -7. So the reflection of x over x = -7 is -7 - (x - (-7)) = -14 - x. Wait, let me confirm that reflection formula.The reflection of a point x over the line x = c is 2c - x. Right, so if the line is x = -7, then reflection would be 2*(-7) - x = -14 - x. Yes, that makes sense. So for any x, the reflection over x = -7 is -14 - x.Therefore, if G(x) = 2022 at x = x₁, then it must also be 2022 at x = -14 - x₁. Similarly, for x₂, the reflection is -14 - x₂, and so on. So the roots of G(x) = 2022 (i.e., the solutions to G(x) - 2022 = 0) are symmetric around -7.But there are five roots, which is an odd number. So if we pair them up, except for the middle one. So x₃ must be the point that is its own reflection, right? Because when you have an odd number of symmetric points, the middle one is on the axis of symmetry. So x₃ = -14 - x₃ ⇒ 2x₃ = -14 ⇒ x₃ = -7. Wait, that&#39;s interesting. So the middle root x₃ is exactly at -7. That makes sense.Then the other roots are symmetric around -7. So x₁ and x₅ are reflections of each other, as are x₂ and x₄. So x₁ = -14 - x₅, and x₂ = -14 - x₄. So let&#39;s write that down:x₁ = -14 - x₅  x₂ = -14 - x₄  x₃ = -7Therefore, if we sum x₁ + x₃ + x₅, substituting x₁ from above:x₁ + x₅ = (-14 - x₅) + x₅ = -14  Then adding x₃ = -7: total sum is -14 + (-7) = -21.So the answer for part (a) is -21. Let me check that again. If x₁ and x₅ are symmetric around -7, their average is -7. So (x₁ + x₅)/2 = -7 ⇒ x₁ + x₅ = -14. Similarly, x₂ + x₄ = -14. Then x₃ is -7. So total sum x₁ + x₃ + x₅ = -14 + (-7) = -21. Yeah, that seems correct.Now part (b): What is the smallest degree that G(x) can have?So G(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients, symmetric about x = -7. The equation G(x) = 2022 has five real roots. To find the minimal degree possible for G(x).Since the graph is symmetric about x = -7, we can model G(x) as a polynomial that&#39;s symmetric about that line. So, perhaps a transformation of variables would help. Let&#39;s let t = x + 7, shifting the coordinate system so that the axis of symmetry is at t = 0. So the polynomial would be even in terms of t, right? Because symmetry about t = 0 (which corresponds to x = -7) implies that G(x) is an even function in terms of t. So G(x) = H(t), where t = x + 7, and H(t) is an even function.Therefore, H(t) = H(-t). So H is an even polynomial. Then, the original polynomial G(x) = H(x + 7), where H is even. Therefore, all the exponents in H must be even. So H(t) is a polynomial with only even powers of t, which implies that G(x) is a polynomial in (x + 7) with only even powers. Therefore, G(x) can be written as a polynomial of (x + 7)^2. For example, G(x) = a*(x + 7)^2n + b*(x + 7)^2(n-1) + ... + c.But since G(x) = 2022 has five real roots, then G(x) - 2022 = 0 has five roots. Since G(x) is symmetric about x = -7, as we saw, the roots come in pairs symmetric around -7, except for the middle root at x = -7.Therefore, G(x) - 2022 has a root at x = -7 (with multiplicity 1?), and two pairs of roots symmetric around -7. Wait, but five roots in total, so maybe the root at -7 is a single root, and the other four roots are two pairs. So G(x) - 2022 can be written as (x + 7) * [(x + 7)^2 - a] * [(x + 7)^2 - b], where a and b are positive real numbers, because the other roots are symmetric. Hmm, but if we have four roots from two quadratics, but since we need five roots, perhaps one of them is a single root at -7.Wait, but if G(x) - 2022 has five roots, and due to the symmetry, then if we write G(x) - 2022 = (x + 7) * Q((x + 7)^2), where Q is some polynomial. Then Q((x + 7)^2) must have two distinct positive roots (since (x + 7)^2 is always non-negative). So Q(y) is a quadratic in y, perhaps? Let&#39;s see.Suppose that G(x) - 2022 is a polynomial of degree 5. But since G(x) is symmetric about x = -7, G(x) must be a polynomial in (x + 7)^2, but with an odd degree? Wait, no. Wait, G(x) is symmetric about x = -7, so it must be an even function in terms of t = x + 7. So G(x) = H(t), H even. So H(t) must be an even function, which is a polynomial in t^2. Therefore, H(t) must be a polynomial of even degree. However, if we have G(x) - 2022 = H(t) - 2022. So H(t) - 2022 is a polynomial of even degree (since H is even), but it has five real roots. However, a polynomial of even degree can have an odd number of real roots? Wait, no. Wait, a polynomial of even degree must have even number of real roots (counting multiplicities), or possibly an odd number if some roots are complex. But in this case, all roots are real. Wait, but H(t) - 2022 is even degree, so it must have even number of real roots (counted with multiplicity). But the problem says exactly five different real roots. Wait, that&#39;s a contradiction. Because if H(t) is even, then H(t) - 2022 is even, so if t is a root, then -t is also a root. Therefore, the number of real roots must be even, unless t=0 is a root. But in our case, the equation G(x) = 2022 has five real roots. So t = x + 7, so x = t -7. Therefore, the roots in t would be t₁ = x₁ +7, t₂ = x₂ +7, ..., t₅ = x₅ +7. Since x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃ &lt; x₄ &lt; x₅, then t₁ &lt; t₂ &lt; t₃ &lt; t₄ &lt; t₅. But given the symmetry in x, the roots in t should be symmetric about t=0. Wait, no. Wait, the symmetry in x is about x=-7, which translates to t = 0. So if t is a root, then -t is also a root. So the roots in t are symmetric about 0. Therefore, except for t=0, all roots come in pairs. But we have five roots in t, which is odd. Therefore, one of the roots must be t=0, and the other four roots are two symmetric pairs. So the roots in t are: -a, -b, 0, b, a (assuming a and b are positive). Then, in terms of x, these are x = -7 -a, -7 -b, -7, -7 + b, -7 + a. So arranged in order: x₁ = -7 -a, x₂ = -7 -b, x₃ = -7, x₄ = -7 + b, x₅ = -7 + a. So given that x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃ &lt; x₄ &lt; x₅, we need -7 -a &lt; -7 -b &lt; -7 &lt; -7 + b &lt; -7 + a. Therefore, we must have a &gt; b &gt;0. So the roots are symmetric around t=0 (x=-7), and the polynomial H(t) - 2022 must have roots at t = -a, -b, 0, b, a. Therefore, H(t) - 2022 = t(t^2 - b²)(t² - a²). Since H(t) is an even function, but H(t) - 2022 is not even, unless 2022 is subtracted. Wait, but H(t) is even, so H(t) - 2022 is even minus a constant. Wait, but H(t) - 2022 = even function minus a constant. Therefore, it&#39;s not necessarily even. Wait, but how come the roots are symmetric? Because the original equation G(x) = 2022 is symmetric with respect to x=-7, so if x is a solution, then -14 -x is a solution. So translating to t, if t is a solution, then -t is a solution. Therefore, the roots in t are symmetric, so H(t) - 2022 has roots symmetric about t=0, but since there&#39;s an odd number of roots, one of them must be at t=0. Therefore, H(t) - 2022 must have a factor of t*(t² - c²)*(t² - d²). So, that is a fifth-degree polynomial. However, H(t) is even, so H(t) is a polynomial of even degree. Wait, but H(t) - 2022 would then have degree equal to the degree of H(t). If H(t) is even, then H(t) - 2022 is also even, but we just saw that H(t) - 2022 has roots that include t=0 and pairs ±c, ±d. But if H(t) is even, then H(t) - 2022 is even, so all roots must come in ± pairs. However, t=0 is a root of multiplicity 1, but 0 is its own mirror image, so if H(t) - 2022 has a root at t=0, then its multiplicity must be even, because H(t) - 2022 is even. Wait, but that&#39;s a contradiction. Because if H(t) - 2022 is even, then all odd-powered terms have coefficients zero. Therefore, if t=0 is a root, its multiplicity must be even. But the problem states that there are exactly five different real roots, which would require t=0 to be a simple root (multiplicity 1), which is impossible because H(t) - 2022 is even. Therefore, there&#39;s a problem here.Wait, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Let me re-examine.We know that G(x) is symmetric about x=-7, so G(x) = G(-14 - x). So for any x, G(x) = G(-14 - x). Therefore, the polynomial G(x) satisfies the identity G(x) = G(-14 -x). Therefore, if we let t = x +7, then x = t -7, so -14 -x = -14 - (t -7) = -14 - t +7 = -7 - t. Therefore, G(t -7) = G(-7 - t). Therefore, H(t) = G(t -7) must satisfy H(t) = H(-t), so H is even. Therefore, H(t) is an even function, so it only has even powers of t. Therefore, H(t) = a_0 + a_2 t² + a_4 t^4 + ... + a_{2n} t^{2n}. Therefore, G(x) = H(x +7) is a polynomial in (x +7) with only even powers, hence G(x) is a polynomial of even degree. However, the equation G(x) = 2022 has five real roots, which is odd. But if G(x) is an even function in t = x +7, then G(x) - 2022 is H(t) - 2022. Since H(t) is even, H(t) - 2022 is even. However, an even function cannot have an odd number of real roots unless zero is a root with odd multiplicity. But if t=0 is a root, then because the function is even, the multiplicity must be even. Therefore, H(t) - 2022 cannot have an odd number of real roots. But the problem states that there are exactly five different real roots. So that&#39;s a contradiction. Therefore, how is that possible?Wait, maybe the polynomial G(x) - 2022 is not even, but G(x) is even in terms of t = x +7. Wait, G(x) is even in t, so G(x) - 2022 = H(t) - 2022, which is even in t. Therefore, the equation H(t) = 2022 is even, so the roots in t must satisfy if t is a root, then -t is a root. But since there are five roots, which is odd, that would require t=0 to be a root. But t=0 corresponds to x = -7, so x=-7 is a root. Then, the other roots come in pairs ±t1, ±t2. So total roots would be 1 (from t=0) + 2 pairs = 5 roots. But t=0 is a root, so multiplicity? Wait, but if H(t) - 2022 is even, then if t=0 is a root, then the multiplicity must be even. However, the problem says exactly five different real roots. So multiplicity of t=0 is 1, but that&#39;s impossible because H(t) - 2022 is even, so t=0 must have even multiplicity. Therefore, there&#39;s a contradiction here.Wait, this suggests that the problem statement might have a mistake, but the problem says &quot;the polynomial G(x) with real coefficients takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points&quot;. So that must be possible. Therefore, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.Alternatively, maybe G(x) is a polynomial of odd degree, which is symmetric about x=-7. But if G(x) is symmetric about x=-7, then it must satisfy G(x) = G(-14 -x). So if G is a polynomial of degree n, then G(-14 -x) is also a polynomial of degree n. For these two to be equal for all x, the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions. Let&#39;s consider that.Suppose G(x) is a polynomial of degree n. Then G(-14 -x) is also a polynomial of degree n. For G(x) = G(-14 -x) to hold, the coefficients must satisfy the relation that comes from substituting x with -14 -x. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose G(x) is linear: G(x) = ax + b. Then G(-14 -x) = a*(-14 -x) + b = -14a -ax + b. For G(x) = G(-14 -x), we need ax + b = -14a -ax + b ⇒ 2ax +14a =0 for all x. Which implies a=0. So G(x) is constant. So only constant polynomials are symmetric about x=-7 in degree 1. Similarly, quadratic: G(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then G(-14 -x) = a*(-14 -x)^2 + b*(-14 -x) + c = a*(196 +28x +x²) + b*(-14 -x) + c = a x² + (28a -b)x + (196a -14b + c). For G(x) = G(-14 -x), coefficients must satisfy:a = a  28a - b = b  196a -14b + c = cFrom second equation: 28a -b = b ⇒ 28a = 2b ⇒ b =14a  From third equation: 196a -14b + c = c ⇒ 196a -14b =0 ⇒ 14a -b=0 ⇒ same as above. So quadratic polynomials symmetric about x=-7 are of the form a x² +14a x + c. Which can be written as a(x² +14x) +c. Completing the square: x² +14x = (x +7)^2 -49. So G(x) = a[(x +7)^2 -49] +c = a(x +7)^2 -49a +c. So any quadratic symmetric about x=-7 is a parabola with vertex at x=-7. So in that case, G(x) = A(x +7)^2 + B.Similarly, for higher degrees. So for a polynomial of degree n to be symmetric about x=-7, it must satisfy G(x) = G(-14 -x). Let&#39;s think about what kind of polynomials satisfy this.Let me make a substitution t = x +7, so x = t -7. Then G(x) = G(t -7) = G(-14 - (t -7)) = G(-14 - t +7) = G(-7 - t). So G(t -7) = G(-7 - t). Let H(t) = G(t -7). Then H(t) = H(-t). Therefore, H(t) is an even function, so all the odd-powered coefficients must be zero. Therefore, H(t) is a polynomial with only even powers of t, so H(t) = a_0 + a_2 t² + a_4 t^4 + ... + a_{2m} t^{2m}. Therefore, G(x) = H(x +7) = a_0 + a_2 (x +7)^2 + a_4 (x +7)^4 + ... + a_{2m} (x +7)^{2m}. Therefore, G(x) is a polynomial in (x +7)^2. Therefore, G(x) must be an even function in t = x +7, so it&#39;s a polynomial of even degree. Therefore, the degree of G(x) is 2m. But the problem says that G(x) is a polynomial with real coefficients that takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points. So if G(x) -2022 has five real roots, and G(x) is a polynomial of even degree, then the minimal degree would be such that G(x) -2022 can have five real roots. But since G(x) is a polynomial in (x +7)^2, then G(x) -2022 is a polynomial in (x +7)^2 minus 2022. So suppose G(x) is of degree 2m. Then G(x) -2022 is also degree 2m. The equation G(x) -2022 =0 would then be equivalent to H(t) -2022 =0, where H(t) is a polynomial of degree m in t². Wait, no, if H(t) is a polynomial of degree 2m, then H(t) -2022 is also degree 2m. However, since H(t) is even, the equation H(t) =2022 is equivalent to a polynomial equation in t². Let me write H(t) = P(t²), where P is a polynomial. Then H(t) =2022 becomes P(t²) =2022. Let y = t², then P(y) =2022. Each positive root y corresponds to two real roots t = ±√y, and a root at y=0 corresponds to t=0. But in our case, the equation G(x) =2022 has five real roots, which correspond to five values of t (since x = t -7). Therefore, since H(t) =2022 has five real roots in t, which are symmetric about t=0, and given that H(t) is even, these roots must be t =0 and ±t1, ±t2. However, t=0 is a single root (x =-7) but if H(t) -2022 has a root at t=0, then since H(t) is even, the multiplicity must be even. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, unless the root at t=0 has even multiplicity, but the problem states exactly five different points, so all roots are simple. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for H(t) -2022 to have an odd number of real roots because H(t) -2022 is even. Therefore, there&#39;s a problem here. But the problem says that there are five real roots. So maybe the minimal degree is higher.Wait, maybe the polynomial G(x) is of even degree, but G(x) -2022 is not even, but G(x) is even in t. Wait, no. Wait, G(x) is even in t, so G(x) -2022 is H(t) -2022, which is even in t. Therefore, H(t) -2022 is even, so roots come in pairs. If H(t) -2022 has a root at t=0, it must have even multiplicity, but the problem states five distinct roots, which would require t=0 to be a root of multiplicity 1, which is impossible. Therefore, how can we reconcile this?Wait, maybe the axis of symmetry is not about t=0 but some other line. Wait, no, we did the substitution correctly. The symmetry about x=-7 translates to t = x +7, so symmetry about t=0. Therefore, H(t) is even, so H(t) -2022 is even. Then H(t) -2022 can&#39;t have an odd number of real roots. But the problem says it does. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the only way this is possible is if H(t) -2022 is not even, but that&#39;s not possible because H(t) is even. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.Alternatively, maybe the polynomial G(x) is not of even degree. Wait, but H(t) is even, so it&#39;s a polynomial with only even powers, so H(t) is of even degree, hence G(x) = H(t) is also of even degree because t = x +7 is linear. So if H(t) is degree 2m, then G(x) is also degree 2m. So the minimal degree must be even. But the equation G(x) =2022 has five real roots. So if G(x) is a quadratic (degree 2), then G(x) -2022 is quadratic, which can have at most 2 roots. So quadratic is too low. If G(x) is quartic (degree 4), then G(x) -2022 is quartic. A quartic can have up to four real roots. But we need five. So quartic is insufficient. Therefore, degree 6. A sixth-degree polynomial can have up to six real roots. But since the equation is H(t) =2022, which is even, it&#39;s equivalent to a cubic in y = t². So H(t) = P(t²), so equation P(y) =2022. The number of real roots corresponds to the number of positive roots of P(y) =2022. Each positive root y gives two real roots t=±√y. If we need five real roots in t, that would require two positive roots (each giving two t roots) and one root at y=0 (giving t=0). But H(t) -2022 = P(t²) -2022. If y=0 is a root, then P(0) =2022. Then, if P(y) -2022 has two distinct positive roots y1 and y2, then t would have roots at ±√y1, ±√y2, and 0. But 0 would come from y=0, which is P(0)=2022. Wait, but if y=0 is a root of P(y) -2022, then P(0)=2022. But in that case, t=0 is a root of H(t) -2022, but since H(t) is even, multiplicity of t=0 is even. So if t=0 is a root, then it must have even multiplicity. Therefore, if H(t) -2022 has a root at t=0, it must have even multiplicity, which would mean that y=0 is a root of P(y) -2022 with even multiplicity, but if we need five distinct roots, then t=0 can&#39;t be a root. Therefore, maybe all roots are non-zero. But then, since they come in pairs, the number of roots must be even. So to have five roots, impossible. Therefore, there must be a contradiction unless we have a root at t=0 with multiplicity one, which is impossible.Wait, this seems like a paradox. The problem states that such a polynomial exists with five real roots, but according to the symmetry, it&#39;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the minimal degree is 5. But wait, but G(x) is symmetric about x=-7, so it&#39;s an even function in t =x +7, which requires it to have even degree. So degree 5 is impossible.Alternatively, maybe the polynomial is of odd degree, but then how is it symmetric about x=-7?Wait, suppose G(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial. Let&#39;s see if it can be symmetric about x=-7. Let&#39;s try to construct such a polynomial.Suppose G(x) is symmetric about x=-7, so G(x) = G(-14 -x). Let&#39;s check what this implies for the coefficients. Let G(x) = a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + ... +a_0. Then G(-14 -x) = a_5 (-14 -x)^5 + a_4 (-14 -x)^4 + ... +a0. For G(x) = G(-14 -x), the coefficients must satisfy:a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + ... +a0 = a_5 (-14 -x)^5 + a_4 (-14 -x)^4 + ... +a0.Subtracting a0 from both sides:a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + ... +a1 x = a_5 (-14 -x)^5 + a_4 (-14 -x)^4 + ... +a1 (-14 -x).But for these two polynomials to be equal for all x, all coefficients must match. Let&#39;s consider the leading term. On the left, the leading term is a_5 x^5. On the right, expanding (-14 -x)^5, the leading term is (-x)^5 = -x^5. Therefore, the leading term on the right is a_5 (-x)^5 = -a_5 x^5. Therefore, equating coefficients:a_5 x^5 = -a_5 x^5 ⇒ a_5 = -a_5 ⇒ a_5 =0. So the fifth-degree term must be zero. Contradiction. Therefore, there is no non-zero fifth-degree polynomial that satisfies G(x) = G(-14 -x). Therefore, G(x) cannot be of odd degree. So the minimal degree must be even.But earlier, we saw that even degree polynomials symmetric about x=-7 can&#39;t have an odd number of real roots for G(x) =2022. But the problem says there are five. Therefore, there must be some mistake here.Wait, perhaps the key is that the equation G(x) =2022 has five distinct real roots, but the polynomial H(t) -2022 must have even degree, say 2m, but with some multiple roots. Wait, but the problem states exactly five different points, so all roots are simple. Therefore, multiplicity one. But H(t) -2022 is even, so roots come in pairs. Unless t=0 is a root, but then multiplicity must be even. Therefore, impossible. So perhaps the answer is that it&#39;s impossible, but the problem says &quot;the polynomial G(x) with real coefficients takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points&quot;. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.Wait, maybe the symmetry is about the line x=-7, but the polynomial is not necessarily even in t =x +7. Wait, no, the symmetry about x=-7 implies that G(x) = G(-14 -x). So substituting x with -14 -x leaves G(x) unchanged. Therefore, the polynomial must satisfy G(x) = G(-14 -x). Which, as before, implies that in terms of t =x +7, it&#39;s even. Therefore, H(t) = G(t -7) is even.Wait, let me take a specific example. Let&#39;s suppose G(x) is a quadratic polynomial symmetric about x=-7, which would have the form G(x) = a(x +7)^2 + k. Then G(x) =2022 would be a(x +7)^2 +k =2022 ⇒ (x +7)^2 = (2022 -k)/a. So this equation has two real roots if (2022 -k)/a &gt;0, which are symmetric around x=-7. But the problem needs five roots, so quadratic is insufficient.If G(x) is quartic: G(x) = a(x +7)^4 + b(x +7)^2 + c. Then G(x) =2022 becomes a(x +7)^4 + b(x +7)^2 + (c -2022)=0. Let y = (x +7)^2, then the equation becomes a y² +b y + (c -2022)=0. This quadratic in y can have two positive roots, each giving two real roots in x, so total four roots. Or one positive root and one zero root, but zero root would correspond to x=-7, but with multiplicity two. However, the problem states five distinct roots, so quartic can have maximum four distinct roots. Therefore, quartic is insufficient.Then degree six: G(x) = a(x +7)^6 + b(x +7)^4 + c(x +7)^2 + d. Then G(x) =2022 becomes a(x +7)^6 + b(x +7)^4 + c(x +7)^2 + (d -2022)=0. Let y = (x +7)^2, then equation becomes a y³ +b y² +c y + (d -2022)=0. This is a cubic in y. A cubic can have one or three real roots. If it has three real roots, and assuming all are positive, then each y root gives two x roots, so total six x roots. If one y root is zero (but then x=-7, multiplicity two), but since we need five distinct roots, maybe one of the y roots is zero (but then d -2022=0). Wait, but if y=0 is a root, then equation becomes 0 +0 +0 + (d -2022)=0 ⇒ d=2022. So the equation becomes a y³ +b y² +c y =0 ⇒ y(a y² +b y +c)=0. So roots at y=0 and roots of a y² +b y +c=0. If the quadratic has two positive roots, then total roots in y: 0, y1, y2. Then in x: for y=0, x=-7 (double root). For y1 and y2, each gives two roots. So total roots in x: 2 (from y=0 with multiplicity 2) + 2 + 2 =6. But the problem says exactly five different real roots. Therefore, perhaps one of the roots y has multiplicity 1 but y=0 is a simple root? But then, since y=0 is a root of multiplicity 1, but in terms of x, this would give x=-7 with multiplicity 1. However, the equation G(x) =2022 would then have roots at x=-7 (from y=0) and two pairs from y1 and y2. But if y=0 is a simple root, then the cubic equation in y has three simple roots: 0, y1, y2. Then x=-7 once, and ±√y1, ±√y2. Therefore, five distinct roots: x=-7, -7 ±√y1, -7 ±√y2. Wait, but that&#39;s five roots if y1 and y2 are distinct positive numbers. Wait, no: if y1 and y2 are distinct and positive, then each gives two roots, so x=-7 ±√y1 and x=-7 ±√y2. So that&#39;s four roots, plus x=-7. Total five roots. Oh! So in this case, if the cubic equation in y has three distinct real roots: 0, y1, y2 (with y1, y2 &gt;0), then the equation G(x)=2022 has five distinct real roots: x=-7 (once), x=-7 ±√y1, and x=-7 ±√y2. So that works. Therefore, a sixth-degree polynomial can have five distinct real roots in this scenario. But why does this work? Because when we set y=0, which gives x=-7, and then the other roots come in pairs. However, the polynomial H(t) -2022 = a t^6 +b t^4 +c t² +d -2022. Wait, but when we let t =x +7, so H(t) = G(x). So H(t) -2022 = a t^6 +b t^4 +c t² + (d -2022). This is an even function, so H(t) -2022 is even. Therefore, roots come in pairs ±t. However, in our case, the roots are t=0, and t=±√y1, ±√y2. But y1 and y2 are positive, so √y1 and √y2 are real. Therefore, the roots in t are 0, ±√y1, ±√y2. So five roots in total. But H(t) -2022 is a sixth-degree polynomial, so it can have six roots. But in this case, how does that reconcile with five roots? Wait, no. If the cubic equation in y has three roots: 0, y1, y2, then each y corresponds to two t&#39;s except y=0. So in terms of t, the roots are t=0 (from y=0), t=±√y1, and t=±√y2. So total six roots: 0, √y1, -√y1, √y2, -√y2. But the problem states exactly five different real roots x₁ &lt;x₂ &lt;x₃ &lt;x₄ &lt;x₅. So x=-7 -√y2, x=-7 -√y1, x=-7, x=-7 +√y1, x=-7 +√y2. So ordered correctly. So five distinct real roots. Therefore, the sixth-degree polynomial can have five distinct real roots if the cubic in y has three real roots, one of which is zero (but multiplicity one), and the other two are positive and distinct. However, in the equation H(t) -2022 =0, which is equivalent to a sixth-degree polynomial equation, we have six roots: t=0, ±√y1, ±√y2. But x= t -7, so x=-7 (from t=0), x=-7 ±√y1, x=-7 ±√y2. So five distinct x&#39;s. Wait, no. If t=0 gives x=-7, t=√y1 gives x=-7 +√y1, t=-√y1 gives x=-7 -√y1, same for √y2. Therefore, total five different x&#39;s? Wait, no. Each t root gives a unique x. If t=0 gives x=-7. t=√y1 gives x=-7 +√y1, t=-√y1 gives x=-7 -√y1, similarly for √y2. So total five different x&#39;s if y1 ≠ y2 and both positive. Wait, no. If y1 and y2 are distinct positive numbers, then √y1 and √y2 are distinct positive numbers. Therefore, x=-7 -√y2, x=-7 -√y1, x=-7, x=-7 +√y1, x=-7 +√y2. So five distinct x&#39;s. But in terms of t, these correspond to six roots: 0, ±√y1, ±√y2. Wait, no. Because each x corresponds to a unique t, but t=√y1 and t=-√y1 correspond to x=-7 +√y1 and x=-7 -√y1. So the five distinct x&#39;s come from six t&#39;s? No, each x is unique. For example, t=√y1 gives x=-7 +√y1, and t=-√y1 gives x=-7 -√y1. These are two distinct x&#39;s. Similarly for t=√y2 and t=-√y2. Then t=0 gives x=-7. So in total, 1 + 2 + 2 =5 x&#39;s. But in terms of t, there are six roots: 0, ±√y1, ±√y2. So the equation H(t) -2022=0 has six roots, but when converted back to x, two of the t roots map to the same x? Wait, no. Each t root is unique. Wait, no. Each t is unique. For example, t=√y1 and t=-√y1 are different t&#39;s, which map to different x&#39;s. Wait, x = t -7, so t=√y1 corresponds to x=√y1 -7, and t=-√y1 corresponds to x=-√y1 -7. These are two different x&#39;s. Therefore, six distinct t roots correspond to six distinct x roots. But the problem states five. Therefore, contradiction.Wait, this is confusing. The problem says that the polynomial G(x) takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points. So G(x) -2022 has five distinct real roots. But according to the symmetry, if G(x) is symmetric about x=-7, then G(x) -2022 must have roots that come in pairs symmetric about x=-7. If there&#39;s an odd number of roots, then the middle root must be at x=-7. So x=-7 is a root. Then the other four roots are two pairs symmetric around x=-7. Therefore, total roots: five. But in terms of t, this translates to roots at t=0, t= a, t=-a, t=b, t=-b. Wait, but that&#39;s five t roots: 0, a, -a, b, -b. Which would correspond to six x roots: x=-7, x=-7 ±a, x=-7 ±b. Unless a or b is zero. But if a or b is zero, then multiplicity. But the problem states five different points. So if, for example, a=0, then t=0 would correspond to x=-7, but then multiplicity. But the problem says exactly five different points, so all roots are simple. Therefore, a and b must be non-zero and distinct. Therefore, the equation H(t) -2022=0 must have five distinct roots: 0, a, -a, b, -b. But H(t) is even, so H(t) -2022 is even. Therefore, if t is a root, then -t is a root. So the number of roots must be even, except for t=0, which is its own negative. But if t=0 is a root, then it must have even multiplicity. However, the problem states that all roots are simple (exactly five different points). Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible for H(t) -2022=0 to have five distinct roots with t=0 being a simple root. Therefore, the initial assumption must be wrong. Therefore, the problem is contradictory. But the problem is given, so my reasoning must be wrong.Wait, perhaps the polynomial G(x) is not required to be symmetric as a whole, but the graph is symmetric. But how can the graph be symmetric without the polynomial being symmetric? For example, maybe it&#39;s a sum of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, but the graph symmetry implies that for every x, G(x) = G(-14 -x). Therefore, the polynomial must satisfy G(x) = G(-14 -x). Therefore, the polynomial is symmetric about x=-7.Alternatively, maybe the polynomial is of odd degree but with certain coefficients. But earlier we saw that for G(x) = G(-14 -x) to hold, all odd-degree coefficients must be zero. Wait, let&#39;s check.Suppose G(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial: G(x) = a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0. Then G(-14 -x) = a_5 (-14 -x)^5 + a_4 (-14 -x)^4 + a_3 (-14 -x)^3 + a_2 (-14 -x)^2 + a_1 (-14 -x) + a_0. For G(x) = G(-14 -x) for all x, the coefficients of corresponding powers must be equal. Let&#39;s compute the coefficients:Expand (-14 -x)^k using binomial theorem.For example, (-14 -x)^5 = - (x +14)^5 = -x^5 - 70x^4 - 3920x^3 - ... (the coefficients would be complicated, but the leading term is -x^5). Similarly, (-14 -x)^4 = (x +14)^4 = x^4 + 56x^3 + ... So:G(-14 -x) = a_5*(-x^5 -70x^4 - ... ) + a_4*(x^4 +56x^3 + ... ) + a_3*(-x^3 -42x^2 - ... ) + a_2*(x^2 +28x + ... ) + a_1*(-x -14) + a_0.Comparing coefficients with G(x) = a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0.For x^5 term: a_5 = -a_5 ⇒ a_5=0.Similarly, x^4 term: a_4 = -70a_5 + a_4. But a_5=0, so a_4 =a_4 ⇒ okay.x^3 term: a_3 = ... whatever. But since a_5=0, the x^3 term comes from a_4 and a_3:From G(-14 -x): coefficient of x^3 is a_4* (coefficient of x^3 in (-14 -x)^4) + a_3*(coefficient of x^3 in (-14 -x)^3).But (-14 -x)^4 = x^4 +56x^3 + ... , so coefficient of x^3 is 56. Similarly, (-14 -x)^3 = - (x +14)^3 = -x^3 -42x^2 -588x -2744, so coefficient of x^3 is -1.Therefore, coefficient of x^3 in G(-14 -x) is a_4*56 + a_3*(-1).In G(x), coefficient of x^3 is a_3. Therefore:a_3 =56a_4 -a_3 ⇒ 2a_3 =56a_4 ⇒a_3 =28a_4.Similarly, x^2 term: coefficient in G(-14 -x) is a_4*(coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^4) + a_3*(coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^3) + a_2*(coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^2).Let&#39;s compute:Coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^4: expanding (x +14)^4, coefficient of x^2 is C(4,2)*14² =6*196=1176.Coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^3: expanding -(x +14)^3, coefficient of x^2 is -C(3,2)*14 = -3*14= -42.Coefficient of x^2 in (-14 -x)^2: (x +14)^2 =x² +28x +196, so coefficient of x² is1.Therefore, coefficient of x^2 in G(-14 -x) is a_4*1176 + a_3*(-42) + a_2*1.In G(x), coefficient of x^2 is a_2. Therefore:a_2 =1176a_4 -42a_3 +a_2 ⇒ 0=1176a_4 -42a_3.But we know a_3=28a_4, so substitute:0=1176a_4 -42*(28a_4)=1176a_4 -1176a_4=0. So okay.Similarly, x term:Coefficient of x in G(-14 -x) comes from a_4 term, a_3 term, a_2 term, and a_1 term.But this is getting complicated. However, the key point is that by requiring G(x) = G(-14 -x), we end up with a system of equations that force all the odd-degree coefficients to be zero. For example, we saw that a_5=0. Similarly, if we consider the x term:Coefficient of x in G(-14 -x) is a_4*(coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^4) + a_3*(coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^3) + a_2*(coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^2) + a_1*(-1).Coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^4: expanding (x +14)^4, coefficient of x is C(4,1)*14³ =4*2744=10976.Coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^3: expanding -(x +14)^3, coefficient of x is -3*14²= -588.Coefficient of x in (-14 -x)^2: expanding (x +14)^2, coefficient of x is28.Therefore, coefficient of x in G(-14 -x) is a_4*10976 + a_3*(-588) + a_2*28 +a_1*(-1).In G(x), coefficient of x is a_1. So:a_1 =10976a_4 -588a_3 +28a_2 -a_1 ⇒ 2a_1 =10976a_4 -588a_3 +28a_2.But since a_3=28a_4 and a_2=1176a_4 -42a_3 +a_2⇒ already determined, this seems complex. However, substituting a_3=28a_4 and a_2=... wait, earlier when we had the x^2 term, we had a_2 =1176a_4 -42a_3 +a_2 ⇒0=1176a_4 -42a_3 ⇒1176a_4=42a_3=42*28a_4=1176a_4 ⇒0=0. So no new information. Therefore, let&#39;s substitute a_3=28a_4 into the equation for x term:2a_1=10976a_4 -588*(28a_4) +28a_2.Calculate:10976a_4 -588*28a_4=10976a_4 -16464a_4= -5488a_4.Then, +28a_2. But we don&#39;t have an expression for a_2 in terms of a_4. Wait, but from x^2 term, we have 0=1176a_4 -42a_3 ⇒1176a_4=42*28a_4=1176a_4, so no constraint. So a_2 is still arbitrary?Wait, this is getting too complicated. The key takeaway is that for G(x) to be symmetric about x=-7, it must satisfy G(x) = G(-14 -x), which forces the polynomial to have only even degrees when shifted by x=-7. Therefore, the minimal degree is even, and the equation G(x)=2022 can only have an even number of roots unless there is a root at x=-7. But in that case, the root at x=-7 must have even multiplicity. However, the problem states five distinct roots, which would require a root at x=-7 with multiplicity one, which is impossible. Therefore, the minimal degree must be six, allowing for six roots, but the problem says five. Therefore, perhaps the answer is six, assuming that one root is a double root that&#39;s counted once? No, the problem states exactly five different points. Therefore, the minimal degree must be six, because a quartic cannot have five roots, and a quadratic cannot. So sixth degree is the minimal possible.Therefore, answer for part (b) is 6.But let me check again. If G(x) is sixth-degree, symmetric about x=-7, then G(x) -2022 is sixth-degree. The equation G(x)=2022 has five distinct real roots. But according to the symmetry, there must be six roots (pairs and zero), but the problem says five. However, as we saw earlier, in terms of x, if we have roots at x=-7 (once), x=-7 ±a, x=-7 ±b, but these are five distinct x&#39;s. However, in terms of t, these correspond to six roots: 0, ±a, ±b. But the polynomial H(t) -2022 is sixth-degree, so it can have six roots. But in x, since t= x +7, each t corresponds to a unique x. Therefore, six roots in t correspond to six roots in x. But the problem states five. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the minimal degree is six, but the problem statement might have a mistake. Or perhaps I&#39;m missing something.Wait, no. If the polynomial G(x) is of sixth degree, and it&#39;s symmetric about x=-7, then G(x) -2022 =0 has roots at x=-7, x=-7 ±a, x=-7 ±b. But if a=0 or b=0, then x=-7 would be a multiple root. But the problem states exactly five different points. So if, for example, a=0, then x=-7 is a double root, and the other roots are x=-7 ±b. But then total roots are x=-7 (double), x=-7 +b, x=-7 -b. So four distinct roots. Not five. Similarly, if both a and b are zero, but that&#39;s not possible.Alternatively, if one pair of roots merges into x=-7. Wait, suppose the equation G(x)=2022 has a root at x=-7 with multiplicity one and two pairs of roots. But as we saw, the polynomial H(t) -2022 must have even degree and even number of roots unless t=0 is a root with even multiplicity. Therefore, it&#39;s impossible.Therefore, the conclusion is that the minimal degree is six, allowing for six roots, but the problem says five. Therefore, the answer must be six, because quartic cannot have five roots, and lower degrees cannot. The contradiction arises due to the symmetry requiring even number of roots, but the problem states five, which is possible only if there&#39;s a root at x=-7 with odd multiplicity, which is impossible. Therefore, the minimal degree is six, accepting that in reality, there must be six roots, but the problem mentions five, so possibly a misinterpretation.But according to the problem, it&#39;s given that there are exactly five different real roots. Therefore, the polynomial must be of even degree, but with five roots, which is possible only if one of the roots is of odd multiplicity. But for H(t) -2022 being even, this is impossible. Therefore, the minimal degree must be six, with the equation having six roots, but due to symmetry, two of them coincide at x=-7. But the problem states five different points, so multiplicity one at x=-7. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the answer must be six, accepting the contradiction, because the next possible even degree is six. Therefore, the minimal degree is six.Final Answer(a) boxed{-21}(b) boxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Given the polynomial ( G(x) ) with real coefficients that takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points ( x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; x_3 &lt; x_4 &lt; x_5 ), and knowing that the graph of ( y = G(x) ) is symmetric with respect to the line ( x = -7 ):(a) To find ( x_1 + x_3 + x_5 ):- The polynomial ( G(x) ) is symmetric about ( x = -7 ), meaning if ( x ) is a root of ( G(x) - 2022 ), then ( -14 - x ) is also a root.- The roots ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 ) are symmetric around ( x = -7 ). The middle root ( x_3 ) must be ( -7 ).- The other roots come in pairs: ( x_1 ) and ( x_5 ) are symmetric, as are ( x_2 ) and ( x_4 ). Therefore, ( x_1 + x_5 = -14 ) and ( x_2 + x_4 = -14 ).- Summing these, we get ( x_1 + x_3 + x_5 = -14 + (-7) = -21 ).(b) To find the smallest degree that ( G(x) ) can have:- The polynomial ( G(x) ) is symmetric about ( x = -7 ), implying it can be written as a polynomial in ( (x + 7)^2 ), which is an even function.- The equation ( G(x) = 2022 ) has five distinct roots, which must be symmetric around ( x = -7 ). This requires a polynomial of even degree.- A quartic polynomial (degree 4) can have at most four real roots, which is insufficient. A sixth-degree polynomial can have up to six real roots, but due to symmetry, it can have five distinct roots with one pair of roots coinciding at ( x = -7 ).Thus, the answers are:(a) (boxed{-21})(b) (boxed{6}),&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s tackle this problem step by step. The polynomial G(x) has real coefficients and is symmetric about the line x = -7. Also, it takes the value 2022 at exactly five distinct points x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃ &lt; x₄ &lt; x₅. Starting with part (a): Find x₁ + x₃ + x₅. Since the graph is symmetric about x = -7, that means if (a, b) is a point on the graph, then (-14 - a, b) is also on the graph. Wait, why? Because the line of symmetry x = -7 implies that for any point (x, y), its mirror image across x = -7 is (2*(-7) - x, y) = (-14 - x, y). So, if x is a root of G(x) = 2022, then -14 - x must also be a root. Therefore, the roots of G(x) = 2022 come in pairs symmetric around -7. But there are five roots, which is an odd number. That suggests one of the roots is exactly at the axis of symmetry, which is x = -7. Because if you have an odd number of roots, the middle one has to be its own mirror image. So, the five roots would be x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅, with x₃ = -7. Then x₁ and x₅ are symmetric around -7, as are x₂ and x₄. Therefore, x₁ + x₅ = 2*(-7) = -14, and x₂ + x₄ = 2*(-7) = -14. Then, x₁ + x₃ + x₅ = (x₁ + x₅) + x₃ = (-14) + (-7) = -21. So, the answer to part (a) is -21. Now part (b): What&#39;s the smallest degree that G(x) can have?Since G(x) is symmetric about x = -7, we can make a substitution to simplify things. Let’s let t = x + 7, so that the axis of symmetry becomes t = 0 (the y-axis). Then, the polynomial can be written as a function of t², because symmetry about the y-axis means it&#39;s an even function. So, G(x) = H(t²), where t = x + 7, and H is some polynomial. But G(x) is a polynomial in x, so substituting t = x + 7, we have G(x) = H((x + 7)^2). H must be a polynomial such that H((x + 7)^2) is a polynomial in x. Now, the equation G(x) = 2022 becomes H((x + 7)^2) = 2022. Let’s denote z = (x + 7)^2. Then H(z) = 2022. The solutions to this equation correspond to the roots z where H(z) = 2022. Each positive solution for z will give two real solutions for x: x = -7 ± √z. If z = 0, it gives one solution x = -7. But in our problem, G(x) = 2022 has five distinct real roots. Therefore, H(z) = 2022 must have three distinct real roots in z: one at z = 0 (since x = -7 is the middle root) and two positive roots (each giving two roots for x). Wait, but hold on. If z is (x + 7)^2, then each positive z gives two x&#39;s. However, the problem states there are exactly five different x&#39;s where G(x) = 2022. That suggests that H(z) = 2022 has three real roots in z: one at z = 0 (which would correspond to x = -7) and two positive roots, each of which would correspond to two x-values. So, 1 (from z=0) + 2*2 (from two positive z&#39;s) = 5 roots. But wait, if H(z) is a polynomial, then the equation H(z) = 2022 must have three real roots. Since H(z) is a polynomial, the equation H(z) - 2022 = 0 has three real roots. The minimal degree for H(z) would be 3, but since H(z) must be a polynomial such that G(x) = H((x + 7)^2) is also a polynomial. But H(z) needs to have three distinct real roots for H(z) = 2022. So, if H(z) is of degree 3, then H(z) - 2022 is a cubic with three real roots. However, a cubic can have three real roots, but depending on the multiplicities. However, since the roots z must be distinct (since the x&#39;s are distinct). Wait, the problem says that G(x) takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points. So, each z root must be distinct? Wait, if H(z) = 2022 has three distinct roots in z: one at 0 and two positive ones. Because if z is repeated, then (x + 7)^2 = z would lead to multiple x&#39;s. But since the problem states exactly five different x&#39;s, each z must be distinct, and each positive z must be distinct so that the x&#39;s are distinct. Therefore, H(z) - 2022 must have three distinct real roots: one at z = 0, and two positive z&#39;s. So, H(z) - 2022 is a cubic polynomial with roots at z = 0, z = a, z = b where a and b are positive and distinct. Therefore, H(z) is a cubic polynomial. Therefore, G(x) = H((x + 7)^2) would be a polynomial of degree 2*3 = 6. Wait, because if H(z) is a cubic, then H((x + 7)^2) is a polynomial in (x + 7)^2 of degree 3, so each term is like (x + 7)^6, (x + 7)^4, etc., so the highest degree term is 6. Hence, G(x) is a degree 6 polynomial. But is that the minimal degree? Let&#39;s see. Alternatively, maybe H(z) can be a quadratic? If H(z) is quadratic, then H(z) - 2022 is quadratic. A quadratic can have at most two real roots. But we need three roots. So H(z) must be at least cubic. Therefore, H(z) is cubic, leading to G(x) being degree 6. So the minimal degree is 6. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose H(z) is a cubic. Then H(z) - 2022 is a cubic equation. A cubic equation can have up to three real roots. So, if we set up H(z) such that H(z) - 2022 has exactly three real roots: one at z=0 and two positive. Then yes, that would work. So H(z) is a cubic, so G(x) is degree 6. But is there a way to have H(z) being a quadratic but still get three roots? For example, if H(z) is quadratic but with a double root. Wait, but H(z) - 2022 = 0 would have two roots. If one of them is a double root, say z = a (double root), then (x + 7)^2 = a would give two roots for x. But if z = a is a double root, does that mean multiplicities? But the problem states that the polynomial G(x) takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points, so all roots must be simple. So multiplicity 1. Therefore, H(z) - 2022 must have three distinct roots. Thus, H(z) must be at least degree 3. Hence, G(x) must be degree 6. Therefore, the minimal degree is 6. But wait, let&#39;s verify this. Let&#39;s suppose G(x) is symmetric about x = -7, so G(x) = G(-14 - x). If we consider the polynomial G(x) - 2022, it has roots at x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅. Due to symmetry, the roots come in pairs symmetric around -7. So, except for x₃ = -7, the other roots are paired as (x₁, x₅) and (x₂, x₄). Each pair contributes two roots. So, the polynomial G(x) - 2022 has factors (x - x₁)(x - x₂)(x + 7)(x - x₄)(x - x₅). But due to symmetry, (x - x₁)(x - x₅) = (x - x₁)(x - (-14 - x₁)) = x² +14x + (x₁*(-14 - x₁) + ...). Wait, perhaps it&#39;s better to make substitution t = x + 7, so that symmetry is around t = 0. Then, G(x) = G(-14 - x) becomes G(t - 7) = G(-14 - (t -7)) = G(-14 - t +7) = G(-t -7). But that&#39;s not quite the same. Wait, maybe substitute t = x + 7. Then, x = t - 7. Then, the symmetry about x = -7 becomes symmetry about t = 0. So, G(t -7) = G(-t -7). Therefore, G(t -7) is even in t. Therefore, G(t -7) is an even function. Therefore, G(t -7) = H(t²) where H is a polynomial. Therefore, G(x) = H((x +7)^2). Therefore, G(x) - 2022 = H((x +7)^2) - 2022. Set this equal to zero. Let z = (x +7)^2. Then H(z) - 2022 = 0. We need this equation to have three real roots in z: one at z = 0 (which gives x = -7) and two positive roots z = a and z = b (which give x = -7 ±√a and x = -7 ±√b). Since we need five distinct real roots in x, z must have three distinct roots: 0, a, b, with a ≠ b and both positive. Therefore, H(z) - 2022 must be a cubic polynomial with three distinct roots. Therefore, H(z) must be a cubic polynomial. Therefore, G(x) = H((x +7)^2) must be a polynomial of degree 2*3 = 6. Hence, the minimal degree is 6. So, part (a) answer is -21, part (b) answer is 6.Final Answer(a) boxed{-21}(b) boxed{6}&lt;/think&gt;Given the polynomial ( G(x) ) with real coefficients that takes the value 2022 at exactly five different points ( x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; x_3 &lt; x_4 &lt; x_5 ), and knowing that the graph of ( y = G(x) ) is symmetric with respect to the line ( x = -7 ):(a) The symmetry about ( x = -7 ) implies that for each root ( x_i ), there is a corresponding root ( -14 - x_i ). Since there are five roots, one of them must be the midpoint ( -7 ). Therefore, the roots are ( x_1, x_2, -7, x_4, x_5 ) where ( x_1 ) and ( x_5 ) are symmetric, ( x_2 ) and ( x_4 ) are symmetric. Thus, ( x_1 + x_5 = -14 ) and ( x_2 + x_4 = -14 ). Summing these with the midpoint:[x_1 + x_3 + x_5 = (x_1 + x_5) + x_3 = -14 + (-7) = -21]The answer is (boxed{-21}).(b) To find the smallest degree of ( G(x) ), note that ( G(x) ) must be symmetric about ( x = -7 ). Using the substitution ( t = x + 7 ), ( G(x) ) becomes an even function in ( t ), i.e., ( G(x) = H((x + 7)^2) ) where ( H ) is a polynomial. The equation ( G(x) = 2022 ) translates to ( H(z) = 2022 ) with ( z = (x + 7)^2 ). This equation must have three distinct roots in ( z ): one at ( z = 0 ) (giving ( x = -7 )) and two positive roots (each giving two ( x )-values). Thus, ( H(z) - 2022 ) is a cubic polynomial, making ( H(z) ) a cubic. Therefore, ( G(x) = H((x + 7)^2) ) is a polynomial of degree ( 2 times 3 = 6 ). The smallest degree is (boxed{6}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>Answer: (a) -21 .

Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says: At the intersection O of the diagonals of the square ABCD, an arbitrary line p is drawn, which does not pass through the vertices of the square. Find the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line p, given that the side length of the square is 1 meter.Hmm, so we have a square ABCD with side length 1m. The diagonals intersect at point O. Then, we draw a line p through O, which isn&#39;t passing through any of the vertices. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex (A, B, C, D) to this line p.First, let me visualize the square. Let&#39;s suppose square ABCD has vertices A, B, C, D in order, forming a square. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at O, which is the center of the square. Since the side length is 1m, the diagonals will each have a length of sqrt(2) meters because in a square, the diagonal length is side*sqrt(2). So, each diagonal is sqrt(2) meters, and their intersection O is the midpoint, so AO = OC = BO = OD = sqrt(2)/2 meters.Now, we have a line p passing through O. Since O is the center, and p is an arbitrary line through O, not passing through any vertices. So p can be at any angle except those that align with the diagonals or the sides, I suppose. But since it&#39;s arbitrary, except for not passing through the vertices, we need a general formula that works for any such line.The problem asks for the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to line p. That is, if we denote the distance from a point to a line as d, then we need d_A^2 + d_B^2 + d_C^2 + d_D^2, where d_A is the distance from vertex A to line p, and similarly for the others.I need to recall the formula for the distance from a point to a line. If the line is given by ax + by + c = 0, then the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, maybe if I can express line p in some coordinate system, then compute the distances for each vertex.But since the square is symmetric, perhaps there&#39;s a coordinate system that would make this easier. Let me set up coordinates with O at the origin. Let me consider the square centered at the origin for simplicity. Then, since the side length is 1m, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined.Wait, if the square has side length 1m, then the distance from the center to each vertex is sqrt(2)/2 times half the diagonal. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.If the square has side length 1, then the half-diagonal is (sqrt(2))/2. Therefore, if the square is centered at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices would be (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), (-sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), (-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2), and (sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2). Wait, no, actually, that might not be correct.Wait, perhaps I should place the square in a more standard coordinate system. Let me consider square ABCD with coordinates such that O is at (0, 0). Then, if the square has side length 1, the coordinates of the vertices can be calculated as follows.In a square centered at the origin with side length 1, the coordinates would actually be (±0.5, ±0.5). Wait, that&#39;s another way to think about it. Let me check: if the square is centered at the origin and has side length 1, then each side is from -0.5 to 0.5 on either the x or y axis. So the vertices would be (0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5), and (0.5, -0.5). Then, the distance from the center (origin) to each vertex is sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) = sqrt(2)/2, which matches the half-diagonal length.Yes, that seems right. So, if the square is centered at (0,0) with side length 1, then the coordinates of the four vertices are (0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5). Then, the diagonals are along the lines y = x and y = -x.Now, the line p is an arbitrary line passing through the origin (since O is (0,0)) but not passing through any vertices. So p has to pass through the origin but cannot pass through (±0.5, ±0.5). So the line p can be represented as y = m x, where m is the slope, except for the slopes that would make the line pass through any of the vertices. Since the vertices are at (0.5, 0.5), etc., the lines that pass through the origin and a vertex would have slopes of 1, -1, 0, and infinity (vertical line). So, as long as the slope m is not 1, -1, 0, or infinity (vertical), then the line p is acceptable. But since the problem says the line is arbitrary except passing through vertices, we can assume m is any real number except those four cases.Alternatively, since the problem is about an arbitrary line through O, perhaps we can parametrize the line by an angle θ from the x-axis. Let me consider that approach. Let’s say line p makes an angle θ with the positive x-axis. Then, the equation of line p is y = tanθ x. Since it&#39;s passing through the origin.But since the line can also be vertical, which would correspond to θ = π/2, but in that case, the equation is x = 0. So, perhaps it&#39;s better to use the general form ax + by = 0, since it passes through the origin.But given that, we can represent any line through the origin as ax + by = 0, where a and b are not both zero. Then, the distance from a point (x0, y0) to this line is |a x0 + b y0| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Therefore, the square of the distance is (a x0 + b y0)^2 / (a^2 + b^2).Therefore, for each vertex (x_i, y_i), the square of the distance to line p is (a x_i + b y_i)^2 / (a^2 + b^2). Then, the sum over all four vertices would be [Σ (a x_i + b y_i)^2] / (a^2 + b^2).Therefore, if I can compute the numerator Σ (a x_i + b y_i)^2 for the four vertices, then divide by (a^2 + b^2), that will give the sum of the squares of the distances.Let me write down the coordinates of the vertices again:A: (0.5, 0.5)B: (-0.5, 0.5)C: (-0.5, -0.5)D: (0.5, -0.5)So, compute (a*0.5 + b*0.5)^2 + (a*(-0.5) + b*0.5)^2 + (a*(-0.5) + b*(-0.5))^2 + (a*0.5 + b*(-0.5))^2.Let me compute each term:First term: (0.5a + 0.5b)^2 = [0.5(a + b)]^2 = 0.25(a + b)^2Second term: (-0.5a + 0.5b)^2 = [0.5(-a + b)]^2 = 0.25(-a + b)^2 = 0.25(b - a)^2Third term: (-0.5a - 0.5b)^2 = [ -0.5(a + b) ]^2 = 0.25(a + b)^2Fourth term: (0.5a - 0.5b)^2 = [0.5(a - b)]^2 = 0.25(a - b)^2So, summing these up:0.25(a + b)^2 + 0.25(b - a)^2 + 0.25(a + b)^2 + 0.25(a - b)^2Let me compute term by term:First and third terms are both 0.25(a + b)^2. So together, they sum to 0.5(a + b)^2.Second and fourth terms are 0.25(b - a)^2 and 0.25(a - b)^2. But (b - a)^2 is the same as (a - b)^2, so both terms are 0.25(a - b)^2. So together, they sum to 0.5(a - b)^2.Therefore, total numerator is 0.5[(a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2]Now, expand (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2:= (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) + (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)= 2a^2 + 2b^2Therefore, total numerator is 0.5 * (2a^2 + 2b^2) = 0.5 * 2(a^2 + b^2) = (a^2 + b^2)Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is numerator / (a^2 + b^2) = (a^2 + b^2) / (a^2 + b^2) = 1.Wait, that&#39;s interesting. The sum is 1. So regardless of the line p through O, the sum of the squares of the distances from the four vertices to p is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1 m²? Since the distances squared would be in square meters.But let me check again, because this seems surprisingly straightforward. Let me verify with an example.Suppose line p is the x-axis, which is y = 0. Then, the distances from each vertex to the x-axis are the absolute y-coordinates. So, for A: (0.5, 0.5), distance is 0.5. Similarly, B: (-0.5, 0.5), distance 0.5. C: (-0.5, -0.5), distance 0.5. D: (0.5, -0.5), distance 0.5. So each distance is 0.5, so squares are 0.25 each. Sum is 4 * 0.25 = 1. So that works.Another example: line p is the line y = x. Wait, but the problem states that p does not pass through the vertices. However, the line y = x passes through vertices A and C. So, this is excluded. So, pick another line, say y = 0.5x. Let&#39;s compute distances.First, express line p as y = 0.5x, or in standard form: 0.5x - y = 0. So a = 0.5, b = -1.Compute distance from A(0.5, 0.5): |0.5*0.5 + (-1)*0.5| / sqrt(0.25 + 1) = |0.25 - 0.5| / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.25 | / (sqrt(5)/2) = 0.25 / (sqrt(5)/2) = 0.5 / sqrt(5)So the square is (0.5 / sqrt(5))² = 0.25 / 5 = 0.05Similarly for other points:B(-0.5, 0.5): |0.5*(-0.5) + (-1)*0.5| / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.25 - 0.5 | / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.75 | / sqrt(1.25) = 0.75 / sqrt(1.25). Square is (0.75 / sqrt(1.25))² = 0.5625 / 1.25 = 0.45C(-0.5, -0.5): |0.5*(-0.5) + (-1)*(-0.5)| / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.25 + 0.5 | / sqrt(1.25) = |0.25| / sqrt(1.25). Square is 0.0625 / 1.25 = 0.05D(0.5, -0.5): |0.5*0.5 + (-1)*(-0.5)| / sqrt(1.25) = |0.25 + 0.5| / sqrt(1.25) = 0.75 / sqrt(1.25). Square is 0.5625 / 1.25 = 0.45Sum: 0.05 + 0.45 + 0.05 + 0.45 = 1.0. So, indeed, the sum is 1.0. Therefore, this confirms the result.Therefore, regardless of the line p through O (as long as it doesn&#39;t pass through vertices, but even if it did, the formula still gives 1, though in those cases the distance from the vertex would be zero, but since the problem states that p does not pass through any vertex, we don&#39;t have to worry about division by zero or anything).So the answer is 1 m². Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is 1.But let me think again if there&#39;s another way to see this result without coordinates. Maybe using some geometric properties or symmetry.Since the square is symmetric with respect to the center O, and line p passes through O. The sum involves distances from each vertex to p. Because of the symmetry, perhaps the sum has some invariant property.Alternatively, consider that for any line through O, the square of the distance from a vertex can be related to the projection of the vertex onto the line. But maybe that&#39;s complicating.Alternatively, think about the fact that the centroid of the four vertices is at O, which is on the line p. But I don&#39;t know if that directly helps.Alternatively, use vectors. Let me consider vector projections.The distance from a point to a line can be expressed as the length of the cross product between the vector from any point on the line to the point, divided by the norm of the direction vector of the line.But in this case, since the line passes through the origin, the distance from a point (x, y) to the line is |(x, y) ⋅ (a, b)| / sqrt(a² + b²), where (a, b) is a normal vector to the line. Wait, actually, that&#39;s similar to the formula used earlier.But given that, the sum of squares of distances is [Σ (a x_i + b y_i)^2] / (a² + b²). And we saw that in this case, the numerator simplifies to (a² + b²), so the sum is 1. Therefore, regardless of a and b, as long as they are not both zero.Therefore, the answer is 1, that is, 1 m². Since the side length is 1 meter, and the distances are in meters, their squares are in square meters. So, the answer is 1 square meter.Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line p is 1.Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given a square (ABCD) with side length (1 , text{m}), we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to an arbitrary line (p) passing through the intersection (O) of the diagonals, which does not pass through any vertices.1. Coordinates of Vertices: The square is centered at the origin (O(0,0)) with vertices at (A(0.5, 0.5)), (B(-0.5, 0.5)), (C(-0.5, -0.5)), and (D(0.5, -0.5)).2. Equation of Line (p): The line (p) passing through the origin can be represented as (ax + by = 0) where (a) and (b) are not both zero.3. Distance Formula: The distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (ax + by = 0) is (frac{|ax_0 + by_0|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}). The square of this distance is (frac{(ax_0 + by_0)^2}{a^2 + b^2}).4. Sum of Squares of Distances:   - For vertex (A(0.5, 0.5)): (frac{(0.5a + 0.5b)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For vertex (B(-0.5, 0.5)): (frac{(-0.5a + 0.5b)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For vertex (C(-0.5, -0.5)): (frac{(-0.5a - 0.5b)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For vertex (D(0.5, -0.5)): (frac{(0.5a - 0.5b)^2}{a^2 + b^2})5. Summing the Squares:   - Each term is expanded and summed:     [     frac{0.25(a + b)^2 + 0.25(-a + b)^2 + 0.25(-a - b)^2 + 0.25(a - b)^2}{a^2 + b^2}     ]   - Simplifying the numerator:     [     0.5[(a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2] = 0.5[2a^2 + 2b^2] = a^2 + b^2     ]   - Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is:     [     frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2 + b^2} = 1     ]Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line (p) is (boxed{1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let&#39;s try to solve this problem. So, we have a square ABCD with side length 1 meter. The diagonals intersect at point O, and there&#39;s an arbitrary line p passing through O but not through any vertices. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to this line p. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but let&#39;s break it down.First, I need to recall how to calculate the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax₀ + by₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). So, if I can find the equation of line p and the coordinates of the vertices, I can compute each distance and then square and sum them up.Since it&#39;s a square, maybe it&#39;s easier to place it on a coordinate system with O at the origin. Let&#39;s see. If the square has side length 1, then the diagonals will be of length sqrt(2). The coordinates of the vertices can be determined if we center the square at the origin. Wait, the diagonals intersect at O, which is the center. So, coordinates of the vertices would be (½, ½), (-½, ½), (-½, -½), and (½, -½), right? Because the square is centered at O (0,0), and each side is 1m. Let me verify.If the side length is 1, then the distance from the center to each vertex along the axis is ½. But wait, actually, the half-diagonal length would be sqrt(2)/2. Hmm, maybe my coordinates are wrong. Let me think again.Wait, if the square is centered at the origin, then the coordinates of the vertices would be (a, a), (-a, a), (-a, -a), and (a, -a), such that the distance between (a, a) and (-a, a) is 2a. But that&#39;s the horizontal side length. Wait, but the distance between (a, a) and (-a, a) is 2a, but the actual side length of the square is the distance between (a, a) and (a, -a), which is 2a as well. Wait, no, that&#39;s not right. Wait, no, if the vertices are (a, a), (-a, a), (-a, -a), (a, -a), then the sides are between (a, a) and (-a, a), which is length 2a, but then the distance between (-a, a) and (-a, -a) is 2a. So actually, the side length is 2a. But in our case, the side length is 1, so 2a = 1, so a = ½. Therefore, the coordinates of the square would be (½, ½), (-½, ½), (-½, -½), (½, -½). Yes, that makes sense. So each side is 1m. For example, the distance between (½, ½) and (-½, ½) is 1, which is correct. Similarly, the distance between (-½, ½) and (-½, -½) is 1. Okay, so the coordinates are correct.Now, line p passes through O (0,0) and is arbitrary, but doesn&#39;t pass through any vertices. So, the equation of line p can be written as y = mx, where m is the slope. Since it&#39;s an arbitrary line through O, except the ones passing through the vertices. But since none of the vertices are on p, m can&#39;t be 1, -1, 0, or infinity (since those would be the slopes of the diagonals or the sides, but the problem says it doesn&#39;t pass through any vertices). However, maybe the equation of line p can also be expressed in the form ax + by = 0, since it passes through the origin. So, maybe it&#39;s better to use ax + by = 0, where a and b are not both zero. But to avoid division by zero, maybe use ax + by = 0 with a² + b² = 1 for normalization. Hmm, but perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, parametrize the line by its angle θ with the x-axis. Since it goes through the origin, the line can be represented as y = tanθ x. Then θ can be between 0 and π/2, excluding angles that make the line pass through the vertices. But maybe using θ is a good approach.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the general form ax + by = 0, and since the line is arbitrary, except through the vertices, so a and b are not such that the line would pass through (½, ½), etc. But maybe it&#39;s better not to parametrize by slope or angle, but to use the general form.But for the distance formula, if we have a line ax + by + c = 0, then the distance from (x₀, y₀) is |ax₀ + by₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Since our line p passes through the origin, c = 0. So the distance from any point (x, y) to line p is |ax + by| / sqrt(a² + b²). So, for each vertex, we can compute |a*(vertex_x) + b*(vertex_y)| / sqrt(a² + b²), square it, and sum them up.So, the four vertices are (½, ½), (-½, ½), (-½, -½), (½, -½). Let&#39;s compute the distance squared from each to line p.For the first vertex (½, ½):Distance squared = [ |a*(½) + b*(½)| / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = [ (½ |a + b| ) / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = (¼ (a + b)^2) / (a² + b²)Similarly, for the second vertex (-½, ½):Distance squared = [ |a*(-½) + b*(½)| / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = [ (½ | -a + b | ) / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = (¼ ( -a + b )² ) / (a² + b² )Third vertex (-½, -½):Distance squared = [ |a*(-½) + b*(-½)| / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = [ (½ | -a - b | ) / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = (¼ (a + b)^2 ) / (a² + b² )Fourth vertex (½, -½):Distance squared = [ |a*(½) + b*(-½)| / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = [ (½ | a - b | ) / sqrt(a² + b²) ]² = (¼ (a - b)^2 ) / (a² + b² )Now, summing all four distances squared:Sum = [ (¼ (a + b)^2 ) + (¼ (-a + b)^2 ) + (¼ (a + b)^2 ) + (¼ (a - b)^2 ) ] / (a² + b² )Let&#39;s compute the numerator:First term: ¼ (a + b)^2Second term: ¼ ( (-a + b)^2 ) = ¼ (a - b)^2Third term: ¼ (a + b)^2Fourth term: ¼ (a - b)^2So, combining like terms:Sum numerator = ¼ [ (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 + (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 ]That&#39;s ¼ [ 2*(a + b)^2 + 2*(a - b)^2 ]Factor out 2: ¼ * 2 [ (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 ] = ½ [ (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 ]Compute (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² + a² - 2ab + b² = 2a² + 2b² = 2(a² + b²)So, numerator becomes ½ * 2(a² + b²) = (a² + b²)Therefore, the sum is (a² + b²) / (a² + b² ) = 1.Wait, so the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line p is 1? But the side length is 1m, so is this correct?Wait, let&#39;s check the calculations again. Let me retrace.Starting with the distance squared for each vertex:1. (½, ½): ( (½a + ½b ) / sqrt(a² + b²) )² = ( (a + b)/2 )² / (a² + b² ) = (a + b)^2 / (4(a² + b²))Similarly for others:2. (-½, ½): ( (-a + b)/2 )² / (a² + b² ) = ( (-a + b)^2 ) / (4(a² + b²))3. (-½, -½): ( (-a - b)/2 )² / (a² + b² ) = ( (a + b)^2 ) / (4(a² + b²)) same as first4. (½, -½): ( (a - b)/2 )² / (a² + b² ) = ( (a - b)^2 ) / (4(a² + b²))Sum them up:[ (a + b)^2 + (-a + b)^2 + (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 ] / [4(a² + b²)]Wait, the denominator is 4(a² + b²), numerator is sum of those four terms.Wait, (-a + b)^2 is same as (b - a)^2 which is same as (a - b)^2. Similarly, the terms are:First term: (a + b)^2Second term: (a - b)^2Third term: (a + b)^2Fourth term: (a - b)^2So, numerator is 2*(a + b)^2 + 2*(a - b)^2Which is 2[(a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2]Expanding each:(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b²(a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b²Adding them gives 2a² + 2b²So, numerator becomes 2*(2a² + 2b²) = 4a² + 4b² = 4(a² + b²)Therefore, the total sum is [4(a² + b²)] / [4(a² + b²)] = 1So the sum is 1. Therefore, regardless of the line p through O, the sum of the squares of the distances is 1. Hmm, but the side length is 1m, so 1 is in meters squared? Wait, but distance squared would have units m², and the sum is 1 m²? So the answer is 1? But that seems too straightforward. Wait, but according to the calculation, it&#39;s indeed 1. Let me verify with a specific case.Take the line p as the x-axis. Then the equation is y = 0. Then the distances from each vertex to this line:(½, ½): distance is |½| = ½, squared is ¼(-½, ½): same, ½, squared ¼(-½, -½): distance is | -½ | = ½, squared ¼(½, -½): same, ½, squared ¼Sum is 4*(¼) = 1. So that works.Another example: take the line y = x, which is one of the diagonals. But the problem states that p does not pass through any vertices. Wait, but the diagonals pass through the vertices, so p cannot be a diagonal. Wait, but in the problem statement, it&#39;s given that p is an arbitrary line through O, not passing through the vertices. So, if we take a different line, say y = 0.5x. Let&#39;s compute the distances.First, line p: y = 0.5x, or equivalently, 0.5x - y = 0. So a = 0.5, b = -1, but to make it ax + by = 0, it&#39;s 0.5x - y = 0. Let&#39;s compute distances.First vertex (½, ½):Distance = |0.5*(½) - 1*(½)| / sqrt(0.5² + (-1)² ) = |0.25 - 0.5| / sqrt(0.25 + 1) = | -0.25 | / sqrt(1.25) = 0.25 / (sqrt(5)/2) = 0.25 * 2 / sqrt(5) = 0.5 / sqrt(5)Squared: (0.5 / sqrt(5))² = 0.25 / 5 = 0.05Second vertex (-½, ½):Distance = |0.5*(-½) - 1*(½)| / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.25 - 0.5 | / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.75 | / sqrt(1.25) = 0.75 / sqrt(5)/2 = 0.75 * 2 / sqrt(5) = 1.5 / sqrt(5)Squared: (1.5 / sqrt(5))² = 2.25 / 5 = 0.45Third vertex (-½, -½):Distance = |0.5*(-½) - 1*(-½)| / sqrt(1.25) = | -0.25 + 0.5 | / sqrt(1.25) = |0.25| / sqrt(1.25) = 0.25 / (sqrt(5)/2) = 0.5 / sqrt(5)Squared: 0.05Fourth vertex (½, -½):Distance = |0.5*(½) - 1*(-½)| / sqrt(1.25) = |0.25 + 0.5| / sqrt(1.25) = 0.75 / sqrt(1.25) = 0.75 * 2 / sqrt(5) = 1.5 / sqrt(5)Squared: 0.45Sum: 0.05 + 0.45 + 0.05 + 0.45 = 1. Which matches the previous result. So, it seems correct. Therefore, regardless of the line through O, the sum is always 1 m².Therefore, the answer should be boxed{1}.But wait, the problem says &quot;the length of the side of the square is 1 m&quot;. So the answer is 1 (meter squared), but since units are given, maybe it&#39;s 1 m², but in the problem statement, they just say &quot;Find the sum...&quot;, and since the side is given in meters, the distances would be in meters, so the squares would be in m². Therefore, the answer is 1 m², but in the problem, they might just want the numerical value with unit. But the original problem states &quot;Find the sum... if the length of the side of the square is 1 m.&quot; So probably the answer is 1, boxed as boxed{1}.Yes, because in both examples, the sum was 1, and the general case also gives 1, regardless of the line. So the answer must be 1. Therefore, the answer is boxed{1}.Final Answerboxed{1}&lt;/think&gt;Given a square (ABCD) with side length (1 mathrm{~m}), the diagonals intersect at point (O). An arbitrary line (p) passes through (O) but not through any vertices. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line (p).1. Coordinates of the vertices: The square is centered at the origin (O(0,0)) with vertices at ((frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2})), ((-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2})), ((-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2})), and ((frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2})).2. Equation of line (p): Since (p) passes through the origin, it can be written as (ax + by = 0) where (a) and (b) are constants.3. Distance formula: The distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to the line (ax + by = 0) is (frac{|ax_0 + by_0|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}). Squaring this distance gives (frac{(ax_0 + by_0)^2}{a^2 + b^2}).4. Calculating distances for each vertex:   - For ((frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2})): (frac{(a cdot frac{1}{2} + b cdot frac{1}{2})^2}{a^2 + b^2} = frac{left(frac{a + b}{2}right)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For ((-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2})): (frac{(a cdot -frac{1}{2} + b cdot frac{1}{2})^2}{a^2 + b^2} = frac{left(frac{-a + b}{2}right)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For ((-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2})): (frac{(a cdot -frac{1}{2} + b cdot -frac{1}{2})^2}{a^2 + b^2} = frac{left(frac{-a - b}{2}right)^2}{a^2 + b^2})   - For ((frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2})): (frac{(a cdot frac{1}{2} + b cdot -frac{1}{2})^2}{a^2 + b^2} = frac{left(frac{a - b}{2}right)^2}{a^2 + b^2})5. Summing the squared distances:   - Sum = (frac{(a + b)^2 + (-a + b)^2 + (-a - b)^2 + (a - b)^2}{4(a^2 + b^2)})   - Simplifying the numerator: ((a + b)^2 + (-a + b)^2 + (-a - b)^2 + (a - b)^2 = 2(a + b)^2 + 2(a - b)^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2))   - Therefore, the sum = (frac{4(a^2 + b^2)}{4(a^2 + b^2)} = 1)Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from each vertex to the line (p) is (boxed{1}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>Solution.

Let me start by recalling what I know about logistic growth models. The S-shaped curve, or logistic growth, describes how a population grows rapidly at first when resources are plentiful, but growth slows down as resources become limited. The curve eventually levels off at the carrying capacity, denoted as K. The question gives four options, A to D. Let me go through each one step by step.Statement A: &quot;In nature, the population growth curve of most species eventually takes an &#39;S&#39; shape.&quot; Hmm. I know the logistic model is a theoretical one. In reality, populations might not always reach a perfect S-shape because of various factors like environmental fluctuations, predation, disease, etc. Some species might exhibit boom-and-bust cycles, or their growth might be interrupted before reaching K. So maybe A is incorrect because while the logistic model is a common concept, in reality, many populations don&#39;t actually show a perfect S-curve. But the statement says &quot;most species&quot;—maybe the question assumes that in theory, even if not in practice. Or perhaps the question is more about the model&#39;s statements. I need to keep this in mind and check the other options.Statement B: &quot;When reaching the value K, the population growth rate is zero.&quot; That&#39;s straight from the logistic equation. The formula for logistic growth is dN/dt = rN((K - N)/K). When N equals K, (K - N)/K becomes zero, so the growth rate dN/dt is zero. So B is correct. So B is not the incorrect statement.Statement C: &quot;Population growth is influenced by its own density.&quot; Yes, that&#39;s density-dependent growth. The logistic model incorporates density dependence because the per capita growth rate decreases as the population (N) approaches K. Factors like competition for resources, disease transmission, etc., which are density-dependent, influence the growth rate. So C is correct. So C is not the answer.Statement D: &quot;The growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; Wait, in the logistic model, the growth rate starts increasing when the population is low because there are enough resources. Then as N approaches K, the growth rate decreases. But does it &quot;gradually decrease&quot; over the entire time? Let me think. The curve is S-shaped, so initially, the growth rate increases (the curve&#39;s slope becomes steeper), reaches an inflection point where growth rate is maximum, and then the growth rate decreases as N approaches K. So the growth rate first increases, peaks, then decreases. So statement D says &quot;the growth rate gradually decreases&quot;—if D is claiming that the growth rate is always decreasing, that&#39;s incorrect because before the inflection point, the growth rate is actually increasing. So D would be incorrect. Wait, but let me check the wording again. The statement says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If the total population&#39;s growth rate (dN/dt) is meant here, then initially, the growth rate increases as N increases, up to the inflection point at K/2, after which the growth rate decreases. So the growth rate doesn&#39;t gradually decrease the entire time; it first increases then decreases. So D is incorrect because it&#39;s not a gradual decrease throughout. However, maybe the statement is referring to the per capita growth rate? The per capita growth rate (r*(1 - N/K)) does decrease gradually as N increases. Wait, but the question is about the &quot;growth rate of the population&quot;—which is dN/dt. So yes, if the statement D is about dN/dt, then it&#39;s incorrect because the growth rate first increases then decreases. But if it&#39;s about per capita growth rate, then D would be correct. The wording is crucial here. Let me check the original question again. It says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; Typically, &quot;growth rate&quot; in this context refers to dN/dt, the absolute growth rate. So if that&#39;s the case, then statement D is incorrect because the growth rate doesn&#39;t gradually decrease throughout; it first increases, peaks, then decreases. So D would be the incorrect statement. But wait, let&#39;s cross-verify with the answer options. Let me recap:So the options are:A: Most species in nature show S-shape. (But in reality, many factors make actual populations not follow the model perfectly. But maybe the question is considering the model&#39;s assumptions. If the question says &quot;in nature, most species,&quot; is that correct? The logistic model is a simplification. In reality, some populations might approximate it, but not all. So A might be incorrect if it&#39;s making a factual claim that most species do this. However, the question is about which statement is incorrect regarding the S-shaped curve. So maybe A is incorrect because in reality, not most species follow the S-curve. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting A to be correct. Hmm. This is a point of confusion. Let me check the other options again.If D is incorrect because the growth rate first increases then decreases, while the statement says it &quot;gradually decreases,&quot; which would be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question&#39;s answer is D. But let&#39;s check again.Wait, maybe the confusion arises between the per capita growth rate and the total growth rate. Let&#39;s clarify:- In exponential growth, the per capita growth rate is constant (r), so the total growth rate (dN/dt = rN) increases as N increases.- In logistic growth, the per capita growth rate decreases as N approaches K (r*(1 - N/K)), so the total growth rate (dN/dt = rN*(1 - N/K)) first increases when N is low (because even though per capita rate is decreasing, N is increasing, leading to a higher total rate until N reaches K/2), then decreases after N surpasses K/2.So if statement D is referring to the total growth rate (dN/dt), then D is incorrect because it first increases then decreases. But the statement says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If &quot;gradually decreases&quot; is supposed to mean &quot;continuously decreases from the start,&quot; then that&#39;s wrong. However, the growth rate does eventually start decreasing. So maybe the wording is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the answer intended here is D, considering that the growth rate does not decrease gradually but first increases then decreases. So statement D is incorrect.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A. Let me think again. The question is which statement is incorrect. The options are about the S-shaped curve. The logistic model is a theoretical construct. In reality, some populations might exhibit logistic growth under certain conditions, but many factors can cause fluctuations, so perhaps statement A is incorrect because it says &quot;most species eventually take an S-shape,&quot; which might not be true in nature. For example, many populations might exhibit other patterns like J-shaped (if they overshoot and crash) or fluctuate around K. So in that case, statement A would be incorrect. However, the problem is wording: &quot;when reaching the value K, the population growth rate is zero.&quot; In reality, K is not a fixed value and can change, but in the model, yes. So B is correct according to the model.So now I&#39;m confused between A and D. Which one is incorrect?Let me look at each statement again:A: In nature, the population growth curve of most species eventually takes an &quot;S&quot; shape.This is likely incorrect. In reality, many populations do not reach a stable K due to environmental factors, so their growth might not form a perfect S-curve. Instead, they might fluctuate, crash, or exhibit other patterns. So A&#39;s statement that &quot;most&quot; do this is probably incorrect. Therefore, A is the incorrect statement.But wait, the options are about the S-shaped curve itself. The question is which statement about the S-shaped curve is incorrect. So perhaps statement A is making a claim about nature, but in the context of the model&#39;s assumptions. If the S-curve model is about idealized conditions, then A&#39;s assertion about &quot;in nature&quot; might be wrong. So the answer could be A.Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that A is correct. Wait, the logistic model applies when resources are limited, which is common in nature, so perhaps the model is considered to approximate many real populations, hence A is correct. But again, in reality, perfect logistic growth is rare. So the answer depends on whether the question is focused on the model&#39;s properties or real-world observations.But looking at the options again, statement D says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If we&#39;re talking about the total growth rate (dN/dt), then in the logistic model, the growth rate first increases to a maximum at K/2 and then decreases. So D&#39;s statement that it &quot;gradually decreases&quot; is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t decrease from the start; it increases first. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.But wait, the wording in D is &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If &quot;gradually&quot; here implies a continuous process, even if it first increases then decreases, but perhaps the decrease after the inflection point is gradual. But the problem is that the growth rate doesn&#39;t start decreasing right away. So D&#39;s statement is incorrect because the growth rate doesn&#39;t gradually decrease throughout the entire period. It increases, peaks, then decreases. So the entire time, it&#39;s not decreasing. Therefore, D is incorrect.So now I&#39;m stuck between A and D.Wait, let&#39;s check some textbooks. In the logistic growth model:- The population growth rate (dN/dt) is highest at N = K/2 (inflection point).- Before that point, dN/dt is increasing.- After that point, dN/dt decreases.So if a statement claims that the growth rate &quot;gradually decreases,&quot; that&#39;s only true after the inflection point. But the entire growth process includes both an increasing and decreasing phase in terms of dN/dt. So statement D is incorrect because it says the growth rate gradually decreases, implying a continuous decrease from the start, which isn&#39;t the case. Therefore, D is the incorrect statement.But wait, maybe the question is in Chinese, and &quot;growth rate&quot; might be translated in a way that refers to the per capita growth rate. If so, then the per capita growth rate does decrease gradually as N increases. In that case, statement D would be correct. But the question is in English here, so &quot;growth rate of the population&quot; is more likely to refer to dN/dt, the absolute growth rate, not per capita. So D would be incorrect.In that case, the answer is D. But I need to confirm. Let&#39;s think of each option again:A: If in nature, most species follow S-curve. Probably not, because in reality, factors cause fluctuations. But maybe in the context of this question, which is about the logistic model, A is considered correct as an assumption. But the statement says &quot;in nature,&quot; which might not hold. So A is incorrect.But the problem is to choose which statement about the S-shaped curve is incorrect. So the incorrect statement would be the one that contradicts the logistic model&#39;s properties. Let&#39;s analyze each statement in the context of the model:A: In nature, most species follow S-shape. The logistic model is a theoretical model; the statement&#39;s claim about nature might not be accurate. But the question is asking which statement about the S-shaped curve is incorrect. So if the S-curve model assumes that populations will reach K and have an S-shape, but in reality, this might not happen, does that make A incorrect? The statement is about nature, not the model. So if A is claiming that in reality, most species do this, then A is incorrect. But if the question is about the model&#39;s characteristics, then A might not be part of the model&#39;s claims. The options are statements about the S-shaped curve, so perhaps they&#39;re all supposed to be properties of the model. Wait, but A says &quot;in nature,&quot; so it&#39;s a statement about real-world populations. The S-shaped curve is a model. So if A is incorrect in reality, then A is the answer. So which is more likely to be the incorrect statement?Alternatively, maybe the answer is D. Let me check the options again:Statement D: &quot;The growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If we&#39;re talking about the absolute growth rate (dN/dt), then this is incorrect because it first increases then decreases. If it&#39;s about per capita growth rate, then it&#39;s correct. But usually, when someone mentions &quot;growth rate&quot; without qualification, they mean the absolute growth rate (dN/dt), not per capita. So in that case, D is incorrect.Therefore, between A and D, which is the incorrect statement?The problem is to choose the incorrect statement about the S-shaped curve. So:- A is a claim about reality. The S-curve is a model. The model might not perfectly fit most species in nature. So if A is incorrect, then the answer is A.But in the context of the model&#39;s assumptions, the S-curve is considered to apply when resources are limited, which is common, so maybe A is correct. But maybe in reality, most populations experience other factors and don&#39;t follow the S-curve. Therefore, A is incorrect.Alternatively, the answer might be D.This is tricky. Let me think of other aspects. For example, in the logistic model, the growth rate does decrease after the inflection point, but before that, it increases. So the growth rate doesn&#39;t &quot;gradually decrease&quot; the entire time. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.Alternatively, maybe the original question intended D to be correct. Hmm.Another approach: Let&#39;s consider each statement:A: Incorrect? Maybe. If most species in nature actually do not show S-shaped growth due to other factors, then A is incorrect.B: Correct according to the model.C: Correct, since logistic growth is density-dependent.D: If the growth rate (dN/dt) first increases then decreases, then D is incorrect because it says &quot;gradually decreases,&quot; implying a continuous decrease. Therefore, D is incorrect.So between A and D, which is the answer?If both A and D are incorrect, but only one can be chosen, perhaps the answer is D.Wait, but the question is in Chinese maybe, so let me check the options again.Original question in Chinese context? The user hasn&#39;t specified, but the options are labeled in English. So likely, it&#39;s a standard biology question.In standard textbooks, for logistic growth, the population growth rate (dN/dt) initially increases, reaches a maximum at K/2, then decreases. So statement D says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases,&quot; which would be incorrect because it increases first. Therefore, D is incorrect.Meanwhile, statement A says that in nature, most species&#39; population growth eventually takes S-shape. However, in reality, many populations exhibit fluctuations, so A&#39;s assertion is likely incorrect. But maybe the question is from a model&#39;s perspective, not reality. However, the statement specifically says &quot;in nature,&quot; which might not be accurate. So A is incorrect.But how to decide between A and D?Wait, if the answer is D, then it&#39;s because the growth rate doesn&#39;t always decrease. If the answer is A, it&#39;s because most species don&#39;t show S-curves in nature.But which one is more incorrect?In many biology textbooks, they do mention that the logistic model is a simplification and that real populations may show different patterns. So statement A would be incorrect because it claims that in nature, most species follow an S-curve, which isn&#39;t true. So A is the incorrect statement.But I&#39;m now confused because I thought D was incorrect.Alternatively, maybe both A and D are incorrect, but since we have to choose one.Let me check the options again. The question is from a test, so there&#39;s only one correct answer. Let&#39;s try to find out which is more likely.Looking up similar questions online, for example, a common question is about the logistic growth curve. A question like this usually has the incorrect statement being that the growth rate decreases throughout, which is D, because in reality, the growth rate first increases then decreases. So D is incorrect.Meanwhile, statement A might be considered correct if the question assumes that under natural conditions with limited resources, populations trend towards an S-curve, even if in reality there are fluctuations. But strictly speaking, in nature, perfect S-curves are rare. However, the question might be theoretical, so statement A would be correct, and D is incorrect.Therefore, the answer is D.&lt;/think&gt;The incorrect statement about the &quot;S&quot; shaped curve of population growth is D: The growth rate of the population gradually decreases. Analysis:- Statement A claims that most species in nature eventually show an S-shaped growth curve. While the logistic model is theoretical, real-world populations often face environmental variability, leading to fluctuations rather than a perfect S-curve. However, this statement might be interpreted as a generalization of the model&#39;s applicability, leaving some ambiguity.- Statement B is correct because, in the logistic model, when the population reaches carrying capacity (K), the growth rate (dN/dt) becomes zero.- Statement C is correct as the logistic model inherently incorporates density-dependent factors, where growth slows as population density increases.- Statement D is incorrect because the absolute growth rate (dN/dt) in the logistic model first *increases* as the population grows (before reaching K/2), peaks at the inflection point, and then decreases. The phrase &quot;gradually decreases&quot; inaccurately implies a continuous decline from the start, which contradicts the model&#39;s behavior.Thus, D is the most clearly incorrect statement based on the logistic growth model&#39;s dynamics.boxed{D},&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about the S-shaped (sigmoid) population growth curve is incorrect. Let&#39;s go through each option one by one.First, I remember that the S-curve is associated with logistic growth, right? Unlike exponential growth where the population keeps increasing, logistic growth accounts for limited resources and carrying capacity (K). So as the population approaches K, growth slows down and stabilizes.Looking at option A: &quot;In nature, the population growth curve of most species eventually takes an &#39;S&#39; shape.&quot; Hmm. I think in reality, many factors can prevent populations from smoothly reaching K. There might be fluctuations, overshooting K, or other environmental disturbances. So maybe most species don&#39;t actually show a perfect S-curve? But I also recall that the logistic model is a simplification. Maybe the question is more theoretical. If the question is about the model, then in theory, under ideal conditions with density dependence, it would be S-shaped. But the statement says &quot;in nature,&quot; which is more about real-world scenarios. So perhaps A is incorrect because in nature, it&#39;s not always a perfect S-shape due to other factors. But wait, the question says &quot;most species&quot;—maybe many do approximate an S-shape over time. Not sure yet.Option B: &quot;When reaching the value K, the population growth rate is zero.&quot; That&#39;s straight from the logistic equation. At K, the growth rate (dN/dt) is zero because (K - N)/K becomes zero. So B is correct.Option C: &quot;Population growth is influenced by its own density.&quot; Yes, that&#39;s the definition of density-dependent growth, which is what the logistic model is about. As population increases, resources become limited, so growth rate decreases. So C is correct.Option D: &quot;The growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; Wait, in logistic growth, the growth rate starts increasing initially (when the population is small and resources are abundant) up to the inflection point, then decreases after that. So the growth rate (dN/dt) actually increases first and then decreases. So if the question says &quot;gradually decreases&quot; from the start, that&#39;s incorrect. But the wording here is &quot;gradually decreases&quot;—maybe as the population approaches K, the growth rate does decrease. But overall, the trend after the inflection point is decreasing. But does the growth rate of the population (the number of individuals added per time) decrease gradually throughout? Wait, no. In the logistic model, when the population is small, growth rate is low, then increases as the population grows to mid-size (inflection point), then decreases again. So initially, the growth rate increases, then decreases. So statement D says &quot;the growth rate gradually decreases.&quot; If &quot;gradually decreases&quot; refers to the entire time, then D is incorrect because the growth rate first increases and then decreases. But if the question is considering after the inflection point, then maybe. But the statement D doesn&#39;t specify a time frame. So D is incorrect because the growth rate doesn&#39;t always decrease—it first increases then decreases. So D is a wrong statement.But wait, let me check again. The S-shaped curve refers to the population over time. The growth rate (dN/dt) is highest at the inflection point. So initially, when the population is low, the growth rate is low (since there are few individuals to reproduce), then increases as the population grows (more individuals contributing to growth), reaches maximum at inflection, then decreases as resources become limited. So the growth rate first increases, then decreases. Therefore, the statement D says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases&quot;—which would be incorrect because it first increases. So D is incorrect.But wait, maybe the question is referring to the slope of the S-curve. The S-curve&#39;s slope (which is the growth rate) starts increasing, then decreases. So the rate of population growth (the derivative) increases, peaks, then decreases. So from the start, the growth rate increases until the inflection point, then decreases. So the growth rate doesn&#39;t &quot;gradually decrease&quot; overall. So statement D is incorrect.But the options are about which is incorrect. So A, B, C, D. Let&#39;s recap:A: In nature, most species have S-shaped curves. Maybe not, since real populations might fluctuate or have other factors. So A could be incorrect.B: Correct.C: Correct.D: Incorrect because growth rate first increases then decreases.So between A and D. If the question is about the logistic model (theoretical), then D is incorrect. If the question is about real-world (as A says &quot;in nature&quot;), then A might be incorrect.The question states: &quot;Which of the following statements about the &#39;S&#39; shaped curve of population growth is incorrect?&quot; So the statements are about the S-shaped curve model, not necessarily real-world accuracy. So maybe A is incorrect because &quot;in nature, most species&quot; do not necessarily follow the S-curve exactly. The logistic model is a theoretical construct, and in reality, many populations might not reach a stable K due to environmental variations, predation, etc. So A is making a claim about nature, which might be incorrect.But in the model, the S-curve is expected when density-dependent factors are in play. So maybe the question is testing knowledge of the model, not real-world accuracy. So D is incorrect in the model? Wait, in the logistic model, does the growth rate (dN/dt) first increase, then decrease. So statement D says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; If &quot;growth rate&quot; refers to dN/dt, then it&#39;s not true that it gradually decreases—it first increases then decreases. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.But maybe the question is using &quot;growth rate&quot; differently. If &quot;growth rate&quot; is the per capita growth rate (r), then in logistic growth, the per capita growth rate decreases as the population increases. Because the equation is dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K). The per capita growth rate is r(1 - N/K), which does decrease as N approaches K. So if statement D is referring to per capita growth rate, then D is correct. But if it&#39;s referring to the total growth rate (dN/dt), then D is incorrect because dN/dt first increases then decreases. So this is ambiguous.The wording of the options is crucial. The question says &quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases.&quot; &quot;Growth rate&quot; here is likely referring to dN/dt (the total growth rate, not per capita). Because per capita is more about individuals. So if it&#39;s dN/dt, then the statement D is incorrect because the growth rate first increases then decreases. However, if &quot;growth rate&quot; refers to the per capita rate, then D is correct. So this depends on terminology.But in standard terminology, when they talk about population growth rate without specifying, it&#39;s usually dN/dt. So in that case, D is incorrect. But I need to check standard definitions.Looking up, for example, in ecology textbooks: population growth rate is typically dN/dt, the change in population over time. The per capita growth rate is (dN/dt)/N. So in logistic growth, dN/dt is rN(1 - N/K). When N is small, dN/dt increases as N increases (since more individuals contribute to growth). After the inflection point (at K/2), dN/dt starts decreasing. So the total growth rate (dN/dt) first increases, then decreases. Therefore, statement D (&quot;the growth rate of the population gradually decreases&quot;) is incorrect because it doesn&#39;t account for the initial increase. So D is incorrect.But then what about option A? The statement A says &quot;in nature, the population growth curve of most species eventually takes an &#39;S&#39; shape.&quot; In reality, many populations exhibit fluctuations, boom and bust cycles, or other patterns. Truly stable populations that reach K and stay there are probably rare. So A might be incorrect as well. However, the question is about the S-shaped model. If we are to consider the model&#39;s assumptions, then A might be incorrect because the model is a simplification. But the options are statements about the S-shaped curve. So if the S-shaped curve applies when density-dependent factors are in play, then in nature, density dependence does occur, so maybe many populations do approximate an S-shape. But in reality, it&#39;s not perfect. But the question is about which statement is incorrect regarding the S-shaped curve. If the statement A is making a claim that in nature most species do this, which might not be the case, then A is incorrect. Alternatively, if the S-curve is considered a common theoretical outcome, then A might be correct. But I think in exam settings, the S-curve is considered a common model, so A could be considered correct. But maybe the answer is D.So perhaps the incorrect statement is D. Because the growth rate (dN/dt) does not gradually decrease; it first increases then decreases. Alternatively, if &quot;growth rate&quot; is per capita, then D is correct. But given the options and standard terminology, D is likely incorrect.Alternatively, maybe statement D is correct because as the population grows, even though initially the growth rate increases, the overall trend after a certain point is decreasing, so maybe &quot;gradually decreases&quot; refers to after the inflection point. But the statement doesn&#39;t specify, so it&#39;s ambiguous. However, since the entire process includes both increasing and decreasing phases, D is incorrect because it says the growth rate &quot;gradually decreases&quot; without qualification.So between A and D. I need to recall the original question. Which is incorrect about the S-shaped curve. Statement A: in nature, most species have S-shaped growth. In reality, many factors like environmental stochasticity, time lags, etc., cause populations to fluctuate around K, not settle perfectly. So A is incorrect because it&#39;s too broad. The S-curve is a model, but in reality, it&#39;s not most species. However, in some cases, maybe when resources are strictly limited and no other factors interfere, but in nature, that&#39;s rare. So A is incorrect. But if the question is from a textbook that says that the logistic model applies to many populations, then maybe A is considered correct. Alternatively, the answer might be D.Alternatively, let&#39;s check each statement:A: In nature, most species&#39; populations eventually take S-shape. Unlikely, since many populations fluctuate or crash, so A is incorrect.B: At K, growth rate zero. Correct.C: Growth influenced by density. Correct.D: Growth rate gradually decreases. If growth rate is dN/dt, then no—it first increases, peaks, then decreases. So D is incorrect.So both A and D are incorrect? But the question says &quot;which of the following is incorrect&quot;—singular. So maybe I made a mistake.Wait, maybe the key is in the term &quot;gradually decreases&quot;. Even though the growth rate first increases and then decreases, maybe from the time the population starts, the growth rate is decreasing? Wait no. Initially, when N is small, dN/dt is low. Then as N increases, dN/dt increases (since there are more individuals reproducing). At N=K/2, dN/dt is maximum. After that, as N approaches K, dN/dt decreases. So overall, the growth rate (dN/dt) increases to a maximum and then decreases. Therefore, the growth rate doesn&#39;t &quot;gradually decrease&quot; throughout. It first increases then decreases. So statement D is incorrect because it claims the growth rate &quot;gradually decreases&quot; without acknowledging the initial increase. Hence, D is incorrect.Statement A: if the question is about the model&#39;s applicability in nature, then A is incorrect. But the S-curve is a theoretical model, and in nature, populations might not follow it exactly. But the problem is which statement about the &quot;S&quot; shaped curve is incorrect. So if A is making a claim about nature, while the S-curve is a model, then perhaps A is incorrect. However, the model does predict that populations under density-dependent regulation will follow S-shaped curves. So in nature, where density dependence is a factor, maybe many populations do approximate S-curves. So maybe A is correct.So perhaps the incorrect answer is D. Because the growth rate first increases then decreases, so D is incorrect. The answer is D.&lt;/think&gt;The incorrect statement about the &quot;S&quot; shaped curve of population growth is D. Here&#39;s the reasoning:- Option A: While real-world populations often experience fluctuations, the logistic model (S-shaped curve) assumes density-dependent regulation. In theory, many species in nature approximate this pattern under stable conditions, so this statement is broadly correct.  - Option B: At carrying capacity ((K)), the population growth rate ((dN/dt)) becomes zero, as ((1 - N/K)) cancels out reproduction. This is a core tenet of the logistic model and is correct.  - Option C: Density dependence is central to the logistic growth model. As population size increases, resource limitations reduce per capita growth, making this statement correct.  - Option D: The total population growth rate ((dN/dt)) does not &quot;gradually decrease&quot; throughout. Initially, as the population grows, (dN/dt) increases (due to more individuals contributing to growth), peaks at (K/2) (inflection point), and then decreases as (N) approaches (K). The claim that the growth rate &quot;gradually decreases&quot; ignores the initial increase, making this statement incorrect.Answer: boxed{D}]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>Option A is correct because, due to limitations in space and resources, the population growth curve of most biological species in nature usually takes an &quot;S&quot; shape. When the population size reaches the value K, the birth rate equals the death rate, and the population growth rate is 0, so the statement in option B is correct. The increase in population size, besides being affected by environmental factors, is also influenced by the increase in population density, which intensifies the competition within the species, affecting the growth of the population size. Therefore, the statement in option C is also correct. The growth rate of the population initially increases gradually, and when the population size is greater than K/2, the growth rate of the population begins to decrease.Therefore, the incorrect statement is boxed{text{D}}.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-c9a649a3 data-v-cb5dd192><div class="review" data-v-cb5dd192><div class="review-title" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>❓:</span>9,10,11 |Solve the equation x^{3}+x-2=0 by trial and error and using Cardano&#39;s formula.</div><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🧠:</span>[&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve the equation x³ + x - 2 = 0 using both trial and error and Cardano&#39;s formula. Hmm, let me start with the trial and error method because that seems simpler. First, trial and error. I should test some integer values to see if they satisfy the equation. Let&#39;s try x=1: 1³ + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Oh! That works. So x=1 is a root. Wait, but cubic equations have three roots, right? So maybe this is the only real root, and the other two are complex? Let me check if there are other real roots. Let me try x=2: 8 + 2 - 2 = 8, which is positive. x=0: 0 + 0 - 2 = -2, which is negative. So since the function is continuous, and it goes from negative at x=0 to positive at x=2, and we already found a root at x=1, maybe that&#39;s the only real root. Let me check x= -1: (-1)³ + (-1) -2 = -1 -1 -2 = -4, still negative. So between x=-2 and x=0 it&#39;s negative, x=0 to x=1 it goes from -2 to 0, and x=1 to x=2 it goes from 0 to 8. So seems like x=1 is the only real root. So by trial and error, I found x=1. Then, to find the other roots, maybe I can factor the cubic equation. Since x=1 is a root, (x - 1) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Dividing x³ + x - 2 by (x - 1). Using synthetic division:Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), 1 (x), -2 (constant term)Bring down 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next term: 0 +1 =1. Multiply by 1:1. Add to next term:1 +1=2. Multiply by1:2. Add to last term: -2 +2=0. So the quotient polynomial is x² + x +2. Therefore, x³ + x -2 = (x -1)(x² +x +2). Now, the quadratic equation x² +x +2=0 can be solved using quadratic formula. Discriminant D=1² - 4*1*2=1 -8= -7. So roots are [-1 ± sqrt(-7)]/2 = (-1 ± i√7)/2. So the three roots are x=1, x=(-1 + i√7)/2, and x=(-1 -i√7)/2.But the problem also asks to use Cardano&#39;s formula. Let me try that method as well. Maybe I can verify the real root through Cardano&#39;s method. Cardano&#39;s formula is for solving cubic equations of the form t³ + pt + q = 0. Our equation is x³ + x -2=0, which fits this form with p=1 and q= -2. According to Cardano&#39;s formula, the roots are given by t = cube root(-q/2 + sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3)) + cube root(-q/2 - sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3))Let me compute each part step by step. First, compute q/2: -2/2 = -1. Then, (q/2)^2 = (-1)^2=1. Then, (p/3)^3 = (1/3)^3 = 1/27. So the expression under the square root is 1 + 1/27 = 28/27. So sqrt(28/27) = sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) = (2*sqrt(7))/(3*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(21))/9. Wait, maybe rationalizing the denominator: sqrt(28/27) = sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) = (2*sqrt(7))/(3*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(21))/9. Hmm, not sure if that&#39;s necessary yet. So then, the first term inside the cube roots is -q/2 plus sqrt(...). Wait, according to the formula, it&#39;s t = cube_root( -q/2 + sqrt( (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 ) ) + cube_root( -q/2 - sqrt( (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 ) )Given that q = -2, so -q/2 = 1. So substituting, we have:t = cube_root(1 + sqrt(1 + 1/27)) + cube_root(1 - sqrt(1 + 1/27))Simplify sqrt(28/27). Let me write sqrt(28/27) as sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) = (2*sqrt(7))/(3*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(21))/9 after rationalizing. So sqrt(28/27) = 2*sqrt(21)/9. So:t = cube_root(1 + 2*sqrt(21)/9) + cube_root(1 - 2*sqrt(21)/9)Hmm, this looks complicated. Let me compute these cube roots numerically to see if it gives me 1.First, compute sqrt(21) ≈ 4.58366. Then, 2*sqrt(21)/9 ≈ 2*4.58366/9 ≈9.16732/9≈1.0186. So 1 + 1.0186 ≈2.0186. Then cube root of 2.0186 ≈1.264. Then, 1 -1.0186 ≈-0.0186. Cube root of -0.0186 ≈-0.0265. Adding these two: 1.264 -0.0265≈1.2375. Hmm, that&#39;s approximately 1.2375, which is not exactly 1. But the actual root is 1. Hmm, maybe there&#39;s a mistake here.Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the steps again.Starting with Cardano&#39;s formula for t³ + pt + q =0. So the formula is:t = sqrt[3]{ -frac{q}{2} + sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3} } + sqrt[3]{ -frac{q}{2} - sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3} }In our case, p=1, q=-2. So:First term inside cube roots: -q/2 = -(-2)/2 =1Second term inside sqrt: (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 = (-2/2)^2 + (1/3)^3 = (-1)^2 + (1/27) =1 +1/27=28/27Therefore, sqrt(28/27)=sqrt(28)/sqrt(27)= (2*sqrt(7))/ (3*sqrt(3)) )= (2*sqrt(21))/9 ≈2*4.583/9≈9.166/9≈1.0185Therefore, the two terms inside the cube roots are:1 + 1.0185 ≈2.01851 -1.0185≈-0.0185So cube roots of 2.0185 and -0.0185. Let me compute them more accurately.Cube root of 2.0185: Let&#39;s recall that 1.26³ = 1.26*1.26=1.5876*1.26≈2.000, so 1.26³≈2.000. So cube root of 2.0185 is approximately 1.26 + a little bit. Let me compute 1.26³: 1.26*1.26=1.5876, 1.5876*1.26≈1.5876*1 +1.5876*0.2 +1.5876*0.06=1.5876 +0.31752 +0.095256≈1.5876+0.412776≈2.000376. Wow, so 1.26³≈2.000376. So cube root of 2.000376 is exactly 1.26. So cube root of 2.0185 is slightly more than 1.26, maybe 1.2605. Let&#39;s see. Let me compute (1.26 + delta)^3 =2.0185. Let delta be small. Expanding (1.26 + delta)^3 ≈1.26³ +3*(1.26)^2*delta. We know 1.26³≈2.000376. So 2.000376 +3*(1.5876)*delta ≈2.0185. So 3*1.5876=4.7628. So 4.7628*delta≈2.0185 -2.000376=0.018124. Therefore, delta≈0.018124 /4.7628≈0.0038. So approx. 1.26 +0.0038≈1.2638. So cube root of 2.0185≈1.2638.Similarly, cube root of -0.0185 is -cube_root(0.0185). Cube root of 0.0185: 0.0185^(1/3). Since 0.027 is 0.3³=0.027. So 0.0185 is less than 0.027, so cube root is less than 0.3. Let me compute 0.026³=0.000017576, wait no, 0.026*0.026=0.000676, *0.026≈0.000017576, which is way too small. Wait, no, 0.026 is 2.6*10^-2. Cubed is (2.6)^3 *10^-6=17.576*10^-6=0.000017576. That&#39;s 1.7576e-5. But we have 0.0185=1.85e-2. So cube root of 1.85e-2. Let&#39;s think in exponents. Let me write 0.0185=18.5*10^-3. So cube root is (18.5)^(1/3)*10^-1. 18.5^(1/3). Since 2.6³=17.576 and 2.7³=19.683. So 18.5 is between 2.6³ and 2.7³. Let me do a linear approximation. Between 2.6 and 2.7: 17.576 to 19.683. 18.5 -17.576=0.924. Total interval:19.683 -17.576=2.107. So 0.924/2.107≈0.438. So cube root≈2.6 +0.438*(0.1)=2.6+0.0438=2.6438. Therefore, cube root of 18.5≈2.6438, so cube root of 0.0185≈2.6438*10^-1≈0.26438. So cube root of -0.0185≈-0.26438.Therefore, adding the two cube roots:1.2638 -0.26438≈0.9994≈1. So approximately 1. That makes sense, since the real root is 1. So Cardano&#39;s formula gives us approximately 1, which matches our trial and error result. But wait, why does Cardano&#39;s formula give us this sum of cube roots that numerically evaluates to 1? Is there a way to express it more neatly? Maybe the expression simplifies to 1 exactly. Let me check.Suppose u = cube_root(1 + sqrt(28/27)) and v = cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27)). Then u + v =1.Let me verify if (u + v)^3 =1. Let&#39;s compute (u + v)^3 = u³ + v³ +3uv(u + v). We know that u³ =1 + sqrt(28/27) and v³=1 - sqrt(28/27). Therefore, u³ + v³=1 + sqrt(28/27) +1 - sqrt(28/27)=2. Then, 3uv(u + v). Let&#39;s compute uv. uv= cube_root[(1 + sqrt(28/27))(1 - sqrt(28/27))] = cube_root[1 - (sqrt(28/27))²] = cube_root[1 -28/27] = cube_root[-1/27] = -1/3. So uv= -1/3. Therefore, 3uv(u +v)=3*(-1/3)(u +v)= - (u +v). Therefore, (u +v)^3 =2 - (u +v). But we have (u +v)^3 + (u +v) -2=0. Which is exactly our original equation x³ +x -2=0 with x=u +v. Therefore, since x=1 is a root, (u +v)=1. Therefore, even though the expression from Cardano&#39;s formula looks complicated, it actually simplifies to 1. That&#39;s pretty neat. So the real root is indeed 1, and the other roots are complex. Therefore, both methods give the same real root, x=1, and the complex roots can be found by factoring the quadratic. So the solution is x=1, and the other two complex roots. But just to recap, Cardano&#39;s method gives an expression that simplifies to 1, which we found through trial and error. So even though the formula seems to involve cube roots of complicated numbers, it collapses to a simple integer because those cube roots are designed to cancel out the complex parts when summed. So in conclusion, the real solution is x=1, and the other two are complex numbers. Using both trial and error and Cardano&#39;s formula leads us to the same result.Final AnswerThe real solution is boxed{1}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the equation (x^3 + x - 2 = 0) using trial and error, we test integer values. We find that (x = 1) is a root since (1^3 + 1 - 2 = 0). Next, we factor the cubic polynomial using synthetic division. Dividing (x^3 + x - 2) by ((x - 1)) gives the quotient (x^2 + x + 2). Solving the quadratic equation (x^2 + x + 2 = 0) using the quadratic formula, we find the complex roots:[x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{-7}}{2} = frac{-1 pm isqrt{7}}{2}]Using Cardano&#39;s formula for the cubic equation (t^3 + pt + q = 0) with (p = 1) and (q = -2), we calculate:[t = sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} + sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} - sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}}]Substituting (p = 1) and (q = -2), we get:[t = sqrt[3]{1 + sqrt{frac{28}{27}}} + sqrt[3]{1 - sqrt{frac{28}{27}}}]Simplifying the terms under the cube roots and verifying numerically, we find that the expression simplifies to 1. This confirms that the real root is indeed (x = 1).Thus, the real solution to the equation (x^3 + x - 2 = 0) is (boxed{1}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, so I need to solve the equation x³ + x - 2 = 0 using trial and error first, and then Cardano&#39;s formula. Let me start with the trial and error method because that seems simpler. Trial and error usually means plugging in some numbers to see if they work. Let me try small integers first. Let&#39;s start with x=1. Plugging that in: 1³ + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Wait, that actually works! So x=1 is a root. But wait, the equation is cubic, so there should be three roots. Maybe this is the only real root, and the other two are complex? Let me check.If x=1 is a root, then I can factor (x - 1) out of the polynomial x³ + x - 2. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Let&#39;s do synthetic division with root 1.The coefficients of the polynomial x³ + x - 2 are 1 (for x³), 0 (for x² since it&#39;s missing), 1 (for x), and -2 (constant term). Setting up synthetic division:1 | 1  0  1  -2        1  1   2      1  1  2   0So the quotient polynomial is x² + x + 2. Therefore, the original polynomial factors as (x - 1)(x² + x + 2). To find the other roots, I need to solve x² + x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 - 8)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(-7)] / 2. So the other roots are (-1 ± i√7)/2. So by trial and error, I found x=1 as the real root, and the other two roots are complex. But the problem says to solve using trial and error and Cardano&#39;s formula. Maybe they want me to verify the real root via Cardano&#39;s method? Or perhaps apply Cardano&#39;s formula to get all roots? Let me check how Cardano&#39;s formula works.Cardano&#39;s formula is a method to solve cubic equations of the form t³ + pt + q = 0. The general solution involves substituting variables to eliminate the quadratic term, then using a formula involving cube roots. Our equation is already in the form x³ + x - 2 = 0, which is similar to t³ + pt + q = 0 with p=1 and q=-2. So we can apply the formula directly.The formula for the roots is: t = cube_root(-q/2 + sqrt((q/2)² + (p/3)³)) + cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt((q/2)² + (p/3)³)). Let&#39;s compute that step by step.First, compute (q/2)² + (p/3)³. Here, q = -2, so q/2 = -1. Then (q/2)² = (-1)² = 1. p = 1, so (p/3)³ = (1/3)³ = 1/27. Therefore, the discriminant is 1 + 1/27 = 28/27. Then sqrt(28/27) = sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) = (2*sqrt(7))/3*sqrt(3)) Hmm, wait. Let me compute that correctly. sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(7), and sqrt(27) is 3*sqrt(3). So sqrt(28/27) = (2*sqrt(7))/(3*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(21))/9. Wait, because sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) is sqrt(28/27) = sqrt(84)/9? Maybe better to leave it as sqrt(28)/3*sqrt(3)) but rationalizing the denominator. Alternatively, sqrt(28/27) = sqrt(84)/9. Wait, 28/27 is 28 divided by 27. 28 factors into 4*7, so sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7), so sqrt(28)/sqrt(27) = (2*sqrt(7))/(3*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(21))/9 after multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3).So sqrt(28/27) = (2√21)/9. Then, according to Cardano&#39;s formula, the solution is:t = cube_root( -q/2 + sqrt( (q/2)² + (p/3)³ ) ) + cube_root( -q/2 - sqrt( (q/2)² + (p/3)³ ) )Given q = -2, so -q/2 = 1. So the expression becomes:t = cube_root(1 + (2√21)/9) + cube_root(1 - (2√21)/9)Wait, but these cube roots might not be real numbers? Let&#39;s compute the terms inside the cube roots. Let&#39;s compute 1 + (2√21)/9 and 1 - (2√21)/9. Let&#39;s approximate √21. √21 ≈ 4.5837. So 2*4.5837 ≈ 9.1674. Then (2√21)/9 ≈ 9.1674/9 ≈ 1.0186. So 1 + 1.0186 ≈ 2.0186, and 1 - 1.0186 ≈ -0.0186. Therefore, the cube roots are cube_root(2.0186) + cube_root(-0.0186). The first cube root is approximately 1.264, and the second cube root is approximately -0.026. Adding them gives approximately 1.264 - 0.026 ≈ 1.238. But we know the real root is x=1. Hmm, that seems off. Maybe I made an error in calculation.Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values symbolically. Let&#39;s see. Let me denote u = cube_root(1 + sqrt(28/27)) and v = cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27)). Then t = u + v. But if u and v are real numbers, their sum should be real. However, sqrt(28/27) ≈ 1.018, so 1 + 1.018 ≈ 2.018, and 1 - 1.018 ≈ -0.018. Therefore, u is the cube root of ~2.018, which is approximately 1.264, and v is the cube root of ~-0.018, which is approximately -0.026. So adding them gives approximately 1.238. But the actual real root is 1. So why the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong. Let me check again. Wait, actually, Cardano&#39;s formula in this case (for depressed cubic t³ + pt + q = 0) is:t = cube_root(-q/2 + sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3)) + cube_root(-q/2 - sqrt((q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3))But in our case, p=1, q=-2. Then:(q/2)^2 = (-2/2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1(p/3)^3 = (1/3)^3 = 1/27Thus discriminant D = (q/2)^2 + (p/3)^3 = 1 + 1/27 = 28/27. Then sqrt(D) = sqrt(28/27) as above.So then, the terms inside the cube roots are:First term: -q/2 + sqrt(D) = -(-2)/2 + sqrt(28/27) = 1 + sqrt(28/27)Second term: -q/2 - sqrt(D) = 1 - sqrt(28/27)So t = cube_root(1 + sqrt(28/27)) + cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27))But when I compute this numerically, I get approximately cube_root(2.018) + cube_root(-0.018) ≈ 1.264 - 0.026 ≈ 1.238, but the actual root is 1. What&#39;s going on here?Ah, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me check with more precise calculations.Compute sqrt(28/27):28/27 ≈ 1.037037...sqrt(1.037037) ≈ 1.018349So 1 + sqrt(28/27) ≈ 1 + 1.018349 ≈ 2.018349cube_root(2.018349) ≈ 1.264 (since 1.26^3 ≈ 2.000, 1.264^3 ≈ let&#39;s compute 1.264*1.264 = 1.597, 1.597*1.264 ≈ 2.019). So cube_root(2.018349) ≈ 1.264Then 1 - sqrt(28/27) ≈ 1 - 1.018349 ≈ -0.018349cube_root(-0.018349) ≈ -0.0262 (since (-0.0262)^3 ≈ -0.0000179, which is way too small. Wait, wait, something&#39;s wrong here. Wait, (-0.026)^3 = (-0.026)*(-0.026) = 0.000676, then *(-0.026) ≈ -0.000017576. But the number inside is -0.018349, which is -0.018349. So cube_root(-0.018349) is approximately -0.0262? But (-0.0262)^3 ≈ -0.0000179, which is way smaller than -0.018349. Wait, no, that&#39;s not correct. Let me compute cube_root(-0.018349):We know that (-0.26)^3 = -0.017576, so (-0.26)^3 = -0.017576, which is close to -0.018349. So cube_root(-0.018349) ≈ -0.26 + some small delta. Let&#39;s compute:Let me let x = -0.26 + δ, where δ is small. Then x³ ≈ (-0.26)^3 + 3*(-0.26)^2*δ = -0.017576 + 3*(0.0676)*δ = -0.017576 + 0.2028*δ. Set this equal to -0.018349:-0.017576 + 0.2028*δ = -0.018349So 0.2028*δ = -0.018349 + 0.017576 = -0.000773Therefore, δ ≈ -0.000773 / 0.2028 ≈ -0.00381. So x ≈ -0.26 - 0.00381 ≈ -0.2638. Therefore, cube_root(-0.018349) ≈ -0.2638.Wait, but then the sum of the two cube roots would be 1.264 + (-0.2638) ≈ 1.0002. Which is approximately 1, which matches the actual root x=1. So that makes sense. So the approximate value using Cardano&#39;s formula gives us approximately 1, which is accurate. The discrepancy before was because I miscalculated the cube root of the negative number. So in reality, the cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27)) is approximately -0.2638, and adding to 1.264 gives roughly 1.0002, which is very close to 1.Therefore, using Cardano&#39;s formula, we get the real root as approximately 1. So that matches the trial and error result.But how does this exact expression evaluate to 1? Let me see if we can express it in terms of radicals that simplify to 1. Let me denote:Let’s set u = cube_root(1 + sqrt(28/27)) and v = cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27)). Then the real root is u + v = 1. Let me check if u + v = 1. Let&#39;s cube both sides:(u + v)^3 = u³ + v³ + 3uv(u + v)But u³ = 1 + sqrt(28/27), and v³ = 1 - sqrt(28/27). So u³ + v³ = [1 + sqrt(28/27)] + [1 - sqrt(28/27)] = 2. Also, 3uv(u + v) = 3uv*(1). So:1³ = 2 + 3uv*1 =&gt; 1 = 2 + 3uv =&gt; 3uv = -1 =&gt; uv = -1/3Now, let&#39;s compute uv:uv = cube_root(1 + sqrt(28/27)) * cube_root(1 - sqrt(28/27)) = cube_root[(1 + sqrt(28/27))(1 - sqrt(28/27))] = cube_root[1 - (sqrt(28/27))²] = cube_root[1 - 28/27] = cube_root[-1/27] = -1/3So uv = -1/3, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the equation holds. Therefore, u + v = 1 is indeed a solution. So this shows that even though the expression looks complicated, it simplifies to 1. Therefore, using Cardano&#39;s formula, we get the real root as 1, and the other roots can be found by factoring, as we did earlier, leading to complex roots. Therefore, the equation x³ + x - 2 = 0 has one real root x=1 and two complex roots (-1 ± i√7)/2. Both methods, trial and error and Cardano&#39;s formula, lead us to the real solution x=1. But just to recap, trial and error gave x=1 immediately, then we factored out (x - 1) and solved the quadratic. Using Cardano&#39;s formula, even though the expression looks complex, it simplifies to the same real root x=1 when computed either approximately or through algebraic manipulation. Therefore, both methods confirm the real root, and the complex roots are found through factoring.Final AnswerThe real solution is boxed{1}.&lt;/think&gt;To solve the equation (x^3 + x - 2 = 0) using trial and error, we test small integers. Trying (x = 1):[1^3 + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0]Thus, (x = 1) is a root. Factoring out ((x - 1)) from the polynomial, we perform synthetic division:[begin{array}{r|rrrr}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 hline  &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 end{array}]The quotient polynomial is (x^2 + x + 2). Solving (x^2 + x + 2 = 0) using the quadratic formula:[x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 - 8}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{-7}}{2} = frac{-1 pm isqrt{7}}{2}]Thus, the complex roots are (frac{-1 pm isqrt{7}}{2}).Using Cardano&#39;s formula for the depressed cubic (t^3 + pt + q = 0) with (p = 1) and (q = -2):1. Compute the discriminant:   [   left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3 = left(frac{-2}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 = 1 + frac{1}{27} = frac{28}{27}   ]2. The solution is:   [   t = sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} + sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}} + sqrt[3]{-frac{q}{2} - sqrt{left(frac{q}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{p}{3}right)^3}}   ]3. Substituting values:   [   t = sqrt[3]{1 + sqrt{frac{28}{27}}} + sqrt[3]{1 - sqrt{frac{28}{27}}}   ]4. Simplifying the cube roots, we find that the expression evaluates to 1, confirming the real root (x = 1).Both methods confirm the real root (x = 1). The complex roots are (frac{-1 pm isqrt{7}}{2}).[boxed{1}]]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>The equation has an obvious root x=1.

I need to find the set difference M  N, which means all elements that are in M but not in N. First, let me recall what sets M and N are.Set M is defined as {x | -1 &lt; x &lt; 1}. So in interval notation, that&#39;s just (-1, 1). Easy enough.Now set N is {x | x/(x - 1) ≤ 0}. Hmm, solving inequalities can sometimes be tricky. Let me remember how to handle rational inequalities like this. The inequality is x/(x - 1) ≤ 0. To solve this, I need to find where the expression is negative or zero.First, let&#39;s find when the expression is zero. The fraction x/(x - 1) is zero when the numerator is zero (as long as the denominator isn&#39;t zero). So x = 0. But when x = 1, the denominator is zero, so x = 1 is excluded from the domain.Next, to determine where the expression is negative, I can analyze the sign of the numerator and denominator. Let&#39;s break down the critical points where the expression can change sign. The critical points are x = 0 (where numerator is zero) and x = 1 (where denominator is zero). So these points divide the real line into intervals: (-∞, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ∞).Now, let&#39;s test each interval:1. Interval (-∞, 0): Pick x = -1. Then numerator is -1 (negative), denominator is -1 - 1 = -2 (negative). Negative divided by negative is positive. So the expression is positive here.2. Interval (0, 1): Pick x = 0.5. Numerator is 0.5 (positive), denominator is 0.5 - 1 = -0.5 (negative). Positive divided by negative is negative. So the expression is negative here.3. Interval (1, ∞): Pick x = 2. Numerator is 2 (positive), denominator is 2 - 1 = 1 (positive). Positive divided by positive is positive. So the expression is positive here.So the expression x/(x - 1) is negative in (0, 1). Now, we also need to check the critical points. At x = 0, the expression is 0, which satisfies the inequality ≤ 0. At x = 1, the expression is undefined, so we exclude it.Therefore, the solution to the inequality x/(x - 1) ≤ 0 is [0, 1). So set N is [0, 1).Wait, hold on. Let me confirm that. When x approaches 1 from the left, denominator approaches 0 from the negative side, so the expression goes to negative infinity. But wait, in the interval (0,1), the expression is negative, but at x=0, it&#39;s 0, which is included. So yes, combining these, N is [0, 1).Wait, but in the inequality, it&#39;s ≤ 0. So including where the expression is zero or negative. So x=0 is included, and the interval (0,1) is where it&#39;s negative. So N is [0, 1).Therefore, N is the interval [0, 1).Now, set M is (-1, 1). So M  N would be all elements in M that are not in N. So since M is from -1 to 1, and N is from 0 to 1 (including 0 but not including 1), subtracting N from M would leave the part of M that&#39;s from -1 to 0. But wait, we need to check if 0 is included or not.In M, since it&#39;s (-1, 1), 0 is included in M because it&#39;s between -1 and 1. However, in N, which is [0, 1), 0 is included. So when we subtract N from M, we remove all elements from M that are in N. Since N starts at 0, including 0, then M  N would be (-1, 0). Wait, but hold on: M is (-1, 1), which does not include -1 and 1. N is [0,1), which includes 0 but not 1. So when subtracting N from M, we remove all x in M where x is in [0,1). Therefore, the remaining elements are those in M that are less than 0. So that&#39;s (-1, 0).But let me double-check. For example, take x = -0.5: it&#39;s in M because -1 &lt; -0.5 &lt; 1, and it&#39;s not in N because N starts at 0. So x = -0.5 is in M  N. Similarly, x = 0: in M, but 0 is in N, so it&#39;s excluded. x = 0.5: in M and in N, so excluded. x approaching 1 from the left: in M but also in N, so excluded. So yes, the interval (-1, 0) is M  N.But wait, in set notation, is that correct? Let me confirm.M is (-1,1). N is [0,1). So subtracting N from M would remove all elements from M that are in [0,1). Therefore, the remaining elements in M  N are the elements of M that are less than 0. So from -1 to 0, but not including -1 and 0? Wait, no: wait, M includes all x where -1 &lt; x &lt; 1. So 0 is included in M. But since 0 is in N, we need to exclude it. So the set M  N is all x such that -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 and x not in [0,1). Therefore, that&#39;s -1 &lt; x &lt; 0. Because once you remove [0,1) from (-1,1), you&#39;re left with (-1,0). So in interval notation, that&#39;s (-1, 0).But wait, another way to think about it: if M is (-1,1) and N is [0,1), then M  N is the part of M that&#39;s not in N. Since N covers from 0 to 1 (including 0), the part not in N would be from -1 to 0. But since M doesn&#39;t include -1, it&#39;s (-1,0). So yes, that seems right.But let me check with specific points again. Take x = -1: not in M. x = -0.5: in M, not in N, so included in M  N. x = 0: in M, but also in N, so excluded. x = 0.5: in M and in N, so excluded. x = 1: not in M. So yes, only the interval from -1 to 0, not including -1 and 0. Wait, but hold on: if N is [0,1), which includes 0, so even though M includes 0, we have to subtract 0 as well. So M  N is (-1,0), since 0 is removed.Therefore, the answer should be (-1, 0) in interval notation.But wait, let me also think about whether there&#39;s any other part of N that might intersect with M. Since N is [0,1), and M is (-1,1). So the intersection of M and N is [0,1). Therefore, subtracting that from M gives (-1,1) minus [0,1) is (-1,0).Yes, that seems correct. So M  N is (-1,0).Final AnswerThe set difference ( M setminus N ) in interval notation is boxed{(-1, 0)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the sets ( M = {x mid -1 &lt; x &lt; 1} ) and ( N = left{x mid frac{x}{x - 1} leq 0 right} ), we need to express the difference of sets ( M ) and ( N ) (M  N) in interval notation.1. Set ( M ):   - ( M ) is defined as ( {x mid -1 &lt; x &lt; 1} ), which in interval notation is ( (-1, 1) ).2. Set ( N ):   - To solve the inequality ( frac{x}{x - 1} leq 0 ):     - The critical points are ( x = 0 ) (where the numerator is zero) and ( x = 1 ) (where the denominator is zero).     - Analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by the critical points:       - For ( x in (-infty, 0) ), the expression is positive.       - For ( x in (0, 1) ), the expression is negative.       - For ( x in (1, infty) ), the expression is positive.     - The expression is zero at ( x = 0 ) and undefined at ( x = 1 ).     - Therefore, the solution to the inequality is ( [0, 1) ), so ( N = [0, 1) ).3. Set Difference ( M setminus N ):   - ( M setminus N ) consists of all elements in ( M ) that are not in ( N ).   - ( M = (-1, 1) ) and ( N = [0, 1) ).   - Subtracting ( N ) from ( M ) removes the interval ( [0, 1) ) from ( (-1, 1) ), leaving the interval ( (-1, 0) ).Thus, the set difference ( M setminus N ) in interval notation is (boxed{(-1, 0)}).,&lt;think&gt;Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have two sets, M and N. M is defined as all real numbers x such that -1 &lt; x &lt; 1. That part seems straightforward; M is the open interval from -1 to 1. Then set N is a bit trickier. It&#39;s given by the inequality (x)/(x - 1) ≤ 0. I need to solve this inequality first to figure out what N is, and then find the difference M  N, which means all elements that are in M but not in N. Let me break this down step by step.Starting with set N: the inequality is (x)/(x - 1) ≤ 0. To solve rational inequalities like this, I remember that we need to find the critical points where the expression equals zero or is undefined. The numerator is x, so the expression equals zero when x = 0. The denominator is x - 1, so the expression is undefined when x = 1. These critical points divide the real number line into intervals that we can test.So, critical points at x = 0 and x = 1. That gives us three intervals to consider:1. (-∞, 0)2. (0, 1)3. (1, ∞)Now, I need to test each interval to see if the inequality (x)/(x - 1) ≤ 0 holds there.Let&#39;s start with the first interval, (-∞, 0). Pick a test point, say x = -1.Plugging into the expression: (-1)/(-1 - 1) = (-1)/(-2) = 0.5. That&#39;s positive, so the inequality (which is ≤ 0) is not satisfied here. So this interval is not part of the solution.Next interval, (0, 1). Let&#39;s pick x = 0.5.Plugging in: (0.5)/(0.5 - 1) = (0.5)/(-0.5) = -1. That&#39;s negative, which satisfies the inequality. Also, since the inequality includes equality (≤), we need to check the critical points. At x = 0, the expression is 0/(0 - 1) = 0, which is equal to 0, so x = 0 is included. At x = 1, the expression is undefined, so x = 1 is not included. So the interval [0, 1) is part of the solution.Third interval, (1, ∞). Let&#39;s take x = 2.Plugging in: 2/(2 - 1) = 2/1 = 2. Positive, so doesn&#39;t satisfy the inequality. Therefore, this interval isn&#39;t part of the solution.So, putting this together, the solution set N is [0, 1).Wait, let me double-check. The critical points: x=0 and x=1. At x=0, the expression is zero, which is allowed because the inequality is ≤ 0. At x=1, it&#39;s undefined, so excluded. So the solution is where the expression is negative or zero. Testing intervals:For x &lt; 0, positive (from x=-1 test). Between 0 and 1, negative (from x=0.5 test). For x &gt; 1, positive (from x=2 test). So yes, the solution is [0, 1). Therefore, set N is [0, 1).Now, set M is (-1, 1). The difference M  N would be all elements in M that are not in N. Since N is [0, 1), which overlaps with M from 0 to 1. So M is from -1 to 1, excluding endpoints. N is from 0 to 1, including 0 but excluding 1. So subtracting N from M would leave the part of M that&#39;s not in N. That is, from -1 to 0, not including 0, since N includes 0. Wait, let me visualize this.M is (-1, 1). N is [0, 1). So M  N is all the numbers in M that are not in N. So in M, numbers from -1 up to but not including 1, and subtracting the numbers from 0 up to but not including 1. So what&#39;s left is the numbers from -1 up to 0, because those are in M but not in N. However, since N includes 0, but M does not include 0? Wait, hold on. Wait, M is (-1, 1), so 0 is included in M. But N is [0, 1). So 0 is in N. Therefore, when we take M  N, we need to exclude all elements in N, including 0. Therefore, M  N would be (-1, 0).Wait, let me confirm. Let me write the intervals:M = (-1, 1)N = [0, 1)So M  N is the set of x such that x is in M and x is not in N.So x has to satisfy -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 and not (0 ≤ x &lt; 1). So that means x must be in (-1, 1) but not in [0, 1). Therefore, the remaining part is (-1, 0). Because from -1 to 0, x is still in M but not in N. Since N starts at 0, inclusive, so 0 is excluded from M  N. So yes, the interval is (-1, 0).But wait, let me check if 0 is in M. M is (-1, 1), so 0 is included. But N includes 0. Therefore, 0 is in both M and N, so 0 would be excluded from M  N. Therefore, M  N is (-1, 0).Is that correct? Let me think again. Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose x = -0.5. It&#39;s in M because -1 &lt; -0.5 &lt; 1, and it&#39;s not in N because N starts at 0. So -0.5 is in M  N. What about x = 0? 0 is in M and in N, so not in M  N. What about x = 0.5? 0.5 is in M and in N, so excluded. x = -1: not in M. x = 1: not in M. So yes, the interval should be (-1, 0).Wait, but I should double-check if I interpreted the inequality correctly for set N. The inequality was (x)/(x - 1) ≤ 0. Let me confirm the solution again.The inequality (x)/(x - 1) ≤ 0.Multiply both sides by (x - 1), but we have to be careful because the sign of (x - 1) affects the inequality direction. Alternatively, use a sign chart.Critical points at x = 0 (numerator zero) and x = 1 (denominator zero). So intervals as before.For x &lt; 0: numerator negative, denominator negative (since x -1 &lt; -1 &lt; 0). So negative divided by negative is positive. So the expression is positive, which does not satisfy ≤ 0.For 0 &lt; x &lt;1: numerator positive (x &gt;0), denominator negative (x -1 &lt;0). So positive divided by negative is negative. So expression is negative, which satisfies ≤ 0.For x &gt;1: numerator positive, denominator positive. So expression positive, does not satisfy.At x=0: expression is 0/(0-1) = 0, which satisfies ≤0, so included.At x=1: undefined.Therefore, solution is [0,1). So that&#39;s correct.Therefore, N is [0,1). Then M is (-1,1). So subtracting N from M gives all elements in M not in N, which is (-1,0). Because from -1 to 0 (excluding 0?), wait, no. Wait, in M, the upper bound is 1, excluded. N is [0,1). So in M, from -1 to 1, subtract the interval from 0 to 1. So the remaining part is from -1 to 0. But since N includes 0, which is included in M? Wait, M is (-1,1), which does not include 1 but includes all numbers between -1 and 1. So 0 is in M. But N is [0,1), so 0 is in N. Therefore, when subtracting N from M, we need to remove 0 as well. Therefore, the interval is (-1,0). Because 0 is in N, so it&#39;s excluded from M  N.Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, M  N is (-1,0) in interval notation.But let me make sure there are no mistakes here. Let me consider the definitions again.Set difference M  N is defined as {x | x ∈ M and x ∉ N}. So any x that is in M but not in N.M is (-1,1), so x must be greater than -1 and less than 1.N is [0,1), so x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.Therefore, x is in M  N if x is in (-1,1) but not in [0,1). So that would be x &lt; 0 and x &gt; -1, because once you remove [0,1) from (-1,1), the remaining part is (-1,0).Yes, that&#39;s correct. Therefore, the answer is (-1, 0).I think that&#39;s the correct interval notation for M  N.Final AnswerThe difference of sets M and N in interval notation is boxed{(-1, 0)}.&lt;/think&gt;Given the sets ( M = {x mid -1 &lt; x &lt; 1} ) and ( N = left{x mid frac{x}{x - 1} leq 0 right} ), we need to express the difference of sets ( M ) and ( N ) (i.e., ( M setminus N )) in interval notation.1. Determine set ( M ):   - ( M ) is the open interval ((-1, 1)).2. Solve the inequality for set ( N ):   - The inequality (frac{x}{x - 1} leq 0) is solved by finding the critical points ( x = 0 ) (where the numerator is zero) and ( x = 1 ) (where the denominator is zero).   - Testing intervals around these critical points:     - For ( x &lt; 0 ), the expression is positive.     - For ( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 ), the expression is negative.     - For ( x &gt; 1 ), the expression is positive.   - Including the critical point ( x = 0 ) (since the inequality is non-strict) and excluding ( x = 1 ) (since the expression is undefined there), the solution is ([0, 1)).3. Determine the difference ( M setminus N ):   - ( M = (-1, 1) )   - ( N = [0, 1) )   - Subtracting ( N ) from ( M ) removes the interval ([0, 1)) from ((-1, 1)), leaving the interval ((-1, 0)).Thus, the difference of sets ( M ) and ( N ) in interval notation is (boxed{(-1, 0)}).]</p><div class="divider" data-v-cb5dd192></div><p class="review-content" data-v-cb5dd192><span class="icon" data-v-cb5dd192>🔑:</span>First, let&#39;s translate the given sets:M = {x | -1  0 since x &gt; 0. Thus, the entire fraction is non-negative, which does not satisfy the given inequality.2. x &lt; 0: In this case, x - 1 &lt; -1, which means x - 1 &lt; 0. Thus, the numerator and denominator have opposite signs, resulting in a positive fraction, which also does not satisfy the given inequality.However, when x = 0, the fraction is undefined, so we exclude this value from the set. Therefore, N = [0, 1).Now we can find the difference of sets M and N: M  N = (-1, 0).So the answer is: M  N = boxed{(-1, 0)}.</p></div></div><!--]--></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-c9a649a3><span data-v-c9a649a3>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 OpenR</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
